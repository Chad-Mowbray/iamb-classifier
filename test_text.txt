     All devil as I am--a damned wretch,
     A hardened, stubborn, unrepenting villain,
     Still my heart melts at human wretchedness;
     And with sincere but unavailing sighs
     I view the helpless children of distress:
     With tears indignant I behold the oppressor
     Rejoicing in the honest man's destruction,
     Whose unsubmitting heart was all his crime.--
     Ev'n you, ye hapless crew! I pity you;
     Ye, whom the seeming good think sin to pity;
     Ye poor, despised, abandoned vagabonds,
     Whom Vice, as usual, has turn'd o'er to ruin.
     Oh! but for friends and interposing Heaven,
     I had been driven forth like you forlorn,
     The most detested, worthless wretch among you!
     O injured God! Thy goodness has endow'd me
     With talents passing most of my compeers,
     Which I in just proportion have abused--
     As far surpassing other common villains
     As Thou in natural parts has given me more.
