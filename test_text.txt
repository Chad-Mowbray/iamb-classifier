Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
For all the day they view things unrespected
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
How would thy shadow form form happy show
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
All days are nights to see till I see thee
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
Injurious distance should not stop my way
For then despite of space I would be brought
From limits far remote where thou dost stay
No matter then although my foot did stand
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
As soon as think the place where he would be
But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
But that so much of earth and water wrought
I must attend time leisure with my moan
Receiving nought by elements so slow
But heavy tears badges of either woe
The other two slight air and purging fire
Are both with thee wherever I abide
The first my thought the other my desire
These present-absent with swift motion slide
For when these quicker elements are gone
In tender embassy of love to thee
My life being made of four with two alone
Sinks down to death oppress'd with melancholy
Until life composition be recured
By those swift messengers return'd from thee
Who even but now come back again assured
Of thy fair health recounting it to me
This told I joy but then no longer glad
I send them back again and straight grow sad
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
How to divide the conquest of thy sight
Mine eye my heart thy picture sight would bar
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie 
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes 
But the defendant doth that plea deny
