On this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight
Where Goneril's soul made chill and foul the mist,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
Who hymned the song of Peace o'er Bethlehem's fields!
Now is the time that face should form another;
The whole world, visible, audible, was he:
From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns,
Of consentaneous love inspires all life:
To myriads, who still grow beneath her care,
Space, matter, time and mind let the sight
Whose roar is wakened into echoings sweet
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
Parted in slumber, whence the regular breath
Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine
A drop of poison falls. Come hearken to me,
I only saw great Herè’s angry eyes,
