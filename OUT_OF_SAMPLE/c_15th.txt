Sweit rois of vertew and of gentilnes,
Delytsum lyllie of everie lustynes,
Richest in bontie and in bewtie cleir
And everie vertew that is deir,
Except onlie that ye are mercyles.
Into your garthe this day I did persew.
Thair saw I flowris that fresche wer of hew,
Baithe quhyte and rid, moist lusty wer to seyne,
And halsum herbis upone stalkis grene,
Yit leif nor flour fynd could I nane of rew.
I dout that Merche with his caild blastis keyne
Hes slane this gentill herbe that I of mene,
Quhois petewous deithe dois to my hart sic pane
That I wald mak to plant his rute agane,
So that confortand his levis unto me bene.
My hartis tresure and swete assured fo,
The finale endar of my lyfe forever,
The creuell brekar of my hart in tuo,
To go to deathe this I deservit never.
O man slayar, quhill saule and life dissever,
Stynt of your slauchtir, allace, your man am I,
A thousand tymes that dois yow mercy cry.
Have mercie, luif, have mercie, ladie bricht.
Quhat have I wrocht aganis your womanheid
That ye suld murdir me, a saikles wicht,
Trespassing never to yow in word nor deid?
That ye consent thairto, O God forbid!
Leif creuelté and saif your man, for schame,
Or throucht the warld quyte losit is your name.
My deathe chasis my lyfe so besalie
That wery is my goist to fle so fast.
Sic deidlie dwawmes so mischeifaislie
Ane hundrithe tymes hes my hairt ovirpast.
Me think my spreit rynnis away full gast,
Beseikand grace on kneis yow befoir,
Or that your man be lost for evermoir.
Behald my wod, intollerabill pane,
Forevermoir quhilk sal be my dampnage.
Quhy undir traist your man thus have ye slane?
Lo, deithe is in my breist with furious rage,
Quhilk may no balme nor tryacle assuage
Bot your mercie, for laik of quhilk I de.
Allace, quhair is your womanlie petie?
Behald my deidlie passioun dolorous,
Behald my hiddous hew and wo, allace.
Behald my mayne and murning mervalous,
Withe sorrowfull teris falling frome my face.
Rewthe, luif, is nocht, helpe ye not in this cace,
For how sould ony gentill hart indure
To se this sycht on ony creature?
Quhyte dov, quhair is your sobir humilnes?
Swete gentill turtour, quhair is your peté went?
Quhair is your rewthe, the frute of nobilnes,
Of womanheid the tresour and the rent?
Mercie is never put out of meik intent,
Nor out of gentill hart is fundin petie,
Sen mercyles may no weycht nobill be.
Into my mynd I sall you mercye cry
Quhone that my toung sall faill me to speik,
And quhill that Nature me my sycht deny,
And quhill my ene for pane incluse and steik,
And quhill the dethe my hart in soundir breik,
And quhill my mynd may think and toung may steir -
And syne, fair weill, my hartis lady deir!
Ryght as the stern of day begouth to schyne,
Quhen gone to bed war Vesper and Lucyne,
I raise and by a rosere did me rest.
Up sprang the goldyn candill matutyne
With clere depurit bemes cristallyne
Glading the mery foulis in thair nest.
Or Phebus was in purpur cape revest
Up raise the lark, the hevyns menstrale fyne,
In May intill a morow myrthfullest.
Full angel-like thir birdis sang thair houris
Within thair courtyns grene into thair bouris
Apparalit quhite and rede wyth blomes suete;
Anamalit was the felde wyth all colouris.
The perly droppis schuke in silvir schouris,
Quhill all in balme did branch and levis flete.
To part fra Phebus did Aurora grete -
Hir cristall teris I saw hyng on the flouris,
Quhilk he for lufe all drank up wyth his hete.
For mirth of May wyth skippis and wyth hoppis
The birdis sang upon the tender croppis
With curiouse note, as Venus chapell clerkis.
The rosis yong, new spreding of thair knopis,
War powderit brycht with hevinly beriall droppis
Throu bemes rede birnyng as ruby sperkis.
The skyes rang for schoutying of the larkis,
The purpur hevyn, ourscailit in silvir sloppis,
Ourgilt the treis branchis, lef, and barkis.
Doun throu the ryce a ryvir ran wyth stremys
So lustily agayn thai lykand lemys
That all the lake as lamp did leme of licht,
Quhilk schadowit all about wyth twynkling glemis.
The bewis bathit war in secund bemys
Throu the reflex of Phebus visage brycht.
On every syde the hegies raise on hicht,
The bank was grene, the bruke was full of bremys,
The stanneris clere as stern in frosty nycht.
The cristall air, the sapher firmament,
The ruby skyes of the orient,
Kest beriall bemes on emerant bewis grene.
The rosy garth, depaynt and redolent,
With purpur, azure, gold, and goulis gent
Arayed was by Dame Flora, the quene,
So nobily that joy was for to sene
The roch agayn the rivir resplendent,
As low enlumynit all the leves schene.
Quhat throu the mery foulys armony
And throu the ryveris soun rycht ran me by,
On Florais mantill I slepit as I lay;
Quhare sone into my dremes fantasy
I saw approch agayn the orient sky
A saill als quhite as blossum upon spray,
Wyth merse of gold brycht as the stern of day,
Quhilk tendit to the land full lustily,
As falcoun swift desyrouse of hir pray.
And hard on burd unto the blomyt medis
Amang the grene rispis and the redis
Arrivit sche; quhar fro anon thare landis
Ane hundreth ladyes, lusty into wedis,
Als fresch as flouris that in May up spredis,
In kirtillis grene, withoutyn kell or bandis.
Thair brycht hairis hang gleting on the strandis
In tressis clere, wyppit wyth goldyn thredis,
With pappis quhite and mydlis small as wandis.
Discrive I wald, bot quho coud wele endyte
How all the feldis wyth thai lilies quhite
Depaynt war brycht, quhilk to the hevyn did glete?
Noucht thou, Omer, als fair as thou coud wryte,
For all thine ornate stilis so perfyte.
Nor yit thou, Tullius, quhois lippis swete
Of rethorike did into termes flete.
Your aureate tongis both bene all to lyte
For to compile that paradise complete.
Thare saw I Nature and Venus, quene and quene,
The fresch Aurora and Lady Flora schene,
Juno, Appollo, and Proserpyna,
Dyane, the goddesse chaste of woddis grene,
My Lady Cleo, that help of makaris bene,
Thetes, Pallas, and prudent Minerva,
Fair feynit Fortune, and lemand Lucina.
Thir mychti quenis in crounis mycht be sene
Wyth bemys blith, bricht as Lucifera.
Thare saw I May, of myrthfull monethis quene,
Betuix Aprile and June hir sistir schene,
Within the gardyng walking up and doun,
Quham of the foulis gladdith all bedene.
Scho was full tender in hir yeris grene.
Thare saw I Nature present hir a goun
Rich to behald and nobil of renoun,
Of eviry hew under the hevin that bene,
Depaynt and broud be gude proporcioun.
Full lustily thir ladyes all in fere
Enterit within this park of most plesere,
Quhare that I lay ourhelit wyth levis ronk.
The mery foulis blisfullest of chere
Salust Nature, me thoucht, on thair manere;
And eviry blome on branch and eke on bonk
Opnyt and spred thair balmy levis donk,
Full low enclynyng to thair quene so clere
Quham of thair noble norising thay thonk.
Syne to Dame Flora on the samyn wyse
Thay saluse and thay thank a thousand syse,
And to Dame Venus, lufis mychti quene,
Thay sang ballettis in lufe, as was the gyse,
With amourouse notis lusty to devise
As thay that had lufe in thair hertis grene.
Thair hony throtis opnyt fro the splene
With werblis suete did perse the hevinly skyes,
Quhill loud resownyt the firmament serene.
Aneothir court thare saw I consequent
Cupide the king, wyth bow in hand ybent
And dredefull arowis grundyn scharp and square.
Thare saw I Mars the god armypotent,
Aufull and sterne, strong and corpolent.
Thare saw I crabbit Saturn, ald and haire -
His luke was lyke for to perturb the aire.
Thare was Mercurius, wise and eloquent,
Of rethorike that fand the flouris faire.
Thare was the god of gardingis, Priapus,
Thare was the god of wildernes, Phanus,
And Janus, god of entree delytable.
Thare was the god of fludis, Neptunus,
Thare was the god of wyndis, Eolus,
With variand luke rycht lyke a lord unstable.
Thare was Bacus, the gladder of the table,
There was Pluto, the elrich incubus,
In cloke of grene - his court usit no sable -
And eviry one of thir in grene arayit.
On harp or lute full merily thai playit,
And sang ballettis with michty notis clere.
Ladyes to dance full sobirly assayit,
Endlang the lusty ryvir so thai mayit
Thair observance rycht hevynly was to here.
Than crap I throu the levis and drew nere
Quhare that I was rycht sudaynly affrayt,
All throu a luke quhilk I have boucht full dere.
