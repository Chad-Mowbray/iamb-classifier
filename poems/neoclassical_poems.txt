Must noble Hastings immaturely die
The honour of his ancient family
Beauty and learning thus together meet
To bring a winding for a wedding-sheet
Must Virtue prove Death harbinger must she
With him expiring feel mortality
Is death Sin wages Grace now shall Art
Make us more learned only to depart
If merit be disease if virtue death
To be good not to be who'd then bequeath 
Himself to discipline who'd not esteem
Labour a crime study self-murder deem
Our noble youth now have pretence to be
Dunces securely ignorant healthfully
Rare linguist whose worth speaks itself whose praise
Though not his own all tongues besides do raise
Than whom great Alexander may seem less
Who conquer'd men but not their languages
In his mouth nations spake his tongue might be
Interpreter to Greece France Italy 
His native soil was the four parts o' the Earth
All Europe was too narrow for his birth
A young apostle and with reverence may
I speak it inspired with gift of tongues as they
Nature gave him a child what men in vain
Oft strive by art though further'd to obtain
His body was an orb his sublime soul
Did move on Virtue and on Learning pole
Whose regular motions better to our view
Than Archimedes sphere the Heavens did show 
Graces and virtues languages and arts
Beauty and learning fill'd up all the parts
Heaven gifts which do like falling stars appear
Scatter'd in others all as in their sphere
Were fix'd conglobate in his soul and thence
Shone through his body with sweet influence
Letting their glories so on each limb fall
The whole frame render'd was celestial
Come learned Ptolemy and trial make
If thou this hero altitude canst take 
But that transcends thy skill thrice happy all
Could we but prove thus astronomical
Lived Tycho now struck with this ray which shone
More bright i' the morn than others' beam at noon
He'd take his astrolabe and seek out here
What new star 'twas did gild our hemisphere
Replenish'd then with such rare gifts as these
Where was room left for such a foul disease
The nation sin hath drawn that veil which shrouds
Our day-spring in so sad benighting clouds 
Heaven would no longer trust its pledge but thus
Recall'd it rapt its Ganymede from us
Was there no milder way but the small-pox
The very filthiness of Pandora box
So many spots like naeves on Venus' soil
One jewel set off with so many a foil
Blisters with pride swell'd which through flesh did sprout
Like rose-buds stuck i' th' lily-skin about
Each little pimple had a tear in it
To wail the fault its rising did commit 
Which rebel-like with its own lord at strife
Thus made an insurrection 'gainst his life
Or were these gems sent to adorn his skin
The cabinet of a richer soul within
No comet need foretell his change drew on
Whose corpse might seem a constellation
Oh had he died of old how great a strife
Had been who from his death should draw their life
Who should by one rich draught become whate'er
Seneca Cato Numa Caesar were  
Learn'd virtuous pious great and have by this
An universal metempsychosis
Must all these aged sires in one funeral
Expire all die in one so young so small
Who had he lived his life out his great fame
Had swoln 'bove any Greek or Roman name
But hasty Winter with one blast hath brought
The hopes of Autumn Summer Spring to nought
Thus fades the oak i' the sprig i' the blade the corn
Thus without young this Phoenix dies new born 
Must then old three-legg'd graybeards with their gout
Catarrhs rheums aches live three long ages out
Time offals only fit for the hospital
Or to hang antiquaries' rooms withal
Must drunkards lechers spent with sinning live
With such helps as broths possets physic give
None live but such as should die shall we meet
With none but ghostly fathers in the street
Grief makes me rail sorrow will force its way
And showers of tears tempestuous sighs best lay 
The tongue may fail but overflowing eyes
Will weep out lasting streams of elegies
But thou O virgin-widow left alone
Now thy beloved heaven-ravish'd spouse is gone
Whose skilful sire in vain strove to apply
Medicines when thy balm was no remedy 
With greater than Platonic love O wed
His soul though not his body to thy bed
Let that make thee a mother bring thou forth
The ideas of his virtue knowledge worth 
Transcribe the original in new copies give
Hastings o' the better part so shall he live
In nobler half and the great grandsire be
Of an heroic divine progeny
An issue which to eternity shall last
Yet but the irradiations which he cast
Erect no mausoleums for his best
Monument is his spouse marble breast
And now 'tis time for their officious haste
Who would before have borne him to the sky
Like eager Romans ere all rites were past
Did let too soon the sacred eagle fly
 Though our best notes are treason to his fame
Join'd with the loud applause of public voice
Since Heaven what praise we offer to his name
Hath render'd too authentic by its choice
 Though in his praise no arts can liberal be
Since they whose muses have the highest flown
Add not to his immortal memory
But do an act of friendship to their own
 Yet 'tis our duty and our interest too
Such monuments as we can build to raise
Lest all the world prevent what we should do
And claim a title in him by their praise
 How shall I then begin or where conclude
To draw a fame so truly circular
For in a round what order can be show'd
Where all the parts so equal perfect are
 His grandeur he derived from Heaven alone
For he was great ere fortune made him so
And wars like mists that rise against the sun
Made him but greater seem not greater grow
 No borrow'd bays his temples did adorn
But to our crown he did fresh jewels bring
Nor was his virtue poison'd soon as born
With the too early thoughts of being king
 Fortune that easy mistress to the young
But to her ancient servants coy and hard
Him at that age her favourites rank'd among
When she her best-loved Pompey did discard
 He private mark'd the faults of others' sway
And set as sea-marks for himself to shun
Not like rash monarchs who their youth betray
By acts their age too late would wish undone
 And yet dominion was not his design
We owe that blessing not to him but Heaven
Which to fair acts unsought rewards did join
Rewards that less to him than us were given
 Our former chiefs like sticklers of the war
First sought to inflame the parties then to poise
The quarrel loved but did the cause abhor
And did not strike to hurt but make a noise
 War our consumption was their gainful trade
We inward bled whilst they prolong'd our pain
He fought to end our fighting and essay'd
To staunch the blood by breathing of the vein
 Swift and resistless through the land he past
Like that bold Greek who did the East subdue
And made to battles such heroic haste
As if on wings of victory he flew
 He fought secure of fortune as of fame
Still by new maps the island might be shown
Of conquests which he strew'd where'er he came
Thick as the galaxy with stars is sown
 His palms though under weights they did not stand
Still thrived no winter could his laurels fade
Heaven in his portrait show'd a workman hand
And drew it perfect yet without a shade
 Peace was the prize of all his toil and care
Which war had banish'd and did now restore
Bologna walls thus mounted in the air
To seat themselves more surely than before
 Her safety rescued Ireland to him owes
And treacherous Scotland to no interest true
Yet blest that fate which did his arms dispose
Her land to civilize as to subdue
 Nor was he like those stars which only shine
When to pale mariners they storms portend
He had his calmer influence and his mien
Did love and majesty together blend
 'Tis true his countenance did imprint an awe
And naturally all souls to his did bow
As wands of divination downward draw
And point to beds where sovereign gold doth grow
 When past all offerings to Feretrian Jove
He Mars deposed and arms to gowns made yield
Successful councils did him soon approve
As fit for close intrigues as open field
 To suppliant Holland he vouchsafed a peace
Our once bold rival of the British main
Now tamely glad her unjust claim to cease
And buy our friendship with her idol gain
 Fame of the asserted sea through Europe blown
Made France and Spain ambitious of his love
Each knew that side must conquer he would own
And for him fiercely as for empire strove
 No sooner was the Frenchman cause embraced
Than the light Monsieur the grave Don outweigh'd
His fortune turn'd the scale where'er 'twas cast
Though Indian mines were in the other laid
 When absent yet we conquer'd in his right
For though some meaner artist skill were shown
In mingling colours or in placing light
Yet still the fair designment was his own
 For from all tempers he could service draw
The worth of each with its alloy he knew
And as the confidant of Nature saw
How she complexions did divide and brew
 Or he their single virtues did survey
By intuition in his own large breast
Where all the rich ideas of them lay
That were the rule and measure to the rest
 When such heroic virtue Heaven sets out
The stars like commons sullenly obey
Because it drains them when it comes about
And therefore is a tax they seldom pay
 From this high spring our foreign conquests flow
Which yet more glorious triumphs do portend
Since their commencement to his arms they owe
If springs as high as fountains may ascend
 He made us freemen of the Continent
Whom Nature did like captives treat before
To nobler preys the English lion sent
And taught him first in Belgian walks to roar
 That old unquestion'd pirate of the land
Proud Rome with dread the fate of Dunkirk heard
And trembling wish'd behind more Alps to stand
Although an Alexander were her guard
 By his command we boldly cross'd the line
And bravely fought where southern stars arise
We traced the far-fetch'd gold unto the mine
And that which bribed our fathers made our prize
 Such was our prince yet own'd a soul above
The highest acts it could produce to show
Thus poor mechanic arts in public move
Whilst the deep secrets beyond practice go
 Nor died he when his ebbing fame went less
But when fresh laurels courted him to live
He seem'd but to prevent some new success
As if above what triumphs earth could give
 His latest victories still thickest came
As near the centre motion doth increase
Till he press'd down by his own weighty name
Did like the vestal under spoils decease
 But first the ocean as a tribute sent
The giant prince of all her watery herd
And the Isle when her protecting genius went
Upon his obsequies loud sighs conferr'd
 No civil broils have since his death arose
But faction now by habit does obey
And wars have that respect for his repose
As winds for halcyons when they breed at sea
 His ashes in a peaceful urn shall rest
His name a great example stands to show
How strangely high endeavours may be blest
Where piety and valour jointly go
Now with a general peace the world was blest
While ours a world divided from the rest
A dreadful quiet felt and worser far
Than arms a sullen interval of war
Thus when black clouds draw down the labouring skies
Ere yet abroad the winged thunder flies
An horrid stillness first invades the ear
And in that silence we the tempest fear
The ambitious Swede like restless billows tost
On this hand gaining what on that he lost 
Though in his life he blood and ruin breathed
To his now guideless kingdom peace bequeath'd
And Heaven that seem'd regardless of our fate
For France and Spain did miracles create
Such mortal quarrels to compose in peace
As nature bred and interest did increase
We sigh'd to hear the fair Iberian bride
Must grow a lily to the lily side
While our cross stars denied us Charles' bed
Whom our first flames and virgin love did wed 
For his long absence Church and State did groan
Madness the pulpit faction seized the throne
Experienced age in deep despair was lost
To see the rebel thrive the loyal cross'd
Youth that with joys had unacquainted been
Envied gray hairs that once good days had seen
We thought our sires not with their own content
Had ere we came to age our portion spent
Nor could our nobles hope their bold attempt 
Who ruin'd crowns would coronets exempt
For when by their designing leaders taught
To strike at power which for themselves they sought
The vulgar gull'd into rebellion arm'd
Their blood to action by the prize was warm'd
The sacred purple then and scarlet gown
Like sanguine dye to elephants was shown
Thus when the bold Typhoeus scaled the sky
And forced great Jove from his own Heaven to fly
What king what crown from treason reach is free
If Jove and Heaven can violated be 
The lesser gods that shared his prosperous state
All suffer'd in the exiled Thunderer fate
The rabble now such freedom did enjoy
As winds at sea that use it to destroy
Blind as the Cyclop and as wild as he
They own'd a lawless savage liberty
Like that our painted ancestors so prized
Ere empire arts their breasts had civilized
How great were then our Charles' woes who thus
Was forced to suffer for himself and us 
He tost by fate and hurried up and down
Heir to his father sorrows with his crown
Could taste no sweets of youth desired age
But found his life too true a pilgrimage
Unconquer'd yet in that forlorn estate
His manly courage overcame his fate
His wounds he took like Romans on his breast
Which by his virtue were with laurels drest
As souls reach Heaven while yet in bodies pent
So did he live above his banishment 
That sun which we beheld with cozen'd eyes
Within the water moved along the skies
How easy 'tis when destiny proves kind
With full-spread sails to run before the wind
But those that 'gainst stiff gales laveering go
Must be at once resolved and skilful too
He would not like soft Otho hope prevent
But stay'd and suffer'd fortune to repent
These virtues Galba in a stranger sought
And Piso to adopted empire brought 
How shall I then my doubtful thoughts express
That must his sufferings both regret and bless
For when his early valour Heaven had cross'd
And all at Worcester but the honour lost
Forced into exile from his rightful throne
He made all countries where he came his own
And viewing monarchs' secret arts of sway
A royal factor for his kingdoms lay
Thus banish'd David spent abroad his time
When to be God anointed was his crime 
And when restored made his proud neighbours rue
Those choice remarks he from his travels drew
Nor is he only by afflictions shown
To conquer other realms but rule his own
Recovering hardly what he lost before
His right endears it much his purchase more
Inured to suffer ere he came to reign
No rash procedure will his actions stain
To business ripen'd by digestive thought
His future rule is into method brought 
As they who first proportion understand
With easy practice reach a master hand
Well might the ancient poets then confer
On Night the honour'd name of Counsellor
Since struck with rays of prosperous fortune blind
We light alone in dark afflictions find
In such adversities to sceptre train'd
The name of Great his famous grandsire gain'd
Who yet a king alone in name and right
With hunger cold and angry Jove did fight 
Shock'd by a covenanting league vast powers
As holy and as catholic as ours
Till fortune fruitless spite had made it known
Her blows not shook but riveted his throne
Some lazy ages lost in sleep and ease
No action leave to busy chronicles
Such whose supine felicity but makes
In story chasms in epoch mistakes
O'er whom Time gently shakes his wings of down
Till with his silent sickle they are mown 
Such is not Charles' too too active age
Which govern'd by the wild distemper'd rage
Of some black star infecting all the skies
Made him at his own cost like Adam wise
Tremble ye nations which secure before
Laugh'd at those arms that 'gainst ourselves we bore
Roused by the lash of his own stubborn tail
Our lion now will foreign foes assail
With alga who the sacred altar strews
To all the sea-gods Charles an offering owes 
A bull to thee Portumnus shall be slain
A lamb to you ye Tempests of the main
For those loud storms that did against him roar
Have cast his shipwreck'd vessel on the shore
Yet as wise artists mix their colours so
That by degrees they from each other go
Black steals unheeded from the neighbouring white
Without offending the well-cozen'd sight
So on us stole our blessed change while we
The effect did feel but scarce the manner see 
Frosts that constrain the ground and birth deny
To flowers that in its womb expecting lie
Do seldom their usurping power withdraw
But raging floods pursue their hasty thaw
Our thaw was mild the cold not chased away
But lost in kindly heat of lengthen'd day
Heaven would no bargain for its blessings drive
But what we could not pay for freely give
The Prince of peace would like himself confer
A gift unhoped without the price of war 
Yet as he knew his blessing worth took care
That we should know it by repeated prayer
Which storm'd the skies and ravish'd Charles from thence
As heaven itself is took by violence
Booth forward valour only served to show
He durst that duty pay we all did owe
The attempt was fair but Heaven prefixed hour
Not come so like the watchful traveller
That by the moon mistaken light did rise
Lay down again and closed his weary eyes 
'Twas Monk whom Providence design'd to loose
Those real bonds false freedom did impose
The blessed saints that watch'd this turning scene
Did from their stars with joyful wonder lean
To see small clues draw vastest weights along
Not in their bulk but in their order strong
Thus pencils can by one slight touch restore
Smiles to that changed face that wept before
With ease such fond chimeras we pursue
As fancy frames for fancy to subdue 
But when ourselves to action we betake
It shuns the mint like gold that chemists make
How hard was then his task at once to be
What in the body natural we see
Man Architect distinctly did ordain
The charge of muscles nerves and of the brain
Through viewless conduits spirits to dispense
The springs of motion from the seat of sense
'Twas not the hasty product of a day
But the well-ripen'd fruit of wise delay 
He like a patient angler ere he strook
Would let him play a while upon the hook
Our healthful food the stomach labours thus
At first embracing what it straight doth crush
Wise leeches will not vain receipts obtrude
While growing pains pronounce the humours crude
Deaf to complaints they wait upon the ill
Till some safe crisis authorise their skill
Nor could his acts too close a vizard wear
To 'scape their eyes whom guilt had taught to fear 
And guard with caution that polluted nest
Whence Legion twice before was dispossess'd
Once sacred house which when they enter'd in
They thought the place could sanctify a sin
Like those that vainly hoped kind Heaven would wink
While to excess on martyrs' tombs they drink
And as devouter Turks first warn their souls
To part before they taste forbidden bowls
So these when their black crimes they went about
First timely charm'd their useless conscience out 
Religion name against itself was made
The shadow served the substance to invade
Like zealous missions they did care pretend
Of souls in show but made the gold their end
The incensed powers beheld with scorn from high
An heaven so far distant from the sky
Which durst with horses' hoofs that beat the ground
And martial brass belie the thunder sound
'Twas hence at length just vengeance thought it fit
To speed their ruin by their impious wit 
Thus Sforza cursed with a too fertile brain
Lost by his wiles the power his wit did gain
Henceforth their fougue must spend at lesser rate
Than in its flames to wrap a nation fate
Suffer'd to live they are like helots set
A virtuous shame within us to beget
For by example most we sinn'd before
And glass-like clearness mix'd with frailty bore
But since reform'd by what we did amiss
We by our sufferings learn to prize our bliss 
Like early lovers whose unpractised hearts
Were long the May-game of malicious arts
When once they find their jealousies were vain
With double heat renew their fires again
'Twas this produced the joy that hurried o'er
Such swarms of English to the neighbouring shore
To fetch that prize by which Batavia made
So rich amends for our impoverish'd trade
Oh had you seen from Schevelin barren shore
Crowded with troops and barren now no more 
Afflicted Holland to his farewell bring
True sorrow Holland to regret a king
While waiting him his royal fleet did ride
And willing winds to their lower'd sails denied
The wavering streamers flags and standard out
The merry seamen rude but cheerful shout
And last the cannon voice that shook the skies
And as it fares in sudden ecstasies
At once bereft us both of ears and eyes
The Naseby now no longer England shame 
But better to be lost in Charles' name
Like some unequal bride in nobler sheets
Receives her lord the joyful London meets
The princely York himself alone a freight
The Swiftsure groans beneath great Gloster weight
Secure as when the halcyon breeds with these
He that was born to drown might cross the seas
Heaven could not own a Providence and take
The wealth three nations ventured at a stake
The same indulgence Charles' voyage bless'd 
Which in his right had miracles confess'd
The winds that never moderation knew
Afraid to blow too much too faintly blew
Or out of breath with joy could not enlarge
Their straighten'd lungs or conscious of their charge
The British Amphitrite smooth and clear
In richer azure never did appear
Proud her returning prince to entertain
With the submitted fasces of the main
And welcome now great monarch to your own 
Behold the approaching cliffs of Albion
It is no longer motion cheats your view
As you meet it the land approacheth you
The land returns and in the white it wears
The marks of penitence and sorrow bears
But you whose goodness your descent doth show
Your heavenly parentage and earthly too
By that same mildness which your father crown
Before did ravish shall secure your own
Not tied to rules of policy you find 
Revenge less sweet than a forgiving mind
Thus when the Almighty would to Moses give
A sight of all he could behold and live
A voice before his entry did proclaim
Long-suffering goodness mercy in his name
Your power to justice doth submit your cause
Your goodness only is above the laws
Whose rigid letter while pronounced by you
Is softer made So winds that tempests brew
When through Arabian groves they take their flight 
Made wanton with rich odours lose their spite
And as those lees that trouble it refine
The agitated soul of generous wine
So tears of joy for your returning spilt
Work out and expiate our former guilt
Methinks I see those crowds on Dover strand
Who in their haste to welcome you to land
Choked up the beach with their still growing store
And made a wilder torrent on the shore
While spurr'd with eager thoughts of past delight 
Those who had seen you court a second sight
Preventing still your steps and making haste
To meet you often wheresoe'er you past
How shall I speak of that triumphant day
When you renew'd the expiring pomp of May
A month that owns an interest in your name
You and the flowers are its peculiar claim
That star that at your birth shone out so bright
It stain'd the duller sun meridian light
Did once again its potent fires renew 
Guiding our eyes to find and worship you
And now Time whiter series is begun
Which in soft centuries shall smoothly run
Those clouds that overcast your morn shall fly
Dispell'd to farthest corners of the sky
Our nation with united interest blest
Not now content to poise shall sway the rest
Abroad your empire shall no limits know
But like the sea in boundless circles flow
Your much-loved fleet shall with a wide command 
Besiege the petty monarchs of the land
And as old Time his offspring swallow'd down
Our ocean in its depths all seas shall drown
Their wealthy trade from pirates' rapine free
Our merchants shall no more adventurers be
Nor in the farthest East those dangers fear
Which humble Holland must dissemble here
Spain to your gift alone her Indies owes
For what the powerful takes not he bestows
And France that did an exile presence fear 
May justly apprehend you still too near
At home the hateful names of parties cease
And factious souls are wearied into peace
The discontented now are only they
Whose crimes before did your just cause betray
Of those your edicts some reclaim from sin
But most your life and blest example win
Oh happy prince whom Heaven hath taught the way
By paying vows to have more vows to pay
Oh happy age oh times like those alone 
By fate reserved for great Augustus' throne
When the joint growth of arms and arts foreshow
The world a monarch and that monarch you
 In thriving arts long time had Holland grown
Crouching at home and cruel when abroad
Scarce leaving us the means to claim our own
Our King they courted and our merchants awed
 Trade which like blood should circularly flow
Stopp'd in their channels found its freedom lost
Thither the wealth of all the world did go
And seem'd but shipwreck'd on so base a coast
 For them alone the heavens had kindly heat
In eastern quarries ripening precious dew
For them the Idumaean balm did sweat
And in hot Ceylon spicy forests grew
 The sun but seem'd the labourer of the year
Each waxing moon supplied her watery store
To swell those tides which from the line did bear
Their brimful vessels to the Belgian shore
 Thus mighty in her ships stood Carthage long
And swept the riches of the world from far
Yet stoop'd to Rome less wealthy but more strong
And this may prove our second Punic war
 What peace can be where both to one pretend
But they more diligent and we more strong
Or if a peace it soon must have an end
For they would grow too powerful were it long
 Behold two nations then engaged so far
That each seven years the fit must shake each land
Where France will side to weaken us by war
Who only can his vast designs withstand
 See how he feeds the Iberian with delays
To render us his timely friendship vain
And while his secret soul on Flanders preys
He rocks the cradle of the babe of Spain
 Such deep designs of empire does he lay
O'er them whose cause he seems to take in hand
And prudently would make them lords at sea
To whom with ease he can give laws by land
 This saw our King and long within his breast
His pensive counsels balanced to and fro
He grieved the land he freed should be oppress'd
And he less for it than usurpers do
 His generous mind the fair ideas drew
Of fame and honour which in dangers lay
Where wealth like fruit on precipices grew
Not to be gather'd but by birds of prey
 The loss and gain each fatally were great
And still his subjects call'd aloud for war
But peaceful kings o'er martial people set
Each other poise and counterbalance are
 He first survey'd the charge with careful eyes
Which none but mighty monarchs could maintain
Yet judged like vapours that from limbecks rise
It would in richer showers descend again
 At length resolved to assert the watery ball
He in himself did whole Armadoes bring
Him aged seamen might their master call
And choose for general were he not their king
 It seems as every ship their sovereign knows
His awful summons they so soon obey
So hear the scaly herd when Proteus blows
And so to pasture follow through the sea
 To see this fleet upon the ocean move
Angels drew wide the curtains of the skies
And heaven as if there wanted lights above
For tapers made two glaring comets rise
 Whether they unctuous exhalations are
Fired by the sun or seeming so alone
Or each some more remote and slippery star
Which loses footing when to mortals shown
 Or one that bright companion of the sun
Whose glorious aspect seal'd our new-born king
And now a round of greater years begun
New influence from his walks of light did bring
 Victorious York did first with famed success
To his known valour make the Dutch give place
Thus Heaven our monarch fortune did confess
Beginning conquest from his royal race
 But since it was decreed auspicious King
In Britain right that thou shouldst wed the main
Heaven as a gage would cast some precious thing
And therefore doom'd that Lawson should be slain
 Lawson amongst the foremost met his fate
Whom sea-green Sirens from the rocks lament
Thus as an offering for the Grecian state
He first was kill'd who first to battle went
 Their chief blown up in air not waves expired
To which his pride presumed to give the law
The Dutch confess'd Heaven present and retired
And all was Britain the wide ocean saw
 To nearest ports their shatter'd ships repair
Where by our dreadful cannon they lay awed
So reverently men quit the open air
When thunder speaks the angry gods abroad
 And now approach'd their fleet from India fraught
With all the riches of the rising sun
And precious sand from southern climates brought
The fatal regions where the war begun
 Like hunted castors conscious of their store
Their waylaid wealth to Norway coasts they bring
There first the north cold bosom spices bore
And winter brooded on the eastern spring
 By the rich scent we found our perfumed prey
Which flank'd with rocks did close in covert lie
And round about their murdering cannon lay
At once to threaten and invite the eye
 Fiercer than cannon and than rocks more hard
The English undertake the unequal war
Seven ships alone by which the port is barr'd
Besiege the Indies and all Denmark dare
 These fight like husbands but like lovers those
These fain would keep and those more fain enjoy
And to such height their frantic passion grows
That what both love both hazard to destroy
 Amidst whole heaps of spices lights a ball
And now their odours arm'd against them fly
Some preciously by shatter'd porcelain fall
And some by aromatic splinters die
 And though by tempests of the prize bereft
In Heaven inclemency some ease we find
Our foes we vanquish'd by our valour left
And only yielded to the seas and wind
 Nor wholly lost we so deserved a prey
For storms repenting part of it restored
Which as a tribute from the Baltic sea
The British ocean sent her mighty lord
 Go mortals now and vex yourselves in vain
For wealth which so uncertainly must come
When what was brought so far and with such pain
Was only kept to lose it nearer home
 The son who twice three months on th' ocean tost
Prepared to tell what he had pass'd before
Now sees in English ships the Holland coast
And parents' arms in vain stretch'd from the shore
 This careful husband had been long away
Whom his chaste wife and little children mourn
Who on their fingers learn'd to tell the day
On which their father promised to return
 Such are the proud designs of human kind
And so we suffer shipwreck every where
Alas what port can such a pilot find
Who in the night of fate must blindly steer
 The undistinguish'd seeds of good and ill
Heaven in his bosom from our knowledge hides
And draws them in contempt of human skill
Which oft for friends mistaken foes provides
 Let Munster prelate ever be accurst
In whom we seek the German faith in vain
Alas that he should teach the English first
That fraud and avarice in the Church could reign
 Happy who never trust a stranger will
Whose friendship in his interest understood
Since money given but tempts him to be ill
When power is too remote to make him good
 Till now alone the mighty nations strove
The rest at gaze without the lists did stand
And threatening France placed like a painted Jove
Kept idle thunder in his lifted hand
 That eunuch guardian of rich Holland trade
Who envies us what he wants power to enjoy
Whose noiseful valour does no foe invade
And weak assistance will his friends destroy
 Offended that we fought without his leave
He takes this time his secret hate to show
Which Charles does with a mind so calm receive
As one that neither seeks nor shuns his foe
 With France to aid the Dutch the Danes unite
France as their tyrant Denmark as their slave
But when with one three nations join to fight
They silently confess that one more brave
 Lewis had chased the English from his shore
But Charles the French as subjects does invite
Would Heaven for each some Solomon restore
Who by their mercy may decide their right
 Were subjects so but only by their choice
And not from birth did forced dominion take
Our prince alone would have the public voice
And all his neighbours' realms would deserts make
 He without fear a dangerous war pursues
Which without rashness he began before
As honour made him first the danger choose
So still he makes it good on virtue score
 The doubled charge his subjects' love supplies
Who in that bounty to themselves are kind
So glad Egyptians see their Nilus rise
And in his plenty their abundance find
 With equal power he does two chiefs create
Two such as each seem'd worthiest when alone
Each able to sustain a nation fate
Since both had found a greater in their own
 Both great in courage conduct and in fame
Yet neither envious of the other praise
Their duty faith and interest too the same
Like mighty partners equally they raise
 The prince long time had courted fortune love
But once possess'd did absolutely reign
Thus with their Amazons the heroes strove
And conquer'd first those beauties they would gain
 The Duke beheld like Scipio with disdain
That Carthage which he ruin'd rise once more
And shook aloft the fasces of the main
To fright those slaves with what they felt before
 Together to the watery camp they haste
Whom matrons passing to their children show
Infants' first vows for them to heaven are cast
And future people bless them as they go
 With them no riotous pomp nor Asian train
To infect a navy with their gaudy fears
To make slow fights and victories but vain
But war severely like itself appears
 Diffusive of themselves where'er they pass
They make that warmth in others they expect
Their valour works like bodies on a glass
And does its image on their men project
 Our fleet divides and straight the Dutch appear
In number and a famed commander bold
The narrow seas can scarce their navy bear
Or crowded vessels can their soldiers hold
 The Duke less numerous but in courage more
On wings of all the winds to combat flies
His murdering guns a loud defiance roar
And bloody crosses on his flag-staffs rise
 Both furl their sails and strip them for the fight
Their folded sheets dismiss the useless air
The Elean plains could boast no nobler sight
When struggling champions did their bodies bare
 Borne each by other in a distant line
The sea-built forts in dreadful order move
So vast the noise as if not fleets did join
But lands unfix'd and floating nations strove
 Now pass'd on either side they nimbly tack
Both strive to intercept and guide the wind
And in its eye more closely they come back
To finish all the deaths they left behind
 On high-raised decks the haughty Belgians ride
Beneath whose shade our humble frigates go
Such port the elephant bears and so defied
By the rhinoceros her unequal foe
 And as the build so different is the fight
Their mounting shot is on our sails design'd
Deep in their hulls our deadly bullets light
And through the yielding planks a passage find
 Our dreaded admiral from far they threat
Whose batter'd rigging their whole war receives
All bare like some old oak which tempests beat
He stands and sees below his scatter'd leaves
 Heroes of old when wounded shelter sought
But he who meets all danger with disdain
Even in their face his ship to anchor brought
And steeple-high stood propt upon the main
 At this excess of courage all amazed
The foremost of his foes awhile withdraw
With such respect in enter'd Rome they gazed
Who on high chairs the god-like fathers saw
 And now as where Patroclus' body lay
Here Trojan chiefs advanced and there the Greek
Ours o'er the Duke their pious wings display
And theirs the noblest spoils of Britain seek
 Meantime his busy mariners he hastes
His shatter'd sails with rigging to restore
And willing pines ascend his broken masts
Whose lofty heads rise higher than before
 Straight to the Dutch he turns his dreadful prow
More fierce the important quarrel to decide
Like swans in long array his vessels show
Whose crests advancing do the waves divide
 They charge recharge and all along the sea
They drive and squander the huge Belgian fleet
Berkeley alone who nearest danger lay
Did a like fate with lost Creusa meet
 The night comes on we eager to pursue
The combat still and they ashamed to leave
Till the last streaks of dying day withdrew
And doubtful moonlight did our rage deceive
 In the English fleet each ship resounds with joy
And loud applause of their great leader fame
In fiery dreams the Dutch they still destroy
And slumbering smile at the imagined flame
 Not so the Holland fleet who tired and done
Stretch'd on their decks like weary oxen lie
Faint sweats all down their mighty members run
Vast bulks which little souls but ill supply
 In dreams they fearful precipices tread
Or shipwreck'd labour to some distant shore
Or in dark churches walk among the dead
They wake with horror and dare sleep no more
 The morn they look on with unwilling eyes
Till from their main-top joyful news they hear
Of ships which by their mould bring new supplies
And in their colours Belgian lions bear
 Our watchful general had discern'd from far
This mighty succour which made glad the foe
He sigh'd but like a father of the war
His face spake hope while deep his sorrows flow
 His wounded men he first sends off to shore
Never till now unwilling to obey
They not their wounds but want of strength deplore
And think them happy who with him can stay
 Then to the rest Rejoice said he to-day
In you the fortune of Great Britain lies
Among so brave a people you are they
Whom Heaven has chose to fight for such a prize
 If number English courages could quell
We should at first have shunn'd not met our foes
Whose numerous sails the fearful only tell
Courage from hearts and not from numbers grows
 He said nor needed more to say with haste
To their known stations cheerfully they go
And all at once disdaining to be last
Solicit every gale to meet the foe
 Nor did the encouraged Belgians long delay
But bold in others not themselves they stood
So thick our navy scarce could steer their way
But seem'd to wander in a moving wood
 Our little fleet was now engaged so far
That like the sword-fish in the whale they fought
The combat only seem'd a civil war
Till through their bowels we our passage wrought
 Never had valour no not ours before
Done aught like this upon the land or main
Where not to be o'ercome was to do more
Than all the conquests former kings did gain
 The mighty ghosts of our great Harries rose
And armed Edwards look'd with anxious eyes
To see this fleet among unequal foes
By which fate promised them their Charles should rise
 Meantime the Belgians tack upon our rear
And raking chase-guns through our sterns they send
Close by their fire ships like jackals appear
Who on their lions for the prey attend
 Silent in smoke of cannon they come on
Such vapours once did fiery Cacus hide
In these the height of pleased revenge is shown
Who burn contented by another side
 Sometimes from fighting squadrons of each fleet
Deceived themselves or to preserve some friend
Two grappling AEtnas on the ocean meet
And English fires with Belgian flames contend
 Now at each tack our little fleet grows less
And like maim'd fowl swim lagging on the main
Their greater loss their numbers scarce confess
While they lose cheaper than the English gain
 Have you not seen when whistled from the fist
Some falcon stoops at what her eye design'd
And with her eagerness the quarry miss'd
Straight flies at check and clips it down the wind
 The dastard crow that to the wood made wing
And sees the groves no shelter can afford
With her loud caws her craven kind does bring
Who safe in numbers cuff the noble bird
 Among the Dutch thus Albemarle did fare
He could not conquer and disdain'd to fly
Past hope of safety 'twas his latest care
Like falling Caesar decently to die
 Yet pity did his manly spirit move
To see those perish who so well had fought
And generously with his despair he strove
Resolved to live till he their safety wrought
 Let other muses write his prosperous fate
Of conquer'd nations tell and kings restored
But mine shall sing of his eclipsed estate
Which like the sun more wonders does afford
 He drew his mighty frigates all before
On which the foe his fruitless force employs
His weak ones deep into his rear he bore
Remote from guns as sick men from the noise
 His fiery cannon did their passage guide
And following smoke obscured them from the foe
Thus Israel safe from the Egyptian pride
By flaming pillars and by clouds did go
 Elsewhere the Belgian force we did defeat
But here our courages did theirs subdue
So Xenophon once led that famed retreat
Which first the Asian empire overthrew
 The foe approach'd and one for his bold sin
Was sunk as he that touch'd the ark was slain
The wild waves master'd him and suck'd him in
And smiling eddies dimpled on the main
 This seen the rest at awful distance stood
As if they had been there as servants set
To stay or to go on as he thought good
And not pursue but wait on his retreat
 So Lybian huntsmen on some sandy plain
From shady coverts roused the lion chase
The kingly beast roars out with loud disdain
And slowly moves unknowing to give place
 But if some one approach to dare his force
He swings his tail and swiftly turns him round
With one paw seizes on his trembling horse
And with the other tears him to the ground
 Amidst these toils succeeds the balmy night
Now hissing waters the quench'd guns restore
And weary waves withdrawing from the fight
Lie lull'd and panting on the silent shore
 The moon shone clear on the becalmed flood
Where while her beams like glittering silver play
Upon the deck our careful general stood
And deeply mused on the succeeding day
 That happy sun said he will rise again
Who twice victorious did our navy see
And I alone must view him rise in vain
Without one ray of all his star for me
 Yet like an English general will I die
And all the ocean make my spacious grave
Women and cowards on the land may lie
The sea a tomb that proper for the brave
 Restless he pass'd the remnant of the night
Till the fresh air proclaimed the morning nigh
And burning ships the martyrs of the fight
With paler fires beheld the eastern sky
 But now his stores of ammunition spent
His naked valour is his only guard
Rare thunders are from his dumb cannon sent
And solitary guns are scarcely heard
 Thus far had fortune power here forced to stay
Nor longer durst with virtue be at strife
This as a ransom Albemarle did pay
For all the glories of so great a life
 For now brave Rupert from afar appears
Whose waving streamers the glad general knows
With full spread sails his eager navy steers
And every ship in swift proportion grows
 The anxious prince had heard the cannon long
And from that length of time dire omens drew
Of English overmatch'd and Dutch too strong
Who never fought three days but to pursue
 Then as an eagle who with pious care
Was beating widely on the wing for prey
To her now silent eyrie does repair
And finds her callow infants forced away
 Stung with her love she stoops upon the plain
The broken air loud whistling as she flies
She stops and listens and shoots forth again
And guides her pinions by her young ones' cries
 With such kind passion hastes the prince to fight
And spreads his flying canvas to the sound
Him whom no danger were he there could fright
Now absent every little noise can wound
 As in a drought the thirsty creatures cry
And gape upon the gather'd clouds for rain
And first the martlet meets it in the sky
And with wet wings joys all the feather'd train
 With such glad hearts did our despairing men
Salute the appearance of the prince fleet
And each ambitiously would claim the ken
That with first eyes did distant safety meet
 The Dutch who came like greedy hinds before
To reap the harvest their ripe ears did yield
Now look like those when rolling thunders roar
And sheets of lightning blast the standing field
 Full in the prince passage hills of sand
And dangerous flats in secret ambush lay
Where the false tides skim o'er the cover'd land
And seamen with dissembled depths betray
 The wily Dutch who like fallen angels fear'd
This new Messiah coming there did wait
And round the verge their braving vessels steer'd
To tempt his courage with so fair a bait
 But he unmoved contemns their idle threat
Secure of fame whene'er he please to fight
His cold experience tempers all his heat
And inbred worth doth boasting valour slight
 Heroic virtue did his actions guide
And he the substance not the appearance chose
To rescue one such friend he took more pride
Than to destroy whole thousands of such foes
 But when approach'd in strict embraces bound
Rupert and Albemarle together grow
He joys to have his friend in safety found
Which he to none but to that friend would owe
 The cheerful soldiers with new stores supplied
Now long to execute their spleenful will
And in revenge for those three days they tried
Wish one like Joshua when the sun stood still
 Thus reinforced against the adverse fleet
Still doubling ours brave Rupert leads the way
With the first blushes of the morn they meet
And bring night back upon the new-born day
 His presence soon blows up the kindling fight
And his loud guns speak thick like angry men
It seem'd as slaughter had been breathed all night
And Death new pointed his dull dart again
 The Dutch too well his mighty conduct knew
And matchless courage since the former fight
Whose navy like a stiff-stretch'd cord did show
Till he bore in and bent them into flight
 The wind he shares while half their fleet offends
His open side and high above him shows
Upon the rest at pleasure he descends
And doubly harm'd he double harms bestows
 Behind the general mends his weary pace
And sullenly to his revenge he sails
So glides some trodden serpent on the grass
And long behind his wounded volume trails
 The increasing sound is borne to either shore
And for their stakes the throwing nations fear
Their passions double with the cannons' roar
And with warm wishes each man combats there
 Plied thick and close as when the fight begun
Their huge unwieldy navy wastes away
So sicken waning moons too near the sun
And blunt their crescents on the edge of day
 And now reduced on equal terms to fight
Their ships like wasted patrimonies show
Where the thin scattering trees admit the light
And shun each other shadows as they grow
 The warlike prince had sever'd from the rest
Two giant ships the pride of all the main
Which with his one so vigorously he prest
And flew so home they could not rise again
 Already batter'd by his lee they lay
In rain upon the passing winds they call
The passing winds through their torn canvas play
And flagging sails on heartless sailors fall
 Their open'd sides receive a gloomy light
Dreadful as day let into shades below
Without grim Death rides barefaced in their sight
And urges entering billows as they flow
 When one dire shot the last they could supply
Close by the board the prince mainmast bore
All three now helpless by each other lie
And this offends not and those fear no more
 So have I seen some fearful hare maintain
A course till tired before the dog she lay
Who stretch'd behind her pants upon the plain
Past power to kill as she to get away
 With his loll'd tongue he faintly licks his prey
His warm breath blows her flix up as she lies
She trembling creeps upon the ground away
And looks back to him with beseeching eyes
 The prince unjustly does his stars accuse
Which hinder'd him to push his fortune on
For what they to his courage did refuse
By mortal valour never must be done
 This lucky hour the wise Batavian takes
And warns his tatter'd fleet to follow home
Proud to have so got off with equal stakes
Where 'twas a triumph not to be o'ercome
 The general force as kept alive by fight
Now not opposed no longer can pursue
Lasting till heaven had done his courage right
When he had conquer'd he his weakness knew
 He casts a frown on the departing foe
And sighs to see him quit the watery field
His stern fix'd eyes no satisfaction show
For all the glories which the fight did yield
 Though as when fiends did miracles avow
He stands confess'd e'en by the boastful Dutch
He only does his conquest disavow
And thinks too little what they found too much
 Return'd he with the fleet resolved to stay
No tender thoughts of home his heart divide
Domestic joys and cares he puts away
For realms are households which the great must guide
 As those who unripe veins in mines explore
On the rich bed again the warm turf lay
Till time digests the yet imperfect ore
And know it will be gold another day
 So looks our monarch on this early fight
Th' essay and rudiments of great success
Which all-maturing time must bring to light
While he like Heaven does each day labour bless
 Heaven ended not the first or second day
Yet each was perfect to the work design'd
God and king work when they their work survey
A passive aptness in all subjects find
 In burden'd vessels first with speedy care
His plenteous stores do seasoned timber send
Thither the brawny carpenters repair
And as the surgeons of maim'd ships attend
 With cord and canvas from rich Hamburgh sent
His navy molted wings he imps once more
Tall Norway fir their masts in battle spent
And English oak sprung leaks and planks restore
 All hands employ'd the royal work grows warm
Like labouring bees on a long summer day
Some sound the trumpet for the rest to swarm
And some on bells of tasted lilies play
 With gluey wax some new foundations lay
Of virgin-combs which from the roof are hung
Some arm'd within doors upon duty stay
Or tend the sick or educate the young
 So here some pick out bullets from the sides
Some drive old oakum through each seam and rift
Their left hand does the calking-iron guide
The rattling mallet with the right they lift
 With boiling pitch another near at hand
From friendly Sweden brought the seams instops
Which well paid o'er the salt sea waves withstand
And shakes them from the rising beak in drops
 Some the gall'd ropes with dauby marline bind
Or sear-cloth masts with strong tarpaulin coats
To try new shrouds one mounts into the wind
And one below their ease or stiffness notes
 Our careful monarch stands in person by
His new-cast cannons' firmness to explore
The strength of big-corn'd powder loves to try
And ball and cartridge sorts for every bore
 Each day brings fresh supplies of arms and men
And ships which all last winter were abroad
And such as fitted since the fight had been
Or new from stocks were fallen into the road
 The goodly London in her gallant trim
The Phoenix daughter of the vanish'd old
Like a rich bride does to the ocean swim
And on her shadow rides in floating gold
 Her flag aloft spread ruffling to the wind
And sanguine streamers seem the flood to fire
The weaver charm'd with what his loom design'd
Goes on to sea and knows not to retire
 With roomy decks her guns of mighty strength
Whose low-laid mouths each mounting billow laves
Deep in her draught and warlike in her length
She seems a sea-wasp flying on the waves
 This martial present piously design'd
The loyal city give their best-loved King
And with a bounty ample as the wind
Built fitted and maintain'd to aid him bring
 By viewing Nature Nature handmaid Art
Makes mighty things from small beginnings grow
Thus fishes first to shipping did impart
Their tail the rudder and their head the prow
 Some log perhaps upon the waters swam
An useless drift which rudely cut within
And hollow'd first a floating trough became
And cross some rivulet passage did begin
 In shipping such as this the Irish kern
And untaught Indian on the stream did glide
Ere sharp-keel'd boats to stem the flood did learn
Or fin-like oars did spread from either side
 Add but a sail and Saturn so appear'd
When from lost empire he to exile went
And with the golden age to Tiber steer'd
Where coin and commerce first he did invent
 Rude as their ships was navigation then
No useful compass or meridian known
Coasting they kept the land within their ken
And knew no North but when the Pole-star shone
 Of all who since have used the open sea
Than the bold English none more fame have won
Beyond the year and out of heaven high way
They make discoveries where they see no sun
 But what so long in vain and yet unknown
By poor mankind benighted wit is sought
Shall in this age to Britain first be shown
And hence be to admiring nations taught
 The ebbs of tides and their mysterious flow
We as art elements shall understand
And as by line upon the ocean go
Whose paths shall be familiar as the land
 Instructed ships shall sail to quick commerce
By which remotest regions are allied
Which makes one city of the universe
Where some may gain and all may be supplied
 Then we upon our globe last verge shall go
And view the ocean leaning on the sky
From thence our rolling neighbours we shall know
And on the lunar world securely pry
 This I foretell from your auspicious care
Who great in search of God and nature grow
Who best your wise Creator praise declare
Since best to praise his works is best to know
 O truly royal who behold the law
And rule of beings in your Maker mind
And thence like limbecks rich ideas draw
To fit the levell'd use of human-kind
 But first the toils of war we must endure
And from the injurious Dutch redeem the seas
War makes the valiant of his right secure
And gives up fraud to be chastised with ease
 Already were the Belgians on our coast
Whose fleet more mighty every day became
By late success which they did falsely boast
And now by first appearing seem'd to claim
 Designing subtle diligent and close
They knew to manage war with wise delay
Yet all those arts their vanity did cross
And by their pride their prudence did betray
 Nor stay'd the English long but well supplied
Appear as numerous as the insulting foe
The combat now by courage must be tried
And the success the braver nation show
 There was the Plymouth squadron now come in
Which in the Straits last winter was abroad
Which twice on Biscay working bay had been
And on the midland sea the French had awed
 Old expert Allen loyal all along
Famed for his action on the Smyrna fleet
And Holmes whose name shall live in epic song
While music numbers or while verse has feet
 Holmes the Achates of the general fight
Who first bewitch'd our eyes with Guinea gold
As once old Cato in the Roman sight
The tempting fruits of Afric did unfold
 With him went Spragge as bountiful as brave
Whom his high courage to command had brought
Harman who did the twice-fired Harry save
And in his burning ship undaunted fought
 Young Hollis on a Muse by Mars begot
Born Caesar-like to write and act great deeds
Impatient to revenge his fatal shot
His right hand doubly to his left succeeds
 Thousands were there in darker fame that dwell
Whose deeds some nobler poem shall adorn
And though to me unknown they sure fought well
Whom Rupert led and who were British born
 Of every size an hundred fighting sail
So vast the navy now at anchor rides
That underneath it the press'd waters fail
And with its weight it shoulders off the tides
 Now anchors weigh'd the seamen shout so shrill
That heaven and earth and the wide ocean rings
A breeze from westward waits their sails to fill
And rests in those high beds his downy wings
 The wary Dutch this gathering storm foresaw
And durst not bide it on the English coast
Behind their treacherous shallows they withdraw
And there lay snares to catch the British host
 So the false spider when her nets are spread
Deep ambush'd in her silent den does lie
And feels far off the trembling of her thread
Whose filmy cord should bind the struggling fly
 Then if at last she find him fast beset
She issues forth and runs along her loom
She joys to touch the captive in her net
And drags the little wretch in triumph home
 The Belgians hoped that with disorder'd haste
Our deep-cut keels upon the sands might run
Or if with caution leisurely were past
Their numerous gross might charge us one by one
 But with a fore-wind pushing them above
And swelling tide that heaved them from below
O'er the blind flats our warlike squadrons move
And with spread sails to welcome battle go
 It seem'd as there the British Neptune stood
With all his hosts of waters at command
Beneath them to submit the officious flood
And with his trident shoved them off the sand
 To the pale foes they suddenly draw near
And summon them to unexpected fight
They start like murderers when ghosts appear
And draw their curtains in the dead of night
 Now van to van the foremost squadrons meet
The midmost battles hastening up behind
Who view far off the storm of falling sleet
And hear their thunder rattling in the wind
 At length the adverse admirals appear
The two bold champions of each country right
Their eyes describe the lists as they come near
And draw the lines of death before they fight
 The distance judged for shot of every size
The linstocks touch the ponderous ball expires
The vigorous seaman every port-hole plies
And adds his heart to every gun he fires
 Fierce was the fight on the proud Belgians' side
For honour which they seldom sought before
But now they by their own vain boasts were tied
And forced at least in show to prize it more
 But sharp remembrance on the English part
And shame of being match'd by such a foe
Rouse conscious virtue up in every heart
And seeming to be stronger makes them so
 Nor long the Belgians could that fleet sustain
Which did two generals' fates and Caesar bear
Each several ship a victory did gain
As Rupert or as Albemarle were there
 Their batter'd admiral too soon withdrew
Unthank'd by ours for his unfinish'd fight
But he the minds of his Dutch masters knew
Who call'd that Providence which we call'd flight
 Never did men more joyfully obey
Or sooner understood the sign to fly
With such alacrity they bore away
As if to praise them all the States stood by
 O famous leader of the Belgian fleet
Thy monument inscribed such praise shall wear
As Varro timely flying once did meet
Because he did not of his Rome despair
 Behold that navy which a while before
Provoked the tardy English close to fight
Now draw their beaten vessels close to shore
As larks lie dared to shun the hobby flight
 Whoe'er would English monuments survey
In other records may our courage know
But let them hide the story of this day
Whose fame was blemish'd by too base a foe
 Or if too busily they will inquire
Into a victory which we disdain
Then let them know the Belgians did retire
Before the patron saint of injured Spain
 Repenting England this revengeful day
To Philip manes did an offering bring
England which first by leading them astray
Hatch'd up rebellion to destroy her King
 Our fathers bent their baneful industry
To check a monarchy that slowly grew
But did not France or Holland fate foresee
Whose rising power to swift dominion flew
 In fortune empire blindly thus we go
And wander after pathless destiny
Whose dark resorts since prudence cannot know
In vain it would provide for what shall be
 But whate'er English to the bless'd shall go
And the fourth Harry or first Orange meet
Find him disowning of a Bourbon foe
And him detesting a Batavian fleet
 Now on their coasts our conquering navy rides
Waylays their merchants and their land besets
Each day new wealth without their care provides
They lie asleep with prizes in their nets
 So close behind some promontory lie
The huge leviathans to attend their prey
And give no chase but swallow in the fry
Which through their gaping jaws mistake the way
 Nor was this all in ports and roads remote
Destructive fires among whole fleets we send
Triumphant flames upon the water float
And out-bound ships at home their voyage end
 Those various squadrons variously design'd
Each vessel freighted with a several load
Each squadron waiting for a several wind
All find but one to burn them in the road
 Some bound for Guinea golden sand to find
Bore all the gauds the simple natives wear
Some for the pride of Turkish courts design'd
For folded turbans finest Holland bear
 Some English wool vex'd in a Belgian loom
And into cloth of spungy softness made
Did into France or colder Denmark doom
To ruin with worse ware our staple trade
 Our greedy seamen rummage every hold
Smile on the booty of each wealthier chest
And as the priests who with their gods make bold
Take what they like and sacrifice the rest
 But ah how insincere are all our joys
Which sent from heaven like lightning make no stay
Their palling taste the journey length destroys
Or grief sent post o'ertakes them on the way
 Swell'd with our late successes on the foe
Which France and Holland wanted power to cross
We urge an unseen fate to lay us low
And feed their envious eyes with English loss
 Each element His dread command obeys
Who makes or ruins with a smile or frown
Who as by one he did our nation raise
So now he with another pulls us down
 Yet London empress of the northern clime
By an high fate thou greatly didst expire
Great as the world which at the death of time
Must fall and rise a nobler frame by fire
 As when some dire usurper Heaven provides
To scourge his country with a lawless sway
His birth perhaps some petty village hides
And sets his cradle out of fortune way
 Till fully ripe his swelling fate breaks out
And hurries him to mighty mischiefs on
His prince surprised at first no ill could doubt
And wants the power to meet it when 'tis known
 Such was the rise of this prodigious fire
Which in mean buildings first obscurely bred
From thence did soon to open streets aspire
And straight to palaces and temples spread
 The diligence of trades and noiseful gain
And luxury more late asleep were laid
All was the night and in her silent reign
No sound the rest of nature did invade
 In this deep quiet from what source unknown
Those seeds of fire their fatal birth disclose
And first few scattering sparks about were blown
Big with the flames that to our ruin rose
 Then in some close-pent room it crept along
And smouldering as it went in silence fed
Till the infant monster with devouring strong
Walk'd boldly upright with exalted head
 Now like some rich or mighty murderer
Too great for prison which he breaks with gold
Who fresher for new mischiefs does appear
And dares the world to tax him with the old
 So 'scapes the insulting fire his narrow jail
And makes small outlets into open air
There the fierce winds his tender force assail
And beat him downward to his first repair
 The winds like crafty courtesans withheld
His flames from burning but to blow them more
And every fresh attempt he is repell'd
With faint denials weaker than before
 And now no longer letted of his prey
He leaps up at it with enraged desire
O'erlooks the neighbours with a wide survey
And nods at every house his threatening fire
 The ghosts of traitors from the bridge descend
With bold fanatic spectres to rejoice
About the fire into a dance they bend
And sing their sabbath notes with feeble voice
 Our guardian angel saw them where they sate
Above the palace of our slumbering king
He sigh'd abandoning his charge to fate
And drooping oft look'd back upon the wing
 At length the crackling noise and dreadful blaze
Call'd up some waking lover to the sight
And long it was ere he the rest could raise
Whose heavy eyelids yet were full of night
 The next to danger hot pursued by fate
Half-clothed half-naked hastily retire
And frighted mothers strike their breasts too late
For helpless infants left amidst the fire
 Their cries soon waken all the dwellers near
Now murmuring noises rise in every street
The more remote run stumbling with their fear
And in the dark men jostle as they meet
 So weary bees in little cells repose
But if night-robbers lift the well-stored hive
An humming through their waxen city grows
And out upon each other wings they drive
 Now streets grow throng'd and busy as by day
Some run for buckets to the hallow'd quire
Some cut the pipes and some the engines play
And some more bold mount ladders to the fire
 In vain for from the east a Belgian wind
His hostile breath through the dry rafters sent
The flames impell'd soon left their foes behind
And forward with a wanton fury went
 A quay of fire ran all along the shore
And lighten'd all the river with a blaze
The waken'd tides began again to roar
And wondering fish in shining waters gaze
 Old father Thames raised up his reverend head
But fear'd the fate of Simois would return
Deep in his ooze he sought his sedgy bed
And shrunk his waters back into his urn
 The fire meantime walks in a broader gross
To either hand his wings he opens wide
He wades the streets and straight he reaches cross
And plays his longing flames on the other side
 At first they warm then scorch and then they take
Now with long necks from side to side they feed
At length grown strong their mother-fire forsake
And a new colony of flames succeed
 To every nobler portion of the town
The curling billows roll their restless tide
In parties now they straggle up and down
As armies unopposed for prey divide
 One mighty squadron with a side-wind sped
Through narrow lanes his cumber'd fire does haste
By powerful charms of gold and silver led
The Lombard bankers and the 'Change to waste
 Another backward to the Tower would go
And slowly eats his way against the wind
But the main body of the marching foe
Against the imperial palace is design'd
 Now day appears and with the day the King
Whose early care had robb'd him of his rest
Far off the cracks of falling houses ring
And shrieks of subjects pierce his tender breast
 Near as he draws thick harbingers of smoke
With gloomy pillars cover all the place
Whose little intervals of night are broke
By sparks that drive against his sacred face
 More than his guards his sorrows made him known
And pious tears which down his cheeks did shower
The wretched in his grief forgot their own
So much the pity of a king has power
 He wept the flames of what he loved so well
And what so well had merited his love
For never prince in grace did more excel
Or royal city more in duty strove
 Nor with an idle care did he behold
Subjects may grieve but monarchs must redress
He cheers the fearful and commends the bold
And makes despairers hope for good success
 Himself directs what first is to be done
And orders all the succours which they bring
The helpful and the good about him run
And form an army worthy such a king
 He sees the dire contagion spread so fast
That where it seizes all relief is vain
And therefore must unwillingly lay waste
That country which would else the foe maintain
 The powder blows up all before the fire
The amazed flames stand gather'd on a heap
And from the precipice brink retire
Afraid to venture on so large a leap
 Thus fighting fires a while themselves consume
But straight like Turks forced on to win or die
They first lay tender bridges of their fume
And o'er the breach in unctuous vapours fly
 Part stay for passage till a gust of wind
Ships o'er their forces in a shining sheet
Part creeping under ground their journey blind
And climbing from below their fellows meet
 Thus to some desert plain or old woodside
Dire night-hags come from far to dance their round
And o'er broad rivers on their fiends they ride
Or sweep in clouds above the blasted ground
 No help avails for hydra-like the fire
Lifts up his hundred heads to aim his way
And scarce the wealthy can one half retire
Before he rushes in to share the prey
 The rich grow suppliant and the poor grow proud
Those offer mighty gain and these ask more
So void of pity is the ignoble crowd
When others' ruin may increase their store
 As those who live by shores with joy behold
Some wealthy vessel split or stranded nigh
And from the rocks leap down for shipwreck'd gold
And seek the tempests which the others fly
 So these but wait the owners' last despair
And what permitted to the flames invade
Even from their jaws they hungry morsels tear
And on their backs the spoils of Vulcan lade
 The days were all in this lost labour spent
And when the weary king gave place to night
His beams he to his royal brother lent
And so shone still in his reflective light
 Night came but without darkness or repose 
A dismal picture of the general doom
Where souls distracted when the trumpet blows
And half unready with their bodies come
 Those who have homes when home they do repair
To a last lodging call their wandering friends
Their short uneasy sleeps are broke with care
To look how near their own destruction tends
 Those who have none sit round where once it was
And with full eyes each wonted room require
Haunting the yet warm ashes of the place
As murder'd men walk where they did expire
 Some stir up coals and watch the vestal fire
Others in vain from sight of ruin run
And while through burning labyrinths they retire
With loathing eyes repeat what they would shun
 The most in fields like herded beasts lie down
To dews obnoxious on the grassy floor
And while their babes in sleep their sorrows drown
Sad parents watch the remnants of their store
 While by the motion of the flames they guess
What streets are burning now and what are near
An infant waking to the paps would press
And meets instead of milk a falling tear
 No thought can ease them but their sovereign care
Whose praise the afflicted as their comfort sing
Even those whom want might drive to just despair
Think life a blessing under such a king
 Meantime he sadly suffers in their grief
Out-weeps an hermit and out-prays a saint
All the long night he studies their relief
How they may be supplied and he may want
 O God said he thou patron of my days
Guide of my youth in exile and distress
Who me unfriended brought'st by wondrous ways
The kingdom of my fathers to possess
 Be thou my judge with what unwearied care
I since have labour'd for my people good
To bind the bruises of a civil war
And stop the issues of their wasting blood
 Thou who hast taught me to forgive the ill
And recompense as friends the good misled
If mercy be a precept of thy will
Return that mercy on thy servant head
 Or if my heedless youth has stepp'd astray
Too soon forgetful of thy gracious hand
On me alone thy just displeasure lay
But take thy judgments from this mourning land
 We all have sinn'd and thou hast laid us low
As humble earth from whence at first we came
Like flying shades before the clouds we show
And shrink like parchment in consuming flame
 O let it be enough what thou hast done
When spotted Deaths ran arm'd through every street
With poison'd darts which not the good could shun
The speedy could out-fly or valiant meet
 The living few and frequent funerals then
Proclaim'd thy wrath on this forsaken place
And now those few who are return'd again
Thy searching judgments to their dwellings trace
 O pass not Lord an absolute decree
Or bind thy sentence unconditional
But in thy sentence our remorse foresee
And in that foresight this thy doom recall
 Thy threatenings Lord as thine thou mayst revoke
But if immutable and fix'd they stand
Continue still thyself to give the stroke
And let not foreign foes oppress thy land
 The Eternal heard and from the heavenly quire
Chose out the cherub with the flaming sword
And bade him swiftly drive the approaching fire
From where our naval magazines were stored
 The blessed minister his wings display'd
And like a shooting star he cleft the night
He charged the flames and those that disobey'd
He lash'd to duty with his sword of light
 The fugitive flames chastised went forth to prey
On pious structures by our fathers rear'd
By which to heaven they did affect the way
Ere faith in churchmen without works was heard
 The wanting orphans saw with watery eyes
Their founder charity in dust laid low
And sent to God their ever-answered cries
For He protects the poor who made them so
 Nor could thy fabric Paul defend thee long
Though thou wert sacred to thy Maker praise
Though made immortal by a poet song
And poets' songs the Theban walls could raise
 The daring flames peep'd in and saw from far
The awful beauties of the sacred quire
But since it was profaned by civil war
Heaven thought it fit to have it purged by fire
 Now down the narrow streets it swiftly came
And widely opening did on both sides prey
This benefit we sadly owe the flame
If only ruin must enlarge our way
 And now four days the sun had seen our woes
Four nights the moon beheld the incessant fire
It seem'd as if the stars more sickly rose
And farther from the feverish north retire
 In th' empyrean heaven the bless'd abode
The Thrones and the Dominions prostrate lie
Not daring to behold their angry God
And a hush'd silence damps the tuneful sky
 At length the Almighty cast a pitying eye
And mercy softly touch'd his melting breast
He saw the town one half in rubbish lie
And eager flames drive on to storm the rest
 An hollow crystal pyramid he takes
In firmamental waters dipt above
Of it a broad extinguisher he makes
And hoods the flames that to their quarry drove
 The vanquish'd fires withdraw from every place
Or full with feeding sink into a sleep
Each household genius shows again his face
And from the hearths the little Lares creep
 Our King this more than natural change beholds
With sober joy his heart and eyes abound
To the All-good his lifted hands he folds
And thanks him low on his redeemed ground
 As when sharp frosts had long constrain'd the earth
A kindly thaw unlocks it with mild rain
And first the tender blade peeps up to birth
And straight the green fields laugh with promised grain
 By such degrees the spreading gladness grew
In every heart which fear had froze before
The standing streets with so much joy they view
That with less grief the perish'd they deplore
 The father of the people open'd wide
His stores and all the poor with plenty fed
Thus God anointed God own place supplied
And fill'd the empty with his daily bread
 This royal bounty brought its own reward
And in their minds so deep did print the sense
That if their ruins sadly they regard
'Tis but with fear the sight might drive him thence
 But so may he live long that town to sway
Which by his auspice they will nobler make
As he will hatch their ashes by his stay
And not their humble ruins now forsake
 They have not lost their loyalty by fire
Nor is their courage or their wealth so low
That from his wars they poorly would retire
Or beg the pity of a vanquish'd foe
 Not with more constancy the Jews of old
By Cyrus from rewarded exile sent
Their royal city did in dust behold
Or with more vigour to rebuild it went
 The utmost malice of their stars is past
And two dire comets which have scourged the town
In their own plague and fire have breathed the last
Or dimly in their sinking sockets frown
 Now frequent trines the happier lights among
And high-raised Jove from his dark prison freed
Those weights took off that on his planet hung
Will gloriously the new-laid work succeed
 Methinks already from this chemic flame
I see a city of more precious mould
Rich as the town which gives the Indies name
With silver paved and all divine with gold
 Already labouring with a mighty fate
She shakes the rubbish from her mounting brow
And seems to have renew'd her charter date
Which Heaven will to the death of time allow
 More great than human now and more august
Now deified she from her fires does rise
Her widening streets on new foundations trust
And opening into larger parts she flies
 Before she like some shepherdess did show
Who sat to bathe her by a river side
Not answering to her fame but rude and low
Nor taught the beauteous arts of modern pride
 Now like a maiden queen she will behold
From her high turrets hourly suitors come
The East with incense and the West with gold
Will stand like suppliants to receive her doom
 The silver Thames her own domestic flood
Shall bear her vessels like a sweeping train
And often wind as of his mistress proud
With longing eyes to meet her face again
 The wealthy Tagus and the wealthier Rhine
The glory of their towns no more shall boast
And Seine that would with Belgian rivers join
Shall find her lustre stain'd and traffic lost
 The venturous merchant who design'd more far
And touches on our hospitable shore
Charm'd with the splendour of this northern star
Shall here unlade him and depart no more
 Our powerful navy shall no longer meet
The wealth of France or Holland to invade
The beauty of this town without a fleet
From all the world shall vindicate her trade
 And while this famed emporium we prepare
The British ocean shall such triumphs boast
That those who now disdain our trade to share
Shall rob like pirates on our wealthy coast
 Already we have conquer'd half the war
And the less dangerous part is left behind
Our trouble now is but to make them dare
And not so great to vanquish as to find
 Thus to the Eastern wealth through storms we go
But now the Cape once doubled fear no more
A constant trade-wind will securely blow
And gently lay us on the spicy shore
How dull and how insensible a beast
Is man who yet would lord it o'er the rest
Philosophers and poets vainly strove
In every age the lumpish mass to move
But those were pedants when compared with these
Who know not only to instruct but please
Poets alone found the delightful way
Mysterious morals gently to convey
In charming numbers so that as men grew
Pleased with their poems they grew wiser too 
Satire has always shone among the rest
And is the boldest way if not the best
To tell men freely of their foulest faults
To laugh at their vain deeds and vainer thoughts
In satire too the wise took different ways
To each deserving its peculiar praise
Some did all folly with just sharpness blame
Whilst others laugh'd and scorn'd them into shame
But of these two the last succeeded best
As men aim rightest when they shoot in jest 
Yet if we may presume to blame our guides
And censure those who censure all besides
In other things they justly are preferr'd
In this alone methinks the ancients err'd 
Against the grossest follies they declaim
Hard they pursue but hunt ignoble game
Nothing is easier than such blots to hit
And 'tis the talent of each vulgar wit
Besides 'tis labour lost for who would preach
Morals to Armstrong or dull Aston teach 
'Tis being devout at play wise at a ball
Or bringing wit and friendship to Whitehall
But with sharp eyes those nicer faults to find
Which lie obscurely in the wisest mind
That little speck which all the rest does spoil
To wash off that would be a noble toil
Beyond the loose writ libels of this age
Or the forced scenes of our declining stage
Above all censure too each little wit
Will be so glad to see the greater hit 
Who judging better though concern'd the most
Of such correction will have cause to boast
In such a satire all would seek a share
And every fool will fancy he is there
Old story-tellers too must pine and die
To see their antiquated wit laid by
Like her who miss'd her name in a lampoon
And grieved to find herself decay'd so soon
No common coxcomb must be mentioned here
Not the dull train of dancing sparks appear 
Nor fluttering officers who never fight
Of such a wretched rabble who would write
Much less half wits that more against our rules
For they are fops the other are but fools
Who would not be as silly as Dunbar
As dull as Monmouth rather than Sir Carr
The cunning courtier should be slighted too
Who with dull knavery makes so much ado
Till the shrewd fool by thriving too too fast
Like AEsop fox becomes a prey at last 
Nor shall the royal mistresses be named
Too ugly or too easy to be blamed
With whom each rhyming fool keeps such a pother
They are as common that way as the other
Yet sauntering Charles between his beastly brace
Meets with dissembling still in either place
Affected humour or a painted face
In loyal libels we have often told him
How one has jilted him the other sold him
How that affects to laugh how this to weep 
But who can rail so long as he can sleep
Was ever prince by two at once misled
False foolish old ill-natured and ill-bred
Earnely and Aylesbury with all that race
Of busy blockheads shall have here no place
At council set as foils on Danby score
To make that great false jewel shine the more
Who all that while was thought exceeding wise
Only for taking pains and telling lies
But there no meddling with such nauseous men 
Their very names have tired my lazy pen
'Tis time to quit their company and choose
Some fitter subject for sharper muse
First let behold the merriest man alive
Against his careless genius vainly strive
Quit his dear ease some deep design to lay
'Gainst a set time and then forget the day
Yet he will laugh at his best friends and be
Just as good company as Nokes and Lee
But when he aims at reason or at rule 
He turns himself the best to ridicule
Let him at business ne'er so earnest sit
Show him but mirth and bait that mirth with wit
That shadow of a jest shall be enjoy'd
Though he left all mankind to be destroy'd
So cat transform'd sat gravely and demure
Till mouse appear'd and thought himself secure
But soon the lady had him in her eye
And from her friend did just as oddly fly
Reaching above our nature does no good 
We must fall back to our old flesh and blood
As by our little Machiavel we find
That nimblest creature of the busy kind
His limbs are crippled and his body shakes
Yet his hard mind which all this bustle makes
No pity of its poor companion takes
What gravity can hold from laughing out
To see him drag his feeble legs about
Like hounds ill-coupled Jowler lugs him still
Through hedges ditches and through all that ill 
'Twere crime in any man but him alone
To use a body so though 'tis one own
Yet this false comfort never gives him o'er
That whilst he creeps his vigorous thoughts can soar
Alas that soaring to those few that know
Is but a busy grovelling here below
So men in rapture think they mount the sky
Whilst on the ground the entranced wretches lie
So modern fops have fancied they could fly
As the new earl with parts deserving praise 
And wit enough to laugh at his own ways
Yet loses all soft days and sensual nights
Kind nature checks and kinder fortune slights
Striving against his quiet all he can
For the fine notion of a busy man
And what is that at best but one whose mind
Is made to tire himself and all mankind
For Ireland he would go faith let him reign
For if some odd fantastic lord would fain
Carry in trunks and all my drudgery do 
I'll not only pay him but admire him too
But is there any other beast that lives
Who his own harm so wittingly contrives
Will any dog that has his teeth and stones
Refinedly leave his bitches and his bones
To turn a wheel and bark to be employ'd
While Venus is by rival dogs enjoy'd
Yet this fond man to get a statesman name
Forfeits his friends his freedom and his fame
Though satire nicely writ with humour stings 
But those who merit praise in other things
Yet we must needs this one exception make
And break our rules for silly Tropos' sake
Who was too much despised to be accused
And therefore scarce deserves to be abused
Raised only by his mercenary tongue
For railing smoothly and for reasoning wrong
As boys on holidays let loose to play
Lay waggish traps for girls that pass that way
Then shout to see in dirt and deep distress 
Some silly cit in her flower'd foolish dress
So have I mighty satisfaction found
To see his tinsel reason on the ground
To see the florid fool despised and know it
By some who scarce have words enough to show it
For sense sits silent and condemns for weaker
The finer nay sometimes the wittier speaker
But 'tis prodigious so much eloquence
Should be acquired by such little sense
For words and wit did anciently agree 
And Tully was no fool though this man be
At bar abusive on the bench unable
Knave on the woolsack fop at council-table
These are the grievances of such fools as would
Be rather wise than honest great than good
Some other kind of wits must be made known
Whose harmless errors hurt themselves alone
Excess of luxury they think can please
And laziness call loving of their ease
To live dissolved in pleasures still they feign 
Though their whole life but intermitting pain
So much of surfeits headaches claps are seen
We scarce perceive the little time between
Well-meaning men who make this gross mistake
And pleasure lose only for pleasure sake
Each pleasure has its price and when we pay
Too much of pain we squander life away
Thus Dorset purring like a thoughtful cat
Married but wiser puss ne'er thought of that
And first he worried her with railing rhyme 
Like Pembroke mastives at his kindest time
Then for one night sold all his slavish life
A teeming widow but a barren wife
Swell'd by contact of such a fulsome toad
He lugg'd about the matrimonial load
Till fortune blindly kind as well as he
Has ill restored him to his liberty
Which he would use in his old sneaking way
Drinking all night and dozing all the day
Dull as Ned Howard whom his brisker times 
Had famed for dulness in malicious rhymes
Mulgrave had much ado to 'scape the snare
Though learn'd in all those arts that cheat the fair
For after all his vulgar marriage mocks
With beauty dazzled Numps was in the stocks
Deluded parents dried their weeping eyes
To see him catch his Tartar for his prize
The impatient town waited the wish'd-for change
And cuckolds smiled in hopes of sweet revenge
Till Petworth plot made us with sorrow see 
As his estate his person too was free
Him no soft thoughts no gratitude could move
To gold he fled from beauty and from love
Yet failing there he keeps his freedom still
Forced to live happily against his will
'Tis not his fault if too much wealth and power
Break not his boasted quiet every hour
And little Sid for simile renown'd
Pleasure has always sought but never found
Though all his thoughts on wine and women fall 
His are so bad sure he ne'er thinks at all
The flesh he lives upon is rank and strong
His meat and mistresses are kept too long
But sure we all mistake this pious man
Who mortifies his person all he can
What we uncharitably take for sin
Are only rules of this odd capuchin
For never hermit under grave pretence
Has lived more contrary to common sense
And 'tis a miracle we may suppose 
No nastiness offends his skilful nose
Which from all stink can with peculiar art
Extract perfume and essence from a f t
Expecting supper is his great delight
He toils all day but to be drunk at night
Then o'er his cups this night-bird chirping sits
Till he takes Hewet and Jack Hall for wits
Rochester I despise for want of wit
Though thought to have a tail and cloven feet
For while he mischief means to all mankind 
Himself alone the ill effects does find
And so like witches justly suffer shame
Whose harmless malice is so much the same
False are his words affected is his wit
So often he does aim so seldom hit
To every face he cringes while he speaks
But when the back is turn'd the head he breaks
Mean in each action lewd in every limb
Manners themselves are mischievous in him
A proof that chance alone makes every creature 
A very Killigrew without good nature
For what a Bessus has he always lived
And his own kickings notably contrived
For there the folly that still mix'd with fear
Cowards more blows than any hero bear
Of fighting sparks some may their pleasures say
But 'tis a bolder thing to run away
The world may well forgive him all his ill
For every fault does prove his penance still
Falsely he falls into some dangerous noose 
And then as meanly labours to get loose
A life so infamous is better quitting
Spent in base injury and low submitting
I'd like to have left out his poetry
Forgot by all almost as well as me
Sometimes he has some humour never wit
And if it rarely very rarely hit
'Tis under so much nasty rubbish laid
To find it out the cinderwoman trade
Who for the wretched remnants of a fire 
Must toil all day in ashes and in mire
So lewdly dull his idle works appear
The wretched texts deserve no comments here
Where one poor thought sometimes left all alone
For a whole page of dulness must atone
How vain a thing is man and how unwise
Even he who would himself the most despise
I who so wise and humble seem to be
Now my own vanity and pride can't see
While the world nonsense is so sharply shown 
We pull down others' but to raise our own
That we may angels seem we paint them elves
And are but satires to set up ourselves
I who have all this while been finding fault
Even with my master who first satire taught
And did by that describe the task so hard
It seems stupendous and above reward
Now labour with unequal force to climb
That lofty hill unreach'd by former time
'Tis just that I should to the bottom fall 
Learn to write well or not to write at all
Of Man first disobedience and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
Brought death into the World and all our woe
With loss of Eden till one greater Man
Restore us and regain the blissful seat
Sing Heavenly Muse that on the secret top
Of Oreb or of Sinai didst inspire
That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
In the beginning how the heavens and earth
Rose out of Chaos or if Sion hill
Delight thee more and Siloa brook that flowed
Fast by the oracle of God I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th' Aonian mount while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme
And chiefly thou O Spirit that dost prefer
Before all temples th' upright heart and pure
Instruct me for thou know'st thou from the first
Wast present and with mighty wings outspread
Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss
And mad'st it pregnant what in me is dark
Illumine what is low raise and support
That to the height of this great argument
I may assert Eternal Providence
And justify the ways of God to men
Say first for Heaven hides nothing from thy view
Nor the deep tract of Hell say first what cause
Moved our grand parents in that happy state
Favoured of Heaven so highly to fall off
From their Creator and transgress his will
For one restraint lords of the World besides
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt
Th' infernal Serpent he it was whose guile
Stirred up with envy and revenge deceived
The mother of mankind what time his pride
Had cast him out from Heaven with all his host
Of rebel Angels by whose aid aspiring
To set himself in glory above his peers
He trusted to have equalled the Most High
If he opposed and with ambitious aim
Against the throne and monarchy of God
Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud
With vain attempt Him the Almighty Power
Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky
With hideous ruin and combustion down
To bottomless perdition there to dwell
In adamantine chains and penal fire
Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms
Nine times the space that measures day and night
To mortal men he with his horrid crew
Lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf
Confounded though immortal But his doom
Reserved him to more wrath for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate
At once as far as Angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild
A dungeon horrible on all sides round
As one great furnace flamed yet from those flames
No light but rather darkness visible
Served only to discover sights of woe
Regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace
And rest can never dwell hope never comes
That comes to all but torture without end
Still urges and a fiery deluge fed
With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared
For those rebellious here their prison ordained
In utter darkness and their portion set
As far removed from God and light of Heaven
As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole
Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell
There the companions of his fall o'erwhelmed
With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire
He soon discerns and weltering by his side
One next himself in power and next in crime
Long after known in Palestine and named
Beelzebub To whom th' Arch-Enemy
And thence in Heaven called Satan with bold words
Breaking the horrid silence thus began 
If thou beest he but O how fallen how changed
From him who in the happy realms of light
Clothed with transcendent brightness didst outshine
Myriads though bright if he whom mutual league
United thoughts and counsels equal hope
And hazard in the glorious enterprise
Joined with me once now misery hath joined
In equal ruin into what pit thou seest
From what height fallen so much the stronger proved
He with his thunder and till then who knew
The force of those dire arms Yet not for those
Nor what the potent Victor in his rage
Can else inflict do I repent or change
Though changed in outward lustre that fixed mind
And high disdain from sense of injured merit
That with the Mightiest raised me to contend
And to the fierce contentions brought along
Innumerable force of Spirits armed
That durst dislike his reign and me preferring
His utmost power with adverse power opposed
In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven
And shook his throne What though the field be lost
All is not lost the unconquerable will
And study of revenge immortal hate
And courage never to submit or yield
And what is else not to be overcome
That glory never shall his wrath or might
Extort from me To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee and deify his power
Who from the terror of this arm so late
Doubted his empire that were low indeed
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
This downfall since by fate the strength of Gods
And this empyreal substance cannot fail
Since through experience of this great event
In arms not worse in foresight much advanced
We may with more successful hope resolve
To wage by force or guile eternal war
Irreconcilable to our grand Foe
Who now triumphs and in th' excess of joy
Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven
So spake th' apostate Angel though in pain
Vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair
And him thus answered soon his bold compeer 
O Prince O Chief of many throned Powers
That led th' embattled Seraphim to war
Under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds
Fearless endangered Heaven perpetual King
And put to proof his high supremacy
Whether upheld by strength or chance or fate
Too well I see and rue the dire event
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
Hath lost us Heaven and all this mighty host
In horrible destruction laid thus low
As far as Gods and heavenly Essences
Can perish for the mind and spirit remains
Invincible and vigour soon returns
Though all our glory extinct and happy state
Here swallowed up in endless misery
But what if he our Conqueror whom I now
Of force believe almighty since no less
Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours
Have left us this our spirit and strength entire
Strongly to suffer and support our pains
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire
Or do him mightier service as his thralls
By right of war whate'er his business be
Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire
Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep
What can it the avail though yet we feel
Strength undiminished or eternal being
To undergo eternal punishment
Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied 
Fallen Cherub to be weak is miserable
Doing or suffering but of this be sure 
To do aught good never will be our task
But ever to do ill our sole delight
As being the contrary to his high will
Whom we resist If then his providence
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good
Our labour must be to pervert that end
And out of good still to find means of evil
Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps
Shall grieve him if I fail not and disturb
His inmost counsels from their destined aim
But see the angry Victor hath recalled
His ministers of vengeance and pursuit
Back to the gates of Heaven the sulphurous hail
Shot after us in storm o'erblown hath laid
The fiery surge that from the precipice
Of Heaven received us falling and the thunder
Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage
Perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep
Let us not slip th' occasion whether scorn
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe
Seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild
The seat of desolation void of light
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
Casts pale and dreadful Thither let us tend
From off the tossing of these fiery waves
There rest if any rest can harbour there
And re-assembling our afflicted powers
Consult how we may henceforth most offend
Our enemy our own loss how repair
How overcome this dire calamity
What reinforcement we may gain from hope
If not what resolution from despair
Thus Satan talking to his nearest mate
With head uplift above the wave and eyes
That sparkling blazed his other parts besides
Prone on the flood extended long and large
Lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge
As whom the fables name of monstrous size
Titanian or Earth-born that warred on Jove
Briareos or Typhon whom the den
By ancient Tarsus held or that sea-beast
Leviathan which God of all his works
Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream
Him haply slumbering on the Norway foam
The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff
Deeming some island oft as seamen tell
With fixed anchor in his scaly rind
Moors by his side under the lee while night
Invests the sea and wished morn delays
So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay
Chained on the burning lake nor ever thence
Had risen or heaved his head but that the will
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
Left him at large to his own dark designs
That with reiterated crimes he might
Heap on himself damnation while he sought
Evil to others and enraged might see
How all his malice served but to bring forth
Infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn
On Man by him seduced but on himself
Treble confusion wrath and vengeance poured
Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool
His mighty stature on each hand the flames
Driven backward slope their pointing spires and rolled
In billows leave i' th' midst a horrid vale
Then with expanded wings he steers his flight
Aloft incumbent on the dusky air
That felt unusual weight till on dry land
He lights if it were land that ever burned
With solid as the lake with liquid fire
And such appeared in hue as when the force
Of subterranean wind transports a hill
Torn from Pelorus or the shattered side
Of thundering Etna whose combustible
And fuelled entrails thence conceiving fire
Sublimed with mineral fury aid the winds
And leave a singed bottom all involved
With stench and smoke Such resting found the sole
Of unblest feet Him followed his next mate
Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood
As gods and by their own recovered strength
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power
Is this the region this the soil the clime
Said then the lost Archangel this the seat
That we must change for Heaven this mournful gloom
For that celestial light Be it so since he
Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid
What shall be right farthest from him is best
Whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme
Above his equals Farewell happy fields
Where joy for ever dwells Hail horrors hail
Infernal world and thou profoundest Hell
Receive thy new possessor one who brings
A mind not to be changed by place or time
The mind is its own place and in itself
Can make a Heaven of Hell a Hell of Heaven
What matter where if I be still the same
And what I should be all but less than he
Whom thunder hath made greater Here at least
We shall be free th' Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy will not drive us hence
Here we may reign secure and in my choice
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends
Th' associates and co-partners of our loss
Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy mansion or once more
With rallied arms to try what may be yet
Regained in Heaven or what more lost in Hell
So Satan spake and him Beelzebub
Thus answered Leader of those armies bright
Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foiled
If once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge
Of hope in fears and dangers heard so oft
In worst extremes and on the perilous edge
Of battle when it raged in all assaults
Their surest signal they will soon resume
New courage and revive though now they lie
Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire
As we erewhile astounded and amazed
No wonder fallen such a pernicious height
He scarce had ceased when the superior Fiend
Was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield
Ethereal temper massy large and round
Behind him cast The broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views
At evening from the top of Fesole
Or in Valdarno to descry new lands
Rivers or mountains in her spotty globe
His spear to equal which the tallest pine
Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast
Of some great ammiral were but a wand 
He walked with to support uneasy steps
Over the burning marl not like those steps
On Heaven azure and the torrid clime
Smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire
Nathless he so endured till on the beach
Of that inflamed sea he stood and called
His legions Angel Forms who lay entranced
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
In Vallombrosa where th' Etrurian shades
High over-arched embower or scattered sedge
Afloat when with fierce winds Orion armed
Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast whose waves o'erthrew
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry
While with perfidious hatred they pursued
The sojourners of Goshen who beheld
From the safe shore their floating carcases
And broken chariot-wheels So thick bestrown
Abject and lost lay these covering the flood
Under amazement of their hideous change
He called so loud that all the hollow deep
Of Hell resounded Princes Potentates
Warriors the Flower of Heaven once yours now lost
If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal Spirits Or have ye chosen this place
After the toil of battle to repose
Your wearied virtue for the ease you find
To slumber here as in the vales of Heaven
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conqueror who now beholds
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood
With scattered arms and ensigns till anon
His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern
Th' advantage and descending tread us down
Thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf
Awake arise or be for ever fallen
They heard and were abashed and up they sprung
Upon the wing as when men wont to watch
On duty sleeping found by whom they dread
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight
In which they were or the fierce pains not feel
Yet to their General voice they soon obeyed
Innumerable As when the potent rod
Of Amram son in Egypt evil day
Waved round the coast up-called a pitchy cloud
Of locusts warping on the eastern wind
That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung
Like Night and darkened all the land of Nile
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell
'Twixt upper nether and surrounding fires
Till as a signal given th' uplifted spear
Of their great Sultan waving to direct
Their course in even balance down they light
On the firm brimstone and fill all the plain
A multitude like which the populous North
Poured never from her frozen loins to pass
Rhene or the Danaw when her barbarous sons
Came like a deluge on the South and spread
Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands
Forthwith form every squadron and each band
First Moloch horrid king besmeared with blood
Of human sacrifice and parents' tears
Though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud
Their children cries unheard that passed through fire
To his grim idol Him the Ammonite
Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain
In Argob and in Basan to the stream
Of utmost Arnon Nor content with such
Audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart
Of Solomon he led by fraud to build
His temple right against the temple of God
On that opprobrious hill and made his grove
The pleasant valley of Hinnom Tophet thence
And black Gehenna called the type of Hell
Next Chemos th' obscene dread of Moab sons
From Aroar to Nebo and the wild
Of southmost Abarim in Hesebon
And Horonaim Seon real beyond
The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines
And Eleale to th' Asphaltic Pool
Peor his other name when he enticed
Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile
To do him wanton rites which cost them woe
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged
Even to that hill of scandal by the grove
Of Moloch homicide lust hard by hate
Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell
With these came they who from the bordering flood
Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts
Egypt from Syrian ground had general names
Of Baalim and Ashtaroth those male
These feminine For Spirits when they please
Can either sex assume or both so soft
And uncompounded is their essence pure
Not tried or manacled with joint or limb
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones
Like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose
Dilated or condensed bright or obscure
Can execute their airy purposes
And works of love or enmity fulfil
For those the race of Israel oft forsook
Their Living Strength and unfrequented left
His righteous altar bowing lowly down
To bestial gods for which their heads as low
Bowed down in battle sunk before the spear
Of despicable foes With these in troop
Came Astoreth whom the Phoenicians called
Astarte queen of heaven with crescent horns
To whose bright image nightly by the moon
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs
In Sion also not unsung where stood
Her temple on th' offensive mountain built
By that uxorious king whose heart though large
Beguiled by fair idolatresses fell
To idols foul Thammuz came next behind
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate
In amorous ditties all a summer day
While smooth Adonis from his native rock
Ran purple to the sea supposed with blood
Of Thammuz yearly wounded the love-tale
Infected Sion daughters with like heat
Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch
Ezekiel saw when by the vision led
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries
Of alienated Judah Next came one
Who mourned in earnest when the captive ark
Maimed his brute image head and hands lopt off
In his own temple on the grunsel-edge
Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers
Dagon his name sea-monster upward man
And downward fish yet had his temple high
Reared in Azotus dreaded through the coast
Of Palestine in Gath and Ascalon
And Accaron and Gaza frontier bounds
Him followed Rimmon whose delightful seat
Was fair Damascus on the fertile banks
Of Abbana and Pharphar lucid streams
He also against the house of God was bold
A leper once he lost and gained a king 
Ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew
God altar to disparage and displace
For one of Syrian mode whereon to burn
His odious offerings and adore the gods
Whom he had vanquished After these appeared
A crew who under names of old renown 
Osiris Isis Orus and their train 
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
Rather than human Nor did Israel scape
Th' infection when their borrowed gold composed
The calf in Oreb and the rebel king
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox 
Jehovah who in one night when he passed
From Egypt marching equalled with one stroke
Both her first-born and all her bleating gods
Belial came last than whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven or more gross to love
Vice for itself To him no temple stood
Or altar smoked yet who more oft than he
In temples and at altars when the priest
Turns atheist as did Eli sons who filled
With lust and violence the house of God
In courts and palaces he also reigns
And in luxurious cities where the noise
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers
Sat on his throne upheld by old repute
Consent or custom and his regal state
Put forth at full but still his strength concealed 
Which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall
Henceforth his might we know and know our own
So as not either to provoke or dread
New war provoked our better part remains
To work in close design by fraud or guile
What force effected not that he no less
At length from us may find who overcomes
By force hath overcome but half his foe
Space may produce new Worlds whereof so rife
There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long
Intended to create and therein plant
A generation whom his choice regard
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven
Thither if but to pry shall be perhaps
Our first eruption thither or elsewhere
For this infernal pit shall never hold
Celestial Spirits in bondage nor th' Abyss
Long under darkness cover But these thoughts
Full counsel must mature Peace is despaired
For who can think submission War then war
Open or understood must be resolved
He spake and to confirm his words outflew
Millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs
Of mighty Cherubim the sudden blaze
Far round illumined Hell Highly they raged
Against the Highest and fierce with grasped arms
Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven
There stood a hill not far whose grisly top
Belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire
Shone with a glossy scurf undoubted sign
That in his womb was hid metallic ore
The work of sulphur Thither winged with speed
A numerous brigade hastened as when bands
Of pioneers with spade and pickaxe armed
Forerun the royal camp to trench a field
Or cast a rampart Mammon led them on 
Mammon the least erected Spirit that fell
From Heaven for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts
Were always downward bent admiring more
The riches of heaven pavement trodden gold
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed
In vision beatific By him first
Men also and by his suggestion taught
Ransacked the centre and with impious hands
Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth
For treasures better hid Soon had his crew
Opened into the hill a spacious wound
And digged out ribs of gold Let none admire
That riches grow in Hell that soil may best
Deserve the precious bane And here let those
Who boast in mortal things and wondering tell
Of Babel and the works of Memphian kings
Learn how their greatest monuments of fame
And strength and art are easily outdone
By Spirits reprobate and in an hour
What in an age they with incessant toil
And hands innumerable scarce perform
Nigh on the plain in many cells prepared
That underneath had veins of liquid fire
Sluiced from the lake a second multitude
With wondrous art founded the massy ore
Severing each kind and scummed the bullion-dross
A third as soon had formed within the ground
A various mould and from the boiling cells
By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook
As in an organ from one blast of wind
To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge
Rose like an exhalation with the sound
Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet 
Built like a temple where pilasters round
Were set and Doric pillars overlaid
With golden architrave nor did there want
Cornice or frieze with bossy sculptures graven
The roof was fretted gold Not Babylon
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence
Equalled in all their glories to enshrine
Belus or Serapis their gods or seat
Their kings when Egypt with Assyria strove
In wealth and luxury Th' ascending pile
Stood fixed her stately height and straight the doors
Opening their brazen folds discover wide
Within her ample spaces o'er the smooth
And level pavement from the arched roof
Pendent by subtle magic many a row
Of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed
With naptha and asphaltus yielded light
As from a sky The hasty multitude
Admiring entered and the work some praise
And some the architect His hand was known
In Heaven by many a towered structure high
Where sceptred Angels held their residence
And sat as Princes whom the supreme King
Exalted to such power and gave to rule
Each in his Hierarchy the Orders bright
Nor was his name unheard or unadored
In ancient Greece and in Ausonian land
Men called him Mulciber and how he fell
From Heaven they fabled thrown by angry Jove
Sheer o'er the crystal battlements from morn
To noon he fell from noon to dewy eve
A summer day and with the setting sun
Dropt from the zenith like a falling star
On Lemnos th' Aegaean isle Thus they relate
Erring for he with this rebellious rout
Fell long before nor aught availed him now
To have built in Heaven high towers nor did he scape
By all his engines but was headlong sent
With his industrious crew to build in Hell
Meanwhile the winged Heralds by command
Of sovereign power with awful ceremony
And trumpet sound throughout the host proclaim
A solemn council forthwith to be held
At Pandemonium the high capital
Of Satan and his peers Their summons called
From every band and squared regiment
By place or choice the worthiest they anon
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
Attended All access was thronged the gates
And porches wide but chief the spacious hall
Though like a covered field where champions bold
Wont ride in armed and at the Soldan chair
Defied the best of Paynim chivalry
To mortal combat or career with lance
Thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air
Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings As bees
In spring-time when the Sun with Taurus rides
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
In clusters they among fresh dews and flowers
Fly to and fro or on the smoothed plank
Powers and Dominions Deities of Heaven 
For since no deep within her gulf can hold
Immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen
I give not Heaven for lost from this descent
Celestial Virtues rising will appear
More glorious and more dread than from no fall
And trust themselves to fear no second fate 
Me though just right and the fixed laws of Heaven
Did first create your leader next free choice
With what besides in council or in fight
Hath been achieved of merit yet this loss
Thus far at least recovered hath much more
Established in a safe unenvied throne
Yielded with full consent The happier state
In Heaven which follows dignity might draw
Envy from each inferior but who here
Will envy whom the highest place exposes
Foremost to stand against the Thunderer aim
Your bulwark and condemns to greatest share
Of endless pain Where there is then no good
For which to strive no strife can grow up there
From faction for none sure will claim in Hell
Precedence none whose portion is so small
Of present pain that with ambitious mind
Will covet more With this advantage then
To union and firm faith and firm accord
More than can be in Heaven we now return
To claim our just inheritance of old
Surer to prosper than prosperity
Could have assured us and by what best way
Whether of open war or covert guile
We now debate Who can advise may speak
He ceased and next him Moloch sceptred king
Stood up the strongest and the fiercest Spirit
That fought in Heaven now fiercer by despair
His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed
Equal in strength and rather than be less
Cared not to be at all with that care lost
Went all his fear of God or Hell or worse
He recked not and these words thereafter spake 
My sentence is for open war Of wiles
More unexpert I boast not them let those
Contrive who need or when they need not now
For while they sit contriving shall the rest 
Millions that stand in arms and longing wait
The signal to ascend sit lingering here
Heaven fugitives and for their dwelling-place
Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame
The prison of his tyranny who reigns
By our delay No let us rather choose
Armed with Hell-flames and fury all at once
O'er Heaven high towers to force resistless way
Turning our tortures into horrid arms
Against the Torturer when to meet the noise
Of his almighty engine he shall hear
Infernal thunder and for lightning see
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
Among his Angels and his throne itself
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire
His own invented torments But perhaps
The way seems difficult and steep to scale
With upright wing against a higher foe
Let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
Of that forgetful lake benumb not still
That in our proper motion we ascend
Up to our native seat descent and fall
To us is adverse Who but felt of late
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
Insulting and pursued us through the Deep
With what compulsion and laborious flight
We sunk thus low Th' ascent is easy then
Th' event is feared Should we again provoke
Our stronger some worse way his wrath may find
To our destruction if there be in Hell
Fear to be worse destroyed What can be worse
Than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned
In this abhorred deep to utter woe
Where pain of unextinguishable fire
Must exercise us without hope of end
The vassals of his anger when the scourge
Inexorably and the torturing hour
Calls us to penance More destroyed than thus
We should be quite abolished and expire
What fear we then what doubt we to incense
His utmost ire which to the height enraged
Will either quite consume us and reduce
To nothing this essential happier far
Than miserable to have eternal being 
Or if our substance be indeed divine
And cannot cease to be we are at worst
On this side nothing and by proof we feel
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven
And with perpetual inroads to alarm
Though inaccessible his fatal throne
Which if not victory is yet revenge
He ended frowning and his look denounced
Desperate revenge and battle dangerous
To less than gods On th' other side up rose
Belial in act more graceful and humane
A fairer person lost not Heaven he seemed
For dignity composed and high exploit
But all was false and hollow though his tongue
Dropped manna and could make the worse appear
The better reason to perplex and dash
Maturest counsels for his thoughts were low 
To vice industrious but to nobler deeds
Timorous and slothful Yet he pleased the ear
And with persuasive accent thus began 
I should be much for open war O Peers
As not behind in hate if what was urged
Main reason to persuade immediate war
Did not dissuade me most and seem to cast
Ominous conjecture on the whole success
When he who most excels in fact of arms
In what he counsels and in what excels
Mistrustful grounds his courage on despair
And utter dissolution as the scope
Of all his aim after some dire revenge
First what revenge The towers of Heaven are filled
With armed watch that render all access
Impregnable oft on the bordering Deep
Encamp their legions or with obscure wing
Scout far and wide into the realm of Night
Scorning surprise Or could we break our way
By force and at our heels all Hell should rise
With blackest insurrection to confound
Heaven purest light yet our great Enemy
All incorruptible would on his throne
Sit unpolluted and th' ethereal mould
Incapable of stain would soon expel
Her mischief and purge off the baser fire
Victorious Thus repulsed our final hope
Is flat despair we must exasperate
Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage
And that must end us that must be our cure 
To be no more Sad cure for who would lose
Though full of pain this intellectual being
Those thoughts that wander through eternity
To perish rather swallowed up and lost
In the wide womb of uncreated Night
Devoid of sense and motion And who knows
Let this be good whether our angry Foe
Can give it or will ever How he can
Is doubtful that he never will is sure
Will he so wise let loose at once his ire
Belike through impotence or unaware
To give his enemies their wish and end
Them in his anger whom his anger saves
To punish endless Wherefore cease we then
Say they who counsel war we are decreed
Reserved and destined to eternal woe
Whatever doing what can we suffer more
What can we suffer worse Is this then worst 
Thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms
What when we fled amain pursued and struck
With Heaven afflicting thunder and besought
The Deep to shelter us This Hell then seemed
A refuge from those wounds Or when we lay
Chained on the burning lake That sure was worse
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires
Awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage
And plunge us in the flames or from above
Should intermitted vengeance arm again
His red right hand to plague us What if all
Her stores were opened and this firmament
Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire
Impendent horrors threatening hideous fall
One day upon our heads while we perhaps
Designing or exhorting glorious war
Caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled
Each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey
Or racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk
Under yon boiling ocean wrapt in chains
There to converse with everlasting groans
Unrespited unpitied unreprieved
Ages of hopeless end This would be worse
War therefore open or concealed alike
My voice dissuades for what can force or guile
With him or who deceive his mind whose eye
Views all things at one view He from Heaven height
All these our motions vain sees and derides
Not more almighty to resist our might
Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles
Shall we then live thus vile the race of Heaven
Thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here
Chains and these torments Better these than worse
By my advice since fate inevitable
Subdues us and omnipotent decree
The Victor will To suffer as to do
Our strength is equal nor the law unjust
That so ordains This was at first resolved
If we were wise against so great a foe
Contending and so doubtful what might fall
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold
And venturous if that fail them shrink and fear
What yet they know must follow to endure
Exile or ignominy or bonds or pain
The sentence of their Conqueror This is now
Our doom which if we can sustain and bear
Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit
His anger and perhaps thus far removed
Not mind us not offending satisfied
With what is punished whence these raging fires
Will slacken if his breath stir not their flames
Our purer essence then will overcome
Their noxious vapour or inured not feel
Or changed at length and to the place conformed
In temper and in nature will receive
Familiar the fierce heat and void of pain
This horror will grow mild this darkness light
Besides what hope the never-ending flight
Of future days may bring what chance what change
Worth waiting since our present lot appears
For happy though but ill for ill not worst
If we procure not to ourselves more woe
Thus Belial with words clothed in reason garb
Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth
Not peace and after him thus Mammon spake 
Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven
We war if war be best or to regain
Our own right lost Him to unthrone we then
May hope when everlasting Fate shall yield
To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife
The former vain to hope argues as vain
The latter for what place can be for us
Within Heaven bound unless Heaven Lord supreme
We overpower Suppose he should relent
And publish grace to all on promise made
Of new subjection with what eyes could we
Stand in his presence humble and receive
Strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne
With warbled hymns and to his Godhead sing
Forced hallelujahs while he lordly sits
Our envied sovereign and his altar breathes
Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers
Our servile offerings This must be our task
In Heaven this our delight How wearisome
Eternity so spent in worship paid
To whom we hate Let us not then pursue
By force impossible by leave obtained
Unacceptable though in Heaven our state
Of splendid vassalage but rather seek
Our own good from ourselves and from our own
Live to ourselves though in this vast recess
Free and to none accountable preferring
Hard liberty before the easy yoke
Of servile pomp Our greatness will appear
Then most conspicuous when great things of small
Useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse
We can create and in what place soe'er
Thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
Through labour and endurance This deep world
Of darkness do we dread How oft amidst
Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven all-ruling Sire
Choose to reside his glory unobscured
And with the majesty of darkness round
Covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar
Mustering their rage and Heaven resembles Hell
As he our darkness cannot we his light
Imitate when we please This desert soil
Wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold
Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
Magnificence and what can Heaven show more
Our torments also may in length of time
Become our elements these piercing fires
As soft as now severe our temper changed
Into their temper which must needs remove
The sensible of pain All things invite
To peaceful counsels and the settled state
Of order how in safety best we may
Compose our present evils with regard
Of what we are and where dismissing quite
All thoughts of war Ye have what I advise
He scarce had finished when such murmur filled
Th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain
The sound of blustering winds which all night long
Had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull
Seafaring men o'erwatched whose bark by chance
Or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
After the tempest Such applause was heard
As Mammon ended and his sentence pleased
Advising peace for such another field
They dreaded worse than Hell so much the fear
Of thunder and the sword of Michael
Wrought still within them and no less desire
To found this nether empire which might rise
By policy and long process of time
In emulation opposite to Heaven
Which when Beelzebub perceived than whom
Satan except none higher sat with grave
Aspect he rose and in his rising seemed
A pillar of state Deep on his front engraven
Deliberation sat and public care
And princely counsel in his face yet shone
Majestic though in ruin Sage he stood
With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear
The weight of mightiest monarchies his look
Drew audience and attention still as night
Or summer noontide air while thus he spake 
Thrones and Imperial Powers Offspring of Heaven
Ethereal Virtues or these titles now
Must we renounce and changing style be called
Princes of Hell for so the popular vote
Inclines here to continue and build up here
A growing empire doubtless while we dream
And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed
This place our dungeon not our safe retreat
Beyond his potent arm to live exempt
From Heaven high jurisdiction in new league
Banded against his throne but to remain
In strictest bondage though thus far removed
Under th' inevitable curb reserved
His captive multitude For he to be sure
In height or depth still first and last will reign
Sole king and of his kingdom lose no part
By our revolt but over Hell extend
His empire and with iron sceptre rule
Us here as with his golden those in Heaven
What sit we then projecting peace and war
War hath determined us and foiled with loss
Irreparable terms of peace yet none
Vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given
To us enslaved but custody severe
And stripes and arbitrary punishment
Inflicted and what peace can we return
But to our power hostility and hate
Untamed reluctance and revenge though slow
Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least
May reap his conquest and may least rejoice
In doing what we most in suffering feel
Nor will occasion want nor shall we need
With dangerous expedition to invade
Heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege
Or ambush from the Deep What if we find
Some easier enterprise There is a place
If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven
Err not another World the happy seat
Of some new race called Man about this time
To be created like to us though less
In power and excellence but favoured more
Of him who rules above so was his will
Pronounced among the Gods and by an oath
That shook Heaven whole circumference confirmed
Thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn
What creatures there inhabit of what mould
Or substance how endued and what their power
And where their weakness how attempted best
By force of subtlety Though Heaven be shut
And Heaven high Arbitrator sit secure
In his own strength this place may lie exposed
The utmost border of his kingdom left
To their defence who hold it here perhaps
Some advantageous act may be achieved
By sudden onset either with Hell-fire
To waste his whole creation or possess
All as our own and drive as we were driven
The puny habitants or if not drive
Seduce them to our party that their God
May prove their foe and with repenting hand
Abolish his own works This would surpass
Common revenge and interrupt his joy
In our confusion and our joy upraise
In his disturbance when his darling sons
Hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse
Their frail original and faded bliss 
Faded so soon Advise if this be worth
Attempting or to sit in darkness here
Hatching vain empires Thus Beelzebub
Pleaded his devilish counsel first devised
By Satan and in part proposed for whence
But from the author of all ill could spring
So deep a malice to confound the race
Of mankind in one root and Earth with Hell
To mingle and involve done all to spite
The great Creator But their spite still serves
His glory to augment The bold design
Pleased highly those infernal States and joy
Sparkled in all their eyes with full assent
They vote whereat his speech he thus renews 
Well have ye judged well ended long debate
Synod of Gods and like to what ye are
Great things resolved which from the lowest deep
Will once more lift us up in spite of fate
Nearer our ancient seat perhaps in view
Of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms
And opportune excursion we may chance
Re-enter Heaven or else in some mild zone
Dwell not unvisited of Heaven fair light
Secure and at the brightening orient beam
Purge off this gloom the soft delicious air
To heal the scar of these corrosive fires
Shall breathe her balm But first whom shall we send
In search of this new World whom shall we find
Sufficient who shall tempt with wandering feet
The dark unbottomed infinite Abyss
And through the palpable obscure find out
His uncouth way or spread his airy flight
In other countenance read his own dismay
Astonished None among the choice and prime
Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found
So hardy as to proffer or accept
Alone the dreadful voyage till at last
Satan whom now transcendent glory raised
Above his fellows with monarchal pride
Conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake 
O Progeny of Heaven Empyreal Thrones
With reason hath deep silence and demur
Seized us though undismayed Long is the way
And hard that out of Hell leads up to light
Our prison strong this huge convex of fire
Outrageous to devour immures us round
Ninefold and gates of burning adamant
Barred over us prohibit all egress
These passed if any pass the void profound
Of unessential Night receives him next
Wide-gaping and with utter loss of being
Threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf
If thence he scape into whatever world
Or unknown region what remains him less
Than unknown dangers and as hard escape
But I should ill become this throne O Peers
And this imperial sovereignty adorned
With splendour armed with power if aught proposed
And judged of public moment in the shape
Of difficulty or danger could deter
Me from attempting Wherefore do I assume
These royalties and not refuse to reign
Refusing to accept as great a share
Of hazard as of honour due alike
To him who reigns and so much to him due
Of hazard more as he above the rest
High honoured sits Go therefore mighty Powers
Terror of Heaven though fallen intend at home
While here shall be our home what best may ease
The present misery and render Hell
More tolerable if there be cure or charm
To respite or deceive or slack the pain
Of this ill mansion intermit no watch
Against a wakeful foe while I abroad
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
Deliverance for us all This enterprise
None shall partake with me Thus saying rose
The Monarch and prevented all reply
Prudent lest from his resolution raised
Others among the chief might offer now
Certain to be refused what erst they feared
And so refused might in opinion stand
His rivals winning cheap the high repute
Which he through hazard huge must earn But they
Dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice
Forbidding and at once with him they rose
Their rising all at once was as the sound
Of thunder heard remote Towards him they bend
With awful reverence prone and as a God
Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven
Nor failed they to express how much they praised
That for the general safety he despised
His own for neither do the Spirits damned
Lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast
Their specious deeds on earth which glory excites
Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal
Thus they their doubtful consultations dark
Ended rejoicing in their matchless Chief
As when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds
Ascending while the north wind sleeps o'erspread
Heaven cheerful face the louring element
Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower
If chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet
Extend his evening beam the fields revive
The birds their notes renew and bleating herds
Attest their joy that hill and valley rings
O shame to men Devil with devil damned
Firm concord holds men only disagree
Of creatures rational though under hope
Of heavenly grace and God proclaiming peace
Yet live in hatred enmity and strife
Among themselves and levy cruel wars
Wasting the earth each other to destroy
As if which might induce us to accord
Man had not hellish foes enow besides
That day and night for his destruction wait
The Stygian council thus dissolved and forth
In order came the grand infernal Peers
Midst came their mighty Paramount and seemed
Alone th' antagonist of Heaven nor less
Than Hell dread Emperor with pomp supreme
And god-like imitated state him round
A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed
With bright emblazonry and horrent arms
Then of their session ended they bid cry
With trumpet regal sound the great result
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy
By herald voice explained the hollow Abyss
Heard far and wide and all the host of Hell
With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim
Thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised
By false presumptuous hope the ranged Powers
Disband and wandering each his several way
Pursues as inclination or sad choice
Leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find
Truce to his restless thoughts and entertain
The irksome hours till his great Chief return
Part on the plain or in the air sublime
Upon the wing or in swift race contend
As at th' Olympian games or Pythian fields
Part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal
With rapid wheels or fronted brigades form
As when to warn proud cities war appears
Waged in the troubled sky and armies rush
To battle in the clouds before each van
Prick forth the airy knights and couch their spears
Till thickest legions close with feats of arms
From either end of heaven the welkin burns
Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell
Rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air
In whirlwind Hell scarce holds the wild uproar 
As when Alcides from Oechalia crowned
With conquest felt th' envenomed robe and tore
Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines
And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw
Into th' Euboic sea Others more mild
Retreated in a silent valley sing
With notes angelical to many a harp
Their own heroic deeds and hapless fall
By doom of battle and complain that Fate
Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance
Their song was partial but the harmony
What could it less when Spirits immortal sing
Suspended Hell and took with ravishment
The thronging audience In discourse more sweet
For Eloquence the Soul Song charms the Sense
Others apart sat on a hill retired
In thoughts more elevate and reasoned high
Of Providence Foreknowledge Will and Fate 
Fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute
And found no end in wandering mazes lost
Of good and evil much they argued then
Of happiness and final misery
Passion and apathy and glory and shame
Vain wisdom all and false philosophy 
Yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm
Pain for a while or anguish and excite
Fallacious hope or arm th' obdured breast
With stubborn patience as with triple steel
Another part in squadrons and gross bands
On bold adventure to discover wide
That dismal world if any clime perhaps
Might yield them easier habitation bend
Four ways their flying march along the banks
Of four infernal rivers that disgorge
Into the burning lake their baleful streams 
Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate
Sad Acheron of sorrow black and deep
Cocytus named of lamentation loud
Heard on the rueful stream fierce Phlegeton
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage
Far off from these a slow and silent stream
Lethe the river of oblivion rolls
Her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks
Forthwith his former state and being forgets 
Forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain
Beyond this flood a frozen continent
Lies dark and wild beat with perpetual storms
Of whirlwind and dire hail which on firm land
Thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems
Of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice
A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog
Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old
Where armies whole have sunk the parching air
Burns frore and cold performs th' effect of fire
Thither by harpy-footed Furies haled
At certain revolutions all the damned
Are brought and feel by turns the bitter change
Of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce
From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
Their soft ethereal warmth and there to pine
Immovable infixed and frozen round
Periods of time thence hurried back to fire
They ferry over this Lethean sound
Both to and fro their sorrow to augment
And wish and struggle as they pass to reach
The tempting stream with one small drop to lose
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe
All in one moment and so near the brink
But Fate withstands and to oppose th' attempt
Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
The ford and of itself the water flies
All taste of living wight as once it fled
The lip of Tantalus Thus roving on
In confused march forlorn th' adventurous bands
With shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast
Viewed first their lamentable lot and found
No rest Through many a dark and dreary vale
They passed and many a region dolorous
O'er many a frozen many a fiery alp
Rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death 
A universe of death which God by curse
Created evil for evil only good
Where all life dies death lives and Nature breeds
Perverse all monstrous all prodigious things
Obominable inutterable and worse
Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived
Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire
Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man
Satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design
Puts on swift wings and toward the gates of Hell
Explores his solitary flight sometimes
He scours the right hand coast sometimes the left
Now shaves with level wing the deep then soars
Up to the fiery concave towering high
As when far off at sea a fleet descried
Hangs in the clouds by equinoctial winds
Close sailing from Bengala or the isles
Of Ternate and Tidore whence merchants bring
Their spicy drugs they on the trading flood
Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape
Ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed
Far off the flying Fiend At last appear
Hell-bounds high reaching to the horrid roof
And thrice threefold the gates three folds were brass
Three iron three of adamantine rock
Impenetrable impaled with circling fire
Yet unconsumed Before the gates there sat
On either side a formidable Shape
The one seemed woman to the waist and fair
But ended foul in many a scaly fold
Voluminous and vast a serpent armed
With mortal sting About her middle round
A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked
With wide Cerberean mouths full loud and rung
A hideous peal yet when they list would creep
If aught disturbed their noise into her womb
And kennel there yet there still barked and howled
Within unseen Far less abhorred than these
Vexed Scylla bathing in the sea that parts
Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore
Nor uglier follow the night-hag when called
In secret riding through the air she comes
Lured with the smell of infant blood to dance
With Lapland witches while the labouring moon
Eclipses at their charms The other Shape 
If shape it might be called that shape had none
Distinguishable in member joint or limb
Or substance might be called that shadow seemed
For each seemed either black it stood as Night
Fierce as ten Furies terrible as Hell
And shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head
The likeness of a kingly crown had on
Satan was now at hand and from his seat
The monster moving onward came as fast
With horrid strides Hell trembled as he strode
Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired 
Admired not feared God and his Son except
Created thing naught valued he nor shunned
And with disdainful look thus first began 
Whence and what art thou execrable Shape
That dar'st though grim and terrible advance
Thy miscreated front athwart my way
To yonder gates Through them I mean to pass
That be assured without leave asked of thee
Retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof
Hell-born not to contend with Spirits of Heaven
To whom the Goblin full of wrath replied 
Art thou that traitor Angel art thou he
Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith till then
Unbroken and in proud rebellious arms
Drew after him the third part of Heaven sons
Conjured against the Highest for which both thou
And they outcast from God are here condemned
To waste eternal days in woe and pain
And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven
Hell-doomed and breath'st defiance here and scorn
Where I reign king and to enrage thee more
Thy king and lord Back to thy punishment
False fugitive and to thy speed add wings
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue
Thy lingering or with one stroke of this dart
Strange horror seize thee and pangs unfelt before
So spake the grisly Terror and in shape
So speaking and so threatening grew tenfold
More dreadful and deform On th' other side
Incensed with indignation Satan stood
Unterrified and like a comet burned
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
In th' arctic sky and from his horrid hair
Shakes pestilence and war Each at the head
Levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands
No second stroke intend and such a frown
Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds
With heaven artillery fraught came rattling on
Over the Caspian then stand front to front
Hovering a space till winds the signal blow
To join their dark encounter in mid-air
So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell
Grew darker at their frown so matched they stood
For never but once more was wither like
To meet so great a foe And now great deeds
Had been achieved whereof all Hell had rung
Had not the snaky Sorceress that sat
Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key
Risen and with hideous outcry rushed between
O father what intends thy hand she cried
Against thy only son What fury O son
Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart
Against thy father head And know'st for whom
For him who sits above and laughs the while
At thee ordained his drudge to execute
Whate'er his wrath which he calls justice bids 
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both
She spake and at her words the hellish Pest
Forbore then these to her Satan returned 
So strange thy outcry and thy words so strange
Thou interposest that my sudden hand
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
What it intends till first I know of thee
What thing thou art thus double-formed and why
In this infernal vale first met thou call'st
Me father and that phantasm call'st my son
I know thee not nor ever saw till now
Sight more detestable than him and thee
T' whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied 
Hast thou forgot me then and do I seem
Now in thine eye so foul once deemed so fair
In Heaven when at th' assembly and in sight
Of all the Seraphim with thee combined
In bold conspiracy against Heaven King
All on a sudden miserable pain
Surprised thee dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
In darkness while thy head flames thick and fast
Threw forth till on the left side opening wide
Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright
Then shining heavenly fair a goddess armed
Out of thy head I sprung Amazement seized
All th' host of Heaven back they recoiled afraid
At first and called me Sin and for a sign
Portentous held me but familiar grown
I pleased and with attractive graces won
The most averse thee chiefly who full oft
Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing
Becam'st enamoured and such joy thou took'st
With me in secret that my womb conceived
A growing burden Meanwhile war arose
And fields were fought in Heaven wherein remained
For what could else to our Almighty Foe
Clear victory to our part loss and rout
Through all the Empyrean Down they fell
Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven down
Into this Deep and in the general fall
I also at which time this powerful key
Into my hands was given with charge to keep
These gates for ever shut which none can pass
Without my opening Pensive here I sat
Alone but long I sat not till my womb
Pregnant by thee and now excessive grown
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest
Thine own begotten breaking violent way
Tore through my entrails that with fear and pain
Distorted all my nether shape thus grew
Transformed but he my inbred enemy
Forth issued brandishing his fatal dart
Made to destroy I fled and cried out Death
Hell trembled at the hideous name and sighed
From all her caves and back resounded Death
I fled but he pursued though more it seems
Inflamed with lust than rage and swifter far
Me overtook his mother all dismayed
And in embraces forcible and foul
Engendering with me of that rape begot
These yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry
Surround me as thou saw'st hourly conceived
And hourly born with sorrow infinite
To me for when they list into the womb
That bred them they return and howl and gnaw
My bowels their repast then bursting forth
Afresh with conscious terrors vex me round
That rest or intermission none I find
Before mine eyes in opposition sits
Grim Death my son and foe who set them on
And me his parent would full soon devour
For want of other prey but that he knows
His end with mine involved and knows that I
Should prove a bitter morsel and his bane
Whenever that shall be so Fate pronounced
But thou O father I forewarn thee shun
His deadly arrow neither vainly hope
To be invulnerable in those bright arms
Through tempered heavenly for that mortal dint
Save he who reigns above none can resist
She finished and the subtle Fiend his lore
Soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth 
Dear daughter since thou claim'st me for thy sire
And my fair son here show'st me the dear pledge
Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven and joys
Then sweet now sad to mention through dire change
Befallen us unforeseen unthought-of know
I come no enemy but to set free
From out this dark and dismal house of pain
Both him and thee and all the heavenly host
Of Spirits that in our just pretences armed
Fell with us from on high From them I go
This uncouth errand sole and one for all
Myself expose with lonely steps to tread
Th' unfounded Deep and through the void immense
To search with wandering quest a place foretold
Should be and by concurring signs ere now
Created vast and round a place of bliss
In the purlieus of Heaven and therein placed
A race of upstart creatures to supply
Perhaps our vacant room though more removed
Lest Heaven surcharged with potent multitude
Might hap to move new broils Be this or aught
Than this more secret now designed I haste
To know and this once known shall soon return
And bring ye to the place where thou and Death
Shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen
Wing silently the buxom air embalmed
With odours There ye shall be fed and filled
Immeasurably all things shall be your prey
He ceased for both seemed highly pleased and Death
Grinned horrible a ghastly smile to hear
His famine should be filled and blessed his maw
Destined to that good hour No less rejoiced
His mother bad and thus bespake her sire 
The key of this infernal Pit by due
And by command of Heaven all-powerful King
I keep by him forbidden to unlock
These adamantine gates against all force
Death ready stands to interpose his dart
Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might
But what owe I to his commands above
Who hates me and hath hither thrust me down
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound
To sit in hateful office here confined
Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born 
Here in perpetual agony and pain
With terrors and with clamours compassed round
Of mine own brood that on my bowels feed
Thou art my father thou my author thou
My being gav'st me whom should I obey
But thee whom follow Thou wilt bring me soon
To that new world of light and bliss among
The gods who live at ease where I shall reign
At thy right hand voluptuous as beseems
Thy daughter and thy darling without end
Thus saying from her side the fatal key
Sad instrument of all our woe she took
And towards the gate rolling her bestial train
Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew
Which but herself not all the Stygian Powers
Could once have moved then in the key-hole turns
Th' intricate wards and every bolt and bar
Of massy iron or solid rock with ease
Unfastens On a sudden open fly
With impetuous recoil and jarring sound
Th' infernal doors and on their hinges grate
Harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook
Of Erebus She opened but to shut
Excelled her power the gates wide open stood
That with extended wings a bannered host
Under spread ensigns marching might pass through
With horse and chariots ranked in loose array
So wide they stood and like a furnace-mouth
Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame
Before their eyes in sudden view appear
The secrets of the hoary Deep a dark
Illimitable ocean without bound
Without dimension where length breadth and height
And time and place are lost where eldest Night
And Chaos ancestors of Nature hold
Eternal anarchy amidst the noise
Of endless wars and by confusion stand
For Hot Cold Moist and Dry four champions fierce
Strive here for mastery and to battle bring
Their embryon atoms they around the flag
Of each his faction in their several clans
Light-armed or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow
Swarm populous unnumbered as the sands
Of Barca or Cyrene torrid soil
Levied to side with warring winds and poise
Their lighter wings To whom these most adhere
He rules a moment Chaos umpire sits
And by decision more embroils the fray
By which he reigns next him high arbiter
Chance governs all Into this wild Abyss
The womb of Nature and perhaps her grave
Of neither sea nor shore nor air nor fire
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed
Confusedly and which thus must ever fight
Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain
His dark materials to create more worlds 
Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend
Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while
Pondering his voyage for no narrow frith
He had to cross Nor was his ear less pealed
With noises loud and ruinous to compare
Great things with small than when Bellona storms
With all her battering engines bent to rase
Some capital city or less than if this frame
Of Heaven were falling and these elements
In mutiny had from her axle torn
The steadfast Earth At last his sail-broad vans
He spread for flight and in the surging smoke
Uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league
As in a cloudy chair ascending rides
Audacious but that seat soon failing meets
A vast vacuity All unawares
Fluttering his pennons vain plumb-down he drops
Ten thousand fathom deep and to this hour
Down had been falling had not by ill chance
The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud
Instinct with fire and nitre hurried him
As many miles aloft That fury stayed 
Quenched in a boggy Syrtis neither sea
Nor good dry land nigh foundered on he fares
Treading the crude consistence half on foot
Half flying behoves him now both oar and sail
As when a gryphon through the wilderness
With winged course o'er hill or moory dale
Pursues the Arimaspian who by stealth
Had from his wakeful custody purloined
The guarded gold so eagerly the Fiend
O'er bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare
With head hands wings or feet pursues his way
And swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies
At length a universal hubbub wild
Of stunning sounds and voices all confused
Borne through the hollow dark assaults his ear
With loudest vehemence Thither he plies
Undaunted to meet there whatever Power
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
Might in that noise reside of whom to ask
Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
Bordering on light when straight behold the throne
Of Chaos and his dark pavilion spread
Wide on the wasteful Deep With him enthroned
Sat sable-vested Night eldest of things
The consort of his reign and by them stood
Orcus and Ades and the dreaded name
Of Demogorgon Rumour next and Chance
And Tumult and Confusion all embroiled
And Discord with a thousand various mouths
T' whom Satan turning boldly thus Ye Powers
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss
Chaos and ancient Night I come no spy
With purpose to explore or to disturb
The secrets of your realm but by constraint
Wandering this darksome desert as my way
Lies through your spacious empire up to light
Alone and without guide half lost I seek
What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
Confine with Heaven or if some other place
From your dominion won th' Ethereal King
Possesses lately thither to arrive
I travel this profound Direct my course
Directed no mean recompense it brings
To your behoof if I that region lost
All usurpation thence expelled reduce
To her original darkness and your sway
Which is my present journey and once more
Erect the standard there of ancient Night
Yours be th' advantage all mine the revenge
Thus Satan and him thus the Anarch old
With faltering speech and visage incomposed
Answered I know thee stranger who thou art 
That mighty leading Angel who of late
Made head against Heaven King though overthrown
I saw and heard for such a numerous host
Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep
With ruin upon ruin rout on rout
Confusion worse confounded and Heaven-gates
Poured out by millions her victorious bands
Pursuing I upon my frontiers here
Keep residence if all I can will serve
That little which is left so to defend
Encroached on still through our intestine broils
Weakening the sceptre of old Night first Hell
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath
Now lately Heaven and Earth another world
Hung o'er my realm linked in a golden chain
To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell
If that way be your walk you have not far
So much the nearer danger Go and speed
Havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain
He ceased and Satan stayed not to reply
But glad that now his sea should find a shore
With fresh alacrity and force renewed
Springs upward like a pyramid of fire
Into the wild expanse and through the shock
Of fighting elements on all sides round
Environed wins his way harder beset
And more endangered than when Argo passed
Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks
Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned
Charybdis and by th' other whirlpool steered
So he with difficulty and labour hard
Moved on with difficulty and labour he
But he once passed soon after when Man fell
Strange alteration Sin and Death amain
Following his track such was the will of Heaven
Paved after him a broad and beaten way
Over the dark Abyss whose boiling gulf
Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length
From Hell continued reaching th' utmost orb
Of this frail World by which the Spirits perverse
With easy intercourse pass to and fro
To tempt or punish mortals except whom
God and good Angels guard by special grace
But now at last the sacred influence
Of light appears and from the walls of Heaven
Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night
A glimmering dawn Here Nature first begins
Her farthest verge and Chaos to retire
As from her outmost works a broken foe
With tumult less and with less hostile din
That Satan with less toil and now with ease
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
And like a weather-beaten vessel holds
Gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn
Or in the emptier waste resembling air
Weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold
Far off th' empyreal Heaven extended wide
In circuit undetermined square or round
With opal towers and battlements adorned
Of living sapphire once his native seat
And fast by hanging in a golden chain
This pendent World in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude close by the moon
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge
Accursed and in a cursed hour he hies
Hail holy Light offspring of Heaven firstborn
Or of the Eternal coeternal beam
May I express thee unblam'd since God is light
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from eternity dwelt then in thee
Bright effluence of bright essence increate
Or hear'st thou rather pure ethereal stream
Whose fountain who shall tell before the sun
Before the Heavens thou wert and at the voice
Of God as with a mantle didst invest
The rising world of waters dark and deep
Won from the void and formless infinite
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing
Escap'd the Stygian pool though long detain'd
In that obscure sojourn while in my flight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre
I sung of Chaos and eternal Night
Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down
The dark descent and up to re-ascend
Though hard and rare Thee I revisit safe
And feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou
Revisit'st not these eyes that roll in vain
To find thy piercing ray and find no dawn
So thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs
Or dim suffusion veil'd Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
Clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill
Smit with the love of sacred song but chief
Thee Sion and the flowery brooks beneath
That wash thy hallow'd feet and warbling flow
Nightly I visit nor sometimes forget
So were I equall'd with them in renown
Thy sovran command that Man should find grace
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides
And Tiresias and Phineus prophets old
Then feed on thoughts that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird
Sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal note Thus with the year
Seasons return but not to me returns
Day or the sweet approach of even or morn
Or sight of vernal bloom or summer rose
Or flocks or herds or human face divine
But cloud instead and ever-during dark
Surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men
Cut off and for the book of knowledge fair
Presented with a universal blank
Of nature works to me expung'd and ras'd
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out
So much the rather thou celestial Light
Shine inward and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence
Purge and disperse that I may see and tell
Of things invisible to mortal sight
Now had the Almighty Father from above
From the pure empyrean where he sits
High thron'd above all highth bent down his eye
His own works and their works at once to view
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
Stood thick as stars and from his sight receiv'd
Beatitude past utterance on his right
The radiant image of his glory sat
His only son on earth he first beheld
Our two first parents yet the only two
Of mankind in the happy garden plac'd
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love
Uninterrupted joy unrivall'd love
In blissful solitude he then survey'd
Hell and the gulf between and Satan there
Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night
In the dun air sublime and ready now
To stoop with wearied wings and willing feet
On the bare outside of this world that seem'd
Firm land imbosom'd without firmament
Uncertain which in ocean or in air
Him God beholding from his prospect high
Wherein past present future he beholds
Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake
Only begotten Son seest thou what rage
Transports our Adversary whom no bounds
Prescrib'd no bars of Hell nor all the chains
Heap'd on him there nor yet the main abyss
Wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems
On desperate revenge that shall redound
Upon his own rebellious head And now
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
Not far off Heaven in the precincts of light
Directly towards the new created world
And man there plac'd with purpose to assay
If him by force he can destroy or worse
By some false guile pervert and shall pervert
For man will hearken to his glozing lies
And easily transgress the sole command
Sole pledge of his obedience So will fall
He and his faithless progeny Whose fault
Whose but his own ingrate he had of me
All he could have I made him just and right
Sufficient to have stood though free to fall
Such I created all the ethereal Powers
And Spirits both them who stood and them who fail'd
Freely they stood who stood and fell who fell
Not free what proof could they have given sincere
Of true allegiance constant faith or love
Where only what they needs must do appear'd
Not what they would what praise could they receive
What pleasure I from such obedience paid
When will and reason reason also is choice
Useless and vain of freedom both despoil'd
Made passive both had serv'd necessity
Not me They therefore as to right belong'd
So were created nor can justly accuse
Their Maker or their making or their fate
As if predestination over-rul'd
Their will dispos'd by absolute decree
Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
Their own revolt not I if I foreknew
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault
Which had no less proved certain unforeknown
So without least impulse or shadow of fate
Or aught by me immutably foreseen
They trespass authors to themselves in all
Both what they judge and what they choose for so
I form'd them free and free they must remain
Till they enthrall themselves I else must change
Their nature and revoke the high decree
Unchangeable eternal which ordain'd
Their freedom they themselves ordain'd their fall
The first sort by their own suggestion fell
Self-tempted self-deprav'd Man falls deceiv'd
By the other first Man therefore shall find grace
The other none In mercy and justice both
Through Heaven and Earth so shall my glory excel
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine
Thus while God spake ambrosial fragrance fill'd
All Heaven and in the blessed Spirits elect
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
Most glorious in him all his Father shone
Substantially express'd and in his face
Divine compassion visibly appear'd
Love without end and without measure grace
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake
O Father gracious was that word which clos'd
Thy sovran command that Man should find grace
For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol
Thy praises with the innumerable sound
Of hymns and sacred songs wherewith thy throne
Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest
For should Man finally be lost should Man
Thy creature late so lov'd thy youngest son
Fall circumvented thus by fraud though join'd
With his own folly that be from thee far
That far be from thee Father who art judge
Of all things made and judgest only right
Or shall the Adversary thus obtain
His end and frustrate thine shall he fulfill
His malice and thy goodness bring to nought
Or proud return though to his heavier doom
Yet with revenge accomplish'd and to Hell
Draw after him the whole race of mankind
By him corrupted or wilt thou thyself
Abolish thy creation and unmake
For him what for thy glory thou hast made
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
Be question'd and blasphem'd without defence
To whom the great Creator thus replied
O son in whom my soul hath chief delight
Son of my bosom Son who art alone
My word my wisdom and effectual might
All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are all
As my eternal purpose hath decreed
Man shall not quite be lost but sav'd who will
Yet not of will in him but grace in me
Freely vouchsaf'd once more I will renew
His lapsed powers though forfeit and enthrall'd
By sin to foul exorbitant desires
Upheld by me yet once more he shall stand
On even ground against his mortal foe
By me upheld that he may know how frail
His fallen condition is and to me owe
All his deliverance and to none but me
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace
Elect above the rest so is my will
The rest shall hear me call and oft be warn'd
Their sinful state and to appease betimes
The incensed Deity while offer'd grace
Invites for I will clear their senses dark
What may suffice and soften stony hearts
To pray repent and bring obedience due
To prayer repentance and obedience due
Though but endeavour'd with sincere intent
Mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut
And I will place within them as a guide
My umpire Conscience whom if they will hear
Light after light well us'd they shall attain
And to the end persisting safe arrive
This my long sufferance and my day of grace
They who neglect and scorn shall never taste
But hard be harden'd blind be blinded more
That they may stumble on and deeper fall
And none but such from mercy I exclude
But yet all is not done Man disobeying
Disloyal breaks his fealty and sins
Against the high supremacy of Heaven
Affecting God-head and so losing all
To expiate his treason hath nought left
But to destruction sacred and devote
He with his whole posterity must die
Die he or justice must unless for him
Some other able and as willing pay
The rigid satisfaction death for death
Say heavenly Powers where shall we find such love
Which of you will be mortal to redeem
Man mortal crime and just the unjust to save
Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear
He ask'd but all the heavenly quire stood mute
And silence was in Heaven on Man behalf
Patron or intercessour none appear'd
Much less that durst upon his own head draw
The deadly forfeiture and ransom set
And now without redemption all mankind
Must have been lost adjudg'd to Death and Hell
By doom severe had not the Son of God
In whom the fulness dwells of love divine
His dearest mediation thus renew'd
Father thy word is past Man shall find grace
And shall grace not find means that finds her way
The speediest of thy winged messengers
To visit all thy creatures and to all
Comes unprevented unimplor'd unsought
Happy for Man so coming he her aid
Can never seek once dead in sins and lost
Atonement for himself or offering meet
Indebted and undone hath none to bring
Behold me then me for him life for life
I offer on me let thine anger fall
Account me Man I for his sake will leave
Thy bosom and this glory next to thee
Freely put off and for him lastly die
Well pleased on me let Death wreak all his rage
Under his gloomy power I shall not long
Lie vanquished Thou hast given me to possess
Life in myself for ever by thee I live
Though now to Death I yield and am his due
All that of me can die yet that debt paid
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave
His prey nor suffer my unspotted soul
For ever with corruption there to dwell
But I shall rise victorious and subdue
My vanquisher spoiled of his vaunted spoil
Death his death wound shall then receive and stoop
Inglorious of his mortal sting disarmed
I through the ample air in triumph high
Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell and show
The powers of darkness bound Thou at the sight
Pleased out of Heaven shalt look down and smile
While by thee raised I ruin all my foes
Death last and with his carcase glut the grave
Then with the multitude of my redeemed
Shall enter Heaven long absent and return
Father to see thy face wherein no cloud
Of anger shall remain but peace assured
And reconcilement wrath shall be no more
Thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire
His words here ended but his meek aspect
Silent yet spake and breathed immortal love
To mortal men above which only shone
Filial obedience as a sacrifice
Glad to be offered he attends the will
Of his great Father Admiration seized
All Heaven what this might mean and whither tend
Wondering but soon th' Almighty thus replied
O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace
Found out for mankind under wrath O thou
My sole complacence Well thou know'st how dear
To me are all my works nor Man the least
Though last created that for him I spare
Thee from my bosom and right hand to save
By losing thee a while the whole race lost
Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem
Their nature also to thy nature join
And be thyself Man among men on Earth
Made flesh when time shall be of virgin seed
By wondrous birth be thou in Adam room
The head of all mankind though Adam son
As in him perish all men so in thee
As from a second root shall be restored
As many as are restored without thee none
His crime makes guilty all his sons thy merit
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce
Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds
And live in thee transplanted and from thee
Receive new life So Man as is most just
Shall satisfy for Man be judged and die
And dying rise and rising with him raise
His brethren ransomed with his own dear life
So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate
Giving to death and dying to redeem
So dearly to redeem what hellish hate
So easily destroyed and still destroys
In those who when they may accept not grace
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume
Man nature lessen or degrade thine own
Because thou hast though throned in highest bliss
Equal to God and equally enjoying
God-like fruition quitted all to save
A world from utter loss and hast been found
By merit more than birthright Son of God
Found worthiest to be so by being good
Far more than great or high because in thee
Love hath abounded more than glory abounds
Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt
With thee thy manhood also to this throne
Here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign
Both God and Man Son both of God and Man
Anointed universal King all power
I give thee reign for ever and assume
Thy merits under thee as head supreme
Thrones Princedoms Powers Dominions I reduce
All knees to thee shall bow of them that bide
In Heaven or Earth or under Earth in Hell
When thou attended gloriously from Heaven
With joy and peace triumphing and fair truth
Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by
For regal scepter then no more shall need
God shall be all in all But all ye Gods
Adore him who to compass all this dies
Adore the Son and honour him as me
No sooner had the Almighty ceased but all
The multitude of Angels with a shout
Loud as from numbers without number sweet
As from blest voices uttering joy Heaven rung
With jubilee and loud Hosannas filled
The eternal regions Lowly reverent
Towards either throne they bow and to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold
Immortal amarant a flower which once
In Paradise fast by the tree of life
Began to bloom but soon for man offence
To Heaven removed where first it grew there grows
And flowers aloft shading the fount of life
And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven
Rolls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream
With these that never fade the Spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams
Now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright
Pavement that like a sea of jasper shone
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled
Then crowned again their golden harps they took
Harps ever tuned that glittering by their side
Like quivers hung and with preamble sweet
Of charming symphony they introduce
Their sacred song and waken raptures high
No voice exempt no voice but well could join
Melodious part such concord is in Heaven
Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent
Immutable Immortal Infinite
Eternal King the Author of all being
Fountain of light thyself invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st
Throned inaccessible but when thou shadest
The full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear
Yet dazzle Heaven that brightest Seraphim
Approach not but with both wings veil their eyes
Thee next they sang of all creation first
Begotten Son Divine Similitude
In whose conspicuous countenance without cloud
Made visible the Almighty Father shines
Whom else no creature can behold on thee
Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests
He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created and by thee threw down
The aspiring Dominations Thou that day
Thy Father dreadful thunder didst not spare
Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels that shook
Heaven everlasting frame while o'er the necks
Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
Thee only extolled Son of thy Father might
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes
Not so on Man Him through their malice fallen
Father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom
So strictly but much more to pity incline
No sooner did thy dear and only Son
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
So strictly but much more to pity inclined
He to appease thy wrath and end the strife
Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
Second to thee offered himself to die
For Man offence O unexampled love
Love no where to be found less than Divine
Hail Son of God Saviour of Men Thy name
Shall be the copious matter of my song
Henceforth and never shall my heart thy praise
Forget nor from thy Father praise disjoin
Thus they in Heaven above the starry sphere
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent
Mean while upon the firm opacous globe
Of this round world whose first convex divides
The luminous inferiour orbs enclosed
From Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old
Satan alighted walks A globe far off
It seemed now seems a boundless continent
Dark waste and wild under the frown of Night
Starless exposed and ever-threatening storms
Of Chaos blustering round inclement sky
Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven
Though distant far some small reflection gains
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field
As when a vultur on Imaus bred
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds
Dislodging from a region scarce of prey
To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids
On hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
Of Ganges or Hydaspes Indian streams
But in his way lights on the barren plains
Of Sericana where Chineses drive
With sails and wind their cany waggons light
So on this windy sea of land the Fiend
Walked up and down alone bent on his prey
Alone for other creature in this place
Living or lifeless to be found was none
None yet but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like aereal vapours flew
Of all things transitory and vain when sin
With vanity had filled the works of men
Both all things vain and all who in vain things
Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame
Or happiness in this or the other life
All who have their reward on earth the fruits
Of painful superstition and blind zeal
Nought seeking but the praise of men here find
Fit retribution empty as their deeds
All the unaccomplished works of Nature hand
Abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed
Dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain
Till final dissolution wander here
Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed
Those argent fields more likely habitants
Translated Saints or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt the angelical and human kind
Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born
First from the ancient world those giants came
With many a vain exploit though then renowned
The builders next of Babel on the plain
Of Sennaar and still with vain design
New Babels had they wherewithal would build
Others came single he who to be deemed
A God leaped fondly into Aetna flames
Empedocles and he who to enjoy
Plato Elysium leaped into the sea
Cleombrotus and many more too long
Embryos and idiots eremites and friars
White black and gray with all their trumpery
Here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek
In Golgotha him dead who lives in Heaven
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of Dominick
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised
They pass the planets seven and pass the fixed
And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
The trepidation talked and that first moved
And now Saint Peter at Heaven wicket seems
To wait them with his keys and now at foot
Of Heaven ascent they lift their feet when lo
A violent cross wind from either coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
Into the devious air Then might ye see
Cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost
And fluttered into rags then reliques beads
Indulgences dispenses pardons bulls
The sport of winds All these upwhirled aloft
Fly o'er the backside of the world far off
Into a Limbo large and broad since called
The Paradise of Fools to few unknown
Long after now unpeopled and untrod
All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed
And long he wandered till at last a gleam
Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste
His travelled steps far distant he descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high
At top whereof but far more rich appeared
The work as of a kingly palace-gate
With frontispiece of diamond and gold
Embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
The portal shone inimitable on earth
By model or by shading pencil drawn
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
Angels ascending and descending bands
Of guardians bright when he from Esau fled
To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz
Dreaming by night under the open sky
And waking cried This is the gate of Heaven
Each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
There always but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
Viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed
Of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
Who after came from earth failing arrived
Wafted by Angels or flew o'er the lake
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds
The stairs were then let down whether to dare
The Fiend by easy ascent or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss
Direct against which opened from beneath
Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise
A passage down to the Earth a passage wide
Wider by far than that of after-times
Over mount Sion and though that were large
Over the Promised Land to God so dear
By which to visit oft those happy tribes
On high behests his angels to and fro
Passed frequent and his eye with choice regard
From Paneas the fount of Jordan flood
To Beersaba where the Holy Land
Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore
So wide the opening seemed where bounds were set
To darkness such as bound the ocean wave
Satan from hence now on the lower stair
That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this world at once As when a scout
Through dark and desert ways with peril gone
All night at last by break of cheerful dawn
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some foreign land
First seen or some renowned metropolis
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams
Such wonder seised though after Heaven seen
The Spirit malign but much more envy seised
At sight of all this world beheld so fair
Round he surveys and well might where he stood
So high above the circling canopy
Of night extended shade from eastern point
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
Andromeda far off Atlantick seas
Beyond the horizon then from pole to pole
He views in breadth and without longer pause
Down right into the world first region throws
His flight precipitant and winds with ease
Through the pure marble air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable stars that shone
Stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds
Or other worlds they seemed or happy isles
Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old
Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales
Thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
He staid not to inquire Above them all
The golden sun in splendour likest Heaven
Allured his eye thither his course he bends
Through the calm firmament but up or down
By center or eccentrick hard to tell
Or longitude where the great luminary
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick
That from his lordly eye keep distance due
Dispenses light from far they as they move
Their starry dance in numbers that compute
Days months and years towards his all-cheering lamp
Turn swift their various motions or are turned
By his magnetick beam that gently warms
The universe and to each inward part
With gentle penetration though unseen
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep
So wonderously was set his station bright
There lands the Fiend a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the sun lucent orb
Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw
The place he found beyond expression bright
Compared with aught on earth metal or stone
Not all parts like but all alike informed
With radiant light as glowing iron with fire
If metal part seemed gold part silver clear
If stone carbuncle most or chrysolite
Ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone
In Aaron breast-plate and a stone besides
Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen
That stone or like to that which here below
Philosophers in vain so long have sought
In vain though by their powerful art they bind
Volatile Hermes and call up unbound
In various shapes old Proteus from the sea
Drained through a limbeck to his native form
What wonder then if fields and regions here
Breathe forth Elixir pure and rivers run
Potable gold when with one virtuous touch
The arch-chemick sun so far from us remote
Produces with terrestrial humour mixed
Here in the dark so many precious things
Of colour glorious and effect so rare
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
Undazzled far and wide his eye commands
For sight no obstacle found here nor shade
But all sun-shine as when his beams at noon
Culminate from the equator as they now
Shot upward still direct whence no way round
Shadow from body opaque can fall and the air
No where so clear sharpened his visual ray
To objects distant far whereby he soon
Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand
The same whom John saw also in the sun
His back was turned but not his brightness hid
Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
Circled his head nor less his locks behind
Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
Lay waving round on some great charge employed
He seemed or fixed in cogitation deep
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
To find who might direct his wandering flight
To Paradise the happy seat of Man
His journey end and our beginning woe
But first he casts to change his proper shape
Which else might work him danger or delay
And now a stripling Cherub he appears
Not of the prime yet such as in his face
Youth smiled celestial and to every limb
Suitable grace diffused so well he feigned
Under a coronet his flowing hair
In curls on either cheek played wings he wore
Of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold
His habit fit for speed succinct and held
Before his decent steps a silver wand
He drew not nigh unheard the Angel bright
Ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned
Admonished by his ear and straight was known
The Arch-Angel Uriel one of the seven
Who in God presence nearest to his throne
Stand ready at command and are his eyes
That run through all the Heavens or down to the Earth
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry
O'er sea and land him Satan thus accosts
Uriel for thou of those seven Spirits that stand
In sight of God high throne gloriously bright
The first art wont his great authentick will
Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring
Where all his sons thy embassy attend
And here art likeliest by supreme decree
Like honour to obtain and as his eye
To visit oft this new creation round
Unspeakable desire to see and know
All these his wonderous works but chiefly Man
His chief delight and favour him for whom
All these his works so wonderous he ordained
Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim
Alone thus wandering Brightest Seraph tell
In which of all these shining orbs hath Man
His fixed seat or fixed seat hath none
But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell
That I may find him and with secret gaze
Or open admiration him behold
On whom the great Creator hath bestowed
Worlds and on whom hath all these graces poured
That both in him and all things as is meet
The universal Maker we may praise
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
To deepest Hell and to repair that loss
Created this new happy race of Men
To serve him better Wise are all his ways
So spake the false dissembler unperceived
For neither Man nor Angel can discern
Hypocrisy the only evil that walks
Invisible except to God alone
By his permissive will through Heaven and Earth
And oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps
At wisdom gate and to simplicity
Resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill
Where no ill seems Which now for once beguiled
Uriel though regent of the sun and held
The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven
Who to the fraudulent impostor foul
In his uprightness answer thus returned
Fair Angel thy desire which tends to know
The works of God thereby to glorify
The great Work-master leads to no excess
That reaches blame but rather merits praise
The more it seems excess that led thee hither
From thy empyreal mansion thus alone
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
Contented with report hear only in Heaven
For wonderful indeed are all his works
Pleasant to know and worthiest to be all
Had in remembrance always with delight
But what created mind can comprehend
Their number or the wisdom infinite
That brought them forth but hid their causes deep
I saw when at his word the formless mass
This world material mould came to a heap
Confusion heard his voice and wild uproar
Stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined
Till at his second bidding Darkness fled
Light shone and order from disorder sprung
Swift to their several quarters hasted then
The cumbrous elements earth flood air fire
And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven
Flew upward spirited with various forms
That rolled orbicular and turned to stars
Numberless as thou seest and how they move
Each had his place appointed each his course
The rest in circuit walls this universe
Look downward on that globe whose hither side
With light from hence though but reflected shines
That place is Earth the seat of Man that light
His day which else as the other hemisphere
Night would invade but there the neighbouring moon
So call that opposite fair star her aid
Timely interposes and her monthly round
Still ending still renewing through mid Heaven
With borrowed light her countenance triform
O for that warning voice which he who saw
The Apocalypse heard cry in Heaven aloud
Then when the Dragon put to second rout
Came furious down to be revenged on men
Woe to the inhabitants on earth that now
While time was our first parents had been warned
The coming of their secret foe and 'scaped
Haply so 'scaped his mortal snare For now
Satan now first inflamed with rage came down
The tempter ere the accuser of mankind
To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss
Of that first battle and his flight to Hell
Yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold
Far off and fearless nor with cause to boast
Begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth
Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast
And like a devilish engine back recoils
Upon himself horrour and doubt distract
His troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir
The Hell within him for within him Hell
He brings and round about him nor from Hell
One step no more than from himself can fly
By change of place Now conscience wakes despair
That slumbered wakes the bitter memory
Of what he was what is and what must be
Worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue
Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view
Lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad
Sometimes towards Heaven and the full-blazing sun
Which now sat high in his meridian tower
Then much revolving thus in sighs began
O thou that with surpassing glory crowned
Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God
Of this new world at whose sight all the stars
Hide their diminished heads to thee I call
But with no friendly voice and add thy name
Of Sun to tell thee how I hate thy beams
That bring to my remembrance from what state
I fell how glorious once above thy sphere
Till pride and worse ambition threw me down
Warring in Heaven against Heaven matchless King
Ah wherefore he deserved no such return
From me whom he created what I was
In that bright eminence and with his good
Upbraided none nor was his service hard
What could be less than to afford him praise
The easiest recompence and pay him thanks
How due yet all his good proved ill in me
And wrought but malice lifted up so high
I 'sdeined subjection and thought one step higher
Would set me highest and in a moment quit
The debt immense of endless gratitude
So burdensome still paying still to owe
Forgetful what from him I still received
And understood not that a grateful mind
By owing owes not but still pays at once
Indebted and discharged what burden then
O had his powerful destiny ordained
Me some inferiour Angel I had stood
Then happy no unbounded hope had raised
Ambition Yet why not some other Power
As great might have aspired and me though mean
Drawn to his part but other Powers as great
Fell not but stand unshaken from within
Or from without to all temptations armed
Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand
Thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse
But Heaven free love dealt equally to all
Be then his love accursed since love or hate
To me alike it deals eternal woe
Nay cursed be thou since against his thy will
Chose freely what it now so justly rues
Me miserable which way shall I fly
Infinite wrath and infinite despair
Which way I fly is Hell myself am Hell
And in the lowest deep a lower deep
Still threatening to devour me opens wide
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven
O then at last relent Is there no place
Left for repentance none for pardon left
None left but by submission and that word
Disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
Among the Spirits beneath whom I seduced
With other promises and other vaunts
Than to submit boasting I could subdue
The Omnipotent Ay me they little know
How dearly I abide that boast so vain
Upon the rapid current which through veins
Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn
Rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
Watered the garden thence united fell
Down the steep glade and met the nether flood
Which from his darksome passage now appears
And now divided into four main streams
Runs diverse wandering many a famous realm
And country whereof here needs no account
But rather to tell how if Art could tell
How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks
Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold
With mazy errour under pendant shades
Ran nectar visiting each plant and fed
Flowers worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
In beds and curious knots but Nature boon
Poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain
Both where the morning sun first warmly smote
The open field and where the unpierced shade
Imbrowned the noontide bowers Thus was this place
A happy rural seat of various view
Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm
Others whose fruit burnished with golden rind
Hung amiable Hesperian fables true
If true here only and of delicious taste
Betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks
Grazing the tender herb were interposed
Or palmy hillock or the flowery lap
Of some irriguous valley spread her store
Flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose
Another side umbrageous grots and caves
Of cool recess o'er which the mantling vine
Lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps
Luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall
Down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake
That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
Her crystal mirrour holds unite their streams
The birds their quire apply airs vernal airs
Breathing the smell of field and grove attune
The trembling leaves while universal Pan
Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance
Led on the eternal Spring Not that fair field
Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers
Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis
Was gathered which cost Ceres all that pain
To seek her through the world nor that sweet grove
Of Daphne by Orontes and the inspired
Castalian spring might with this Paradise
Of Eden strive nor that Nyseian isle
Girt with the river Triton where old Cham
Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove
Hid Amalthea and her florid son
Young Bacchus from his stepdame Rhea eye
Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard
Mount Amara though this by some supposed
True Paradise under the Ethiop line
By Nilus' head enclosed with shining rock
A whole day journey high but wide remote
From this Assyrian garden where the Fiend
Saw undelighted all delight all kind
Of living creatures new to sight and strange
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall
Godlike erect with native honour clad
In naked majesty seemed lords of all
And worthy seemed for in their looks divine
The image of their glorious Maker shone
Truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure
Severe but in true filial freedom placed
Whence true authority in men though both
Not equal as their sex not equal seemed
For contemplation he and valour formed
For softness she and sweet attractive grace
He for God only she for God in him
His fair large front and eye sublime declared
Absolute rule and hyacinthine locks
Round from his parted forelock manly hung
Clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad
She as a veil down to the slender waist
Her unadorned golden tresses wore
Dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved
As the vine curls her tendrils which implied
Subjection but required with gentle sway
And by her yielded by him best received
Yielded with coy submission modest pride
And sweet reluctant amorous delay
Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed
Then was not guilty shame dishonest shame
Of nature works honour dishonourable
Sin-bred how have ye troubled all mankind
With shows instead mere shows of seeming pure
And banished from man life his happiest life
Simplicity and spotless innocence
So passed they naked on nor shunned the sight
Of God or Angel for they thought no ill
So hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair
That ever since in love embraces met
Adam the goodliest man of men since born
His sons the fairest of her daughters Eve
Under a tuft of shade that on a green
Stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side
They sat them down and after no more toil
Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed
To recommend cool Zephyr and made ease
More easy wholesome thirst and appetite
More grateful to their supper-fruits they fell
Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
Yielded them side-long as they sat recline
On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers
The savoury pulp they chew and in the rind
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream
Nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles
Wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems
Fair couple linked in happy nuptial league
Alone as they About them frisking played
All beasts of the earth since wild and of all chase
Or in thick shade retired from him to draw
What further would be learned Live while ye may
Yet happy pair enjoy till I return
Short pleasures for long woes are to succeed
So saying his proud step he scornful turned
But with sly circumspection and began
Through wood through waste o'er hill o'er dale his roam
Mean while in utmost longitude where Heaven
With earth and ocean meets the setting sun
Slowly descended and with right aspect
Against the eastern gate of Paradise
Levelled his evening rays It was a rock
Of alabaster piled up to the clouds
Conspicuous far winding with one ascent
Accessible from earth one entrance high
The rest was craggy cliff that overhung
Still as it rose impossible to climb
Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat
Chief of the angelick guards awaiting night
About him exercised heroick games
The unarmed youth of Heaven but nigh at hand
Celestial armoury shields helms and spears
Hung high with diamond flaming and with gold
Thither came Uriel gliding through the even
On a sun-beam swift as a shooting star
In autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired
Impress the air and shows the mariner
From what point of his compass to beware
Impetuous winds He thus began in haste
Gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given
Charge and strict watch that to this happy place
No evil thing approach or enter in
This day at highth of noon came to my sphere
A Spirit zealous as he seemed to know
More of the Almighty works and chiefly Man
God latest image I described his way
Bent all on speed and marked his aery gait
But in the mount that lies from Eden north
Where he first lighted soon discerned his looks
Alien from Heaven with passions foul obscured
Mine eye pursued him still but under shade
Lost sight of him One of the banished crew
I fear hath ventured from the deep to raise
New troubles him thy care must be to find
To whom the winged warriour thus returned
Uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight
Amid the sun bright circle where thou sitst
See far and wide In at this gate none pass
The vigilance here placed but such as come
Well known from Heaven and since meridian hour
No creature thence If Spirit of other sort
So minded have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds
On purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude
Spiritual substance with corporeal bar
But if within the circuit of these walks
In whatsoever shape he lurk of whom
Thou tellest by morrow dawning I shall know
So promised he and Uriel to his charge
Returned on that bright beam whose point now raised
Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
Beneath the Azores whether the prime orb
Incredible how swift had thither rolled
Diurnal or this less volubil earth
By shorter flight to the east had left him there
Arraying with reflected purple and gold
The clouds that on his western throne attend
Now came still Evening on and Twilight gray
Had in her sober livery all things clad
Silence accompanied for beast and bird
They to their grassy couch these to their nests
Were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale
She all night long her amorous descant sung
Silence was pleased Now glowed the firmament
With living sapphires Hesperus that led
The starry host rode brightest till the moon
Rising in clouded majesty at length
Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light
And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw
When Adam thus to Eve Fair Consort the hour
Of night and all things now retired to rest
Mind us of like repose since God hath set
Labour and rest as day and night to men
Successive and the timely dew of sleep
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
Our eye-lids Other creatures all day long
Rove idle unemployed and less need rest
Man hath his daily work of body or mind
Appointed which declares his dignity
And the regard of Heaven on all his ways
While other animals unactive range
And of their doings God takes no account
To-morrow ere fresh morning streak the east
With first approach of light we must be risen
And at our pleasant labour to reform
Yon flowery arbours yonder alleys green
Our walk at noon with branches overgrown
That mock our scant manuring and require
More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth
Those blossoms also and those dropping gums
That lie bestrown unsightly and unsmooth
Ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease
Mean while as Nature wills night bids us rest
To whom thus Eve with perfect beauty adorned
My Author and Disposer what thou bidst
Unargued I obey So God ordains
God is thy law thou mine To know no more
Is woman happiest knowledge and her praise
With thee conversing I forget all time
All seasons and their change all please alike
Sweet is the breath of Morn her rising sweet
With charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun
When first on this delightful land he spreads
His orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower
Glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth
After soft showers and sweet the coming on
Of grateful Evening mild then silent Night
With this her solemn bird and this fair moon
And these the gems of Heaven her starry train
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends
With charm of earliest birds nor rising sun
On this delightful land nor herb fruit flower
Glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers
Nor grateful Evening mild nor silent Night
With this her solemn bird nor walk by moon
Or glittering star-light without thee is sweet
But wherefore all night long shine these for whom
This glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes
To whom our general ancestor replied
Daughter of God and Man accomplished Eve
These have their course to finish round the earth
By morrow evening and from land to land
In order though to nations yet unborn
Ministring light prepared they set and rise
Lest total Darkness should by night regain
Her old possession and extinguish life
In Nature and all things which these soft fires
Not only enlighten but with kindly heat
Of various influence foment and warm
Temper or nourish or in part shed down
Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
On earth made hereby apter to receive
Perfection from the sun more potent ray
These then though unbeheld in deep of night
Shine not in vain nor think though men were none
That Heaven would want spectators God want praise
Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
Unseen both when we wake and when we sleep
All these with ceaseless praise his works behold
Both day and night How often from the steep
Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
Celestial voices to the midnight air
Sole or responsive each to others note
Singing their great Creator oft in bands
While they keep watch or nightly rounding walk
With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
In full harmonick number joined their songs
Divide the night and lift our thoughts to Heaven
Thus talking hand in hand alone they passed
On to their blissful bower it was a place
Chosen by the sovran Planter when he framed
All things to Man delightful use the roof
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
Laurel and myrtle and what higher grew
Of firm and fragrant leaf on either side
Acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub
Fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower
Iris all hues roses and jessamin
Reared high their flourished heads between and wrought
Mosaick underfoot the violet
Crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay
Broidered the ground more coloured than with stone
Of costliest emblem Other creature here
Bird beast insect or worm durst enter none
Such was their awe of Man In shadier bower
More sacred and sequestered though but feigned
Pan or Sylvanus never slept nor Nymph
Nor Faunus haunted Here in close recess
With flowers garlands and sweet-smelling herbs
Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed
And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung
What day the genial Angel to our sire
Brought her in naked beauty more adorned
More lovely than Pandora whom the Gods
Endowed with all their gifts and O too like
In sad event when to the unwiser son
Of Japhet brought by Hermes she ensnared
Mankind with her fair looks to be avenged
On him who had stole Jove authentick fire
Thus at their shady lodge arrived both stood
Both turned and under open sky adored
The God that made both sky air earth and heaven
Which they beheld the moon resplendent globe
And starry pole Thou also madest the night
Maker Omnipotent and thou the day
Which we in our appointed work employed
Have finished happy in our mutual help
And mutual love the crown of all our bliss
Ordained by thee and this delicious place
For us too large where thy abundance wants
Partakers and uncropt falls to the ground
But thou hast promised from us two a race
To fill the earth who shall with us extol
Thy goodness infinite both when we wake
And when we seek as now thy gift of sleep
This said unanimous and other rites
Observing none but adoration pure
Which God likes best into their inmost bower
Handed they went and eased the putting off
These troublesome disguises which we wear
Straight side by side were laid nor turned I ween
Adam from his fair spouse nor Eve the rites
Mysterious of connubial love refused
Whatever hypocrites austerely talk
Of purity and place and innocence
Defaming as impure what God declares
Pure and commands to some leaves free to all
Our Maker bids encrease who bids abstain
But our Destroyer foe to God and Man
Hail wedded Love mysterious law true source
Of human offspring sole propriety
In Paradise of all things common else
By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men
Among the bestial herds to range by thee
Founded in reason loyal just and pure
Relations dear and all the charities
Of father son and brother first were known
Far be it that I should write thee sin or blame
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place
Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets
And brief related whom they brought where found
How busied in what form and posture couched
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake
Why hast thou Satan broke the bounds prescribed
To thy transgressions and disturbed the charge
Of others who approve not to transgress
By thy example but have power and right
To question thy bold entrance on this place
Employed it seems to violate sleep and those
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss
To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow
Gabriel thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise
And such I held thee but this question asked
Puts me in doubt Lives there who loves his pain
Who would not finding way break loose from Hell
Though thither doomed Thou wouldst thyself no doubt
And boldly venture to whatever place
Farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
Torment with ease and soonest recompense
Dole with delight which in this place I sought
To thee no reason who knowest only good
But evil hast not tried and wilt object
His will who bounds us Let him surer bar
His iron gates if he intends our stay
In that dark durance Thus much what was asked
The rest is true they found me where they say
But that implies not violence or harm
Thus he in scorn The warlike Angel moved
Disdainfully half smiling thus replied
O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise
Since Satan fell whom folly overthrew
And now returns him from his prison 'scaped
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
Or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed
So wise he judges it to fly from pain
However and to 'scape his punishment
So judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath
Which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight
Sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to Hell
Which taught thee yet no better that no pain
Can equal anger infinite provoked
But wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee
Came not all hell broke loose or thou than they
Less hardy to endure Courageous Chief
The first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged
To thy deserted host this cause of flight
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive
To which the Fiend thus answered frowning stern
Not that I less endure or shrink from pain
Insulting Angel well thou knowest I stood
Thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid
The blasting vollied thunder made all speed
And seconded thy else not dreaded spear
But still thy words at random as before
Argue thy inexperience what behoves
From hard assays and ill successes past
A faithful leader not to hazard all
Through ways of danger by himself untried
I therefore I alone first undertook
To wing the desolate abyss and spy
This new created world whereof in Hell
Fame is not silent here in hope to find
Better abode and my afflicted Powers
To settle here on earth or in mid air
Though for possession put to try once more
What thou and thy gay legions dare against
Whose easier business were to serve their Lord
High up in Heaven with songs to hymn his throne
And practised distances to cringe not fight
To whom the warriour Angel soon replied
To say and straight unsay pretending first
Wise to fly pain professing next the spy
Argues no leader but a liar traced
Satan and couldst thou faithful add O name
O sacred name of faithfulness profaned
Faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew
Army of Fiends fit body to fit head
Was this your discipline and faith engaged
Your military obedience to dissolve
Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme
And thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
Patron of liberty who more than thou
Once fawned and cringed and servilely adored
Heaven awful Monarch wherefore but in hope
To dispossess him and thyself to reign
But mark what I arreed thee now Avant
Fly neither whence thou fledst If from this hour
Within these hallowed limits thou appear
Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained
And seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn
The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred
So threatened he but Satan to no threats
Gave heed but waxing more in rage replied
Then when I am thy captive talk of chains
Proud limitary Cherub but ere then
Far heavier load thyself expect to feel
From my prevailing arm though Heaven King
Ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers
Us'd to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels
In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved
While thus he spake the angelick squadron bright
Turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns
Their phalanx and began to hem him round
With ported spears as thick as when a field
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
Her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
Sways them the careful plowman doubting stands
Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
Prove chaff On the other side Satan alarmed
Collecting all his might dilated stood
Related and thus Adam answered sad
Best image of myself and dearer half
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
Affects me equally nor can I like
This uncouth dream of evil sprung I fear
Yet evil whence in thee can harbour none
Created pure But know that in the soul
Are many lesser faculties that serve
Reason as chief among these Fancy next
Her office holds of all external things
Which the five watchful senses represent
She forms imaginations aery shapes
Which Reason joining or disjoining frames
All what we affirm or what deny and call
Our knowledge or opinion then retires
Into her private cell when nature rests
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes
To imitate her but misjoining shapes
Wild work produces oft and most in dreams
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late
Some such resemblances methinks I find
Of our last evening talk in this thy dream
But with addition strange yet be not sad
Evil into the mind of God or Man
May come and go so unreproved and leave
No spot or blame behind Which gives me hope
That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream
Waking thou never will consent to do
Be not disheartened then nor cloud those looks
That wont to be more cheerful and serene
Than when fair morning first smiles on the world
And let us to our fresh employments rise
Among the groves the fountains and the flowers
That open now their choisest bosomed smells
Reserved from night and kept for thee in store
So cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered
But silently a gentle tear let fall
From either eye and wiped them with her hair
Two other precious drops that ready stood
Each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell
Kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
And pious awe that feared to have offended
So all was cleared and to the field they haste
But first from under shady arborous roof
Soon as they forth were come to open sight
Of day-spring and the sun who scarce up-risen
With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim
Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray
Discovering in wide landskip all the east
Of Paradise and Eden happy plains
Lowly they bowed adoring and began
Their orisons each morning duly paid
In various style for neither various style
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
Their Maker in fit strains pronounced or sung
Unmeditated such prompt eloquence
Flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse
More tuneable than needed lute or harp
To add more sweetness and they thus began
These are thy glorious works Parent of good
Almighty Thine this universal frame
Thus wonderous fair Thyself how wonderous then
Unspeakable who sitst above these heavens
To us invisible or dimly seen
In these thy lowest works yet these declare
Thy goodness beyond thought and power divine
Speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light
Angels for ye behold him and with songs
And choral symphonies day without night
Circle his throne rejoicing ye in Heaven
On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol
Him first him last him midst and without end
Fairest of stars last in the train of night
If better thou belong not to the dawn
Sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn
With thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere
While day arises that sweet hour of prime
Thou Sun of this great world both eye and soul
Acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise
In thy eternal course both when thou climbest
And when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest
Moon that now meetest the orient sun now flyest
With the fixed Stars fixed in their orb that flies
And ye five other wandering Fires that move
In mystick dance not without song resound
His praise who out of darkness called up light
Air and ye Elements the eldest birth
Of Nature womb that in quaternion run
Perpetual circle multiform and mix
And nourish all things let your ceaseless change
Vary to our great Maker still new praise
Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise
From hill or steaming lake dusky or gray
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold
In honour to the world great Author rise
Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers
Rising or falling still advance his praise
His praise ye Winds that from four quarters blow
Breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye Pines
With every plant in sign of worship wave
Fountains and ye that warble as ye flow
Melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise
Join voices all ye living Souls Ye Birds
That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise
Ye that in waters glide and ye that walk
The earth and stately tread or lowly creep
Witness if I be silent morn or even
To hill or valley fountain or fresh shade
Made vocal by my song and taught his praise
Hail universal Lord be bounteous still
To give us only good and if the night
Have gathered aught of evil or concealed
Disperse it as now light dispels the dark
So prayed they innocent and to their thoughts
Firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm
On to their morning rural work they haste
Among sweet dews and flowers where any row
Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far
Their pampered boughs and needed hands to check
Fruitless embraces or they led the vine
To wed her elm she spoused about him twines
Her marriageable arms and with him brings
Her dower the adopted clusters to adorn
His barren leaves Them thus employed beheld
With pity Heaven high King and to him called
Raphael the sociable Spirit that deigned
To travel with Tobias and secured
His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid
Raphael said he thou hearest what stir on Earth
Satan from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf
Hath raised in Paradise and how disturbed
This night the human pair how he designs
In them at once to ruin all mankind
Go therefore half this day as friend with friend
Converse with Adam in what bower or shade
Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired
To respite his day-labour with repast
Or with repose and such discourse bring on
As may advise him of his happy state
Happiness in his power left free to will
Left to his own free will his will though free
Yet mutable whence warn him to beware
He swerve not too secure Tell him withal
His danger and from whom what enemy
Late fallen himself from Heaven is plotting now
The fall of others from like state of bliss
By violence no for that shall be withstood
But by deceit and lies This let him know
Lest wilfully transgressing he pretend
Surprisal unadmonished unforewarned
So spake the Eternal Father and fulfilled
All justice Nor delayed the winged Saint
After his charge received but from among
Thousand celestial Ardours where he stood
Veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light
Flew through the midst of Heaven the angelick quires
On each hand parting to his speed gave way
Through all the empyreal road till at the gate
Of Heaven arrived the gate self-opened wide
On golden hinges turning as by work
Divine the sovran Architect had framed
From hence no cloud or to obstruct his sight
Star interposed however small he sees
Not unconformed to other shining globes
Earth and the garden of God with cedars crowned
Above all hills As when by night the glass
Of Galileo less assured observes
Imagined lands and regions in the moon
Or pilot from amidst the Cyclades
Delos or Samos first appearing kens
A cloudy spot Down thither prone in flight
He speeds and through the vast ethereal sky
Sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing
Now on the polar winds then with quick fan
Winnows the buxom air till within soar
Of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems
A phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird
When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's
Bright temple to Egyptian Thebes he flies
At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise
He lights and to his proper shape returns
A Seraph winged Six wings he wore to shade
His lineaments divine the pair that clad
Each shoulder broad came mantling o'er his breast
With regal ornament the middle pair
Girt like a starry zone his waist and round
Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold
And colours dipt in Heaven the third his feet
Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail
Sky-tinctured grain Like Maia son he stood
And shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled
The circuit wide Straight knew him all the bands
Of Angels under watch and to his state
Within them every lower faculty
Of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste
Tasting concoct digest assimilate
And corporeal to incorporeal turn
For know whatever was created needs
To be sustained and fed Of elements
The grosser feeds the purer earth the sea
Earth and the sea feed air the air those fires
Ethereal and as lowest first the moon
Whence in her visage round those spots unpurged
Vapours not yet into her substance turned
Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale
From her moist continent to higher orbs
The sun that light imparts to all receives
From all his alimental recompence
In humid exhalations and at even
Sups with the ocean Though in Heaven the trees
Of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines
Yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn
We brush mellifluous dews and find the ground
Covered with pearly grain Yet God hath here
Varied his bounty so with new delights
As may compare with Heaven and to taste
Think not I shall be nice So down they sat
And to their viands fell nor seemingly
The Angel nor in mist the common gloss
Of Theologians but with keen dispatch
Of real hunger and concoctive heat
To transubstantiate What redounds transpires
Through Spirits with ease nor wonder if by fire
Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist
Can turn or holds it possible to turn
Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold
As from the mine Mean while at table Eve
Ministered naked and their flowing cups
With pleasant liquours crowned O innocence
Deserving Paradise if ever then
Then had the sons of God excuse to have been
Enamoured at that sight but in those hearts
Love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy
Was understood the injured lover hell
Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed
Not burdened nature sudden mind arose
In Adam not to let the occasion pass
Given him by this great conference to know
Of things above his world and of their being
Who dwell in Heaven whose excellence he saw
Transcend his own so far whose radiant forms
Divine effulgence whose high power so far
Exceeded human and his wary speech
Thus to the empyreal minister he framed
Inhabitant with God now know I well
Thy favour in this honour done to Man
Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed
To enter and these earthly fruits to taste
Food not of Angels yet accepted so
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem
At Heaven high feasts to have fed yet what compare
To whom the winged Hierarch replied
O Adam One Almighty is from whom
All things proceed and up to him return
If not depraved from good created all
Such to perfection one first matter all
Endued with various forms various degrees
Of substance and in things that live of life
But more refined more spiritous and pure
As nearer to him placed or nearer tending
Each in their several active spheres assigned
Till body up to spirit work in bounds
Proportioned to each kind So from the root
Springs lighter the green stalk from thence the leaves
More aery last the bright consummate flower
Spirits odorous breathes flowers and their fruit
Man nourishment by gradual scale sublimed
To vital spirits aspire to animal
To intellectual give both life and sense
Fancy and understanding whence the soul
Reason receives and reason is her being
Discursive or intuitive discourse
Is oftest yours the latter most is ours
Differing but in degree of kind the same
Wonder not then what God for you saw good
If I refuse not but convert as you
To proper substance Time may come when Men
With Angels may participate and find
No inconvenient diet nor too light fare
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit
Improved by tract of time and winged ascend
Ethereal as we or may at choice
Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell
If ye be found obedient and retain
Unalterably firm his love entire
Whose progeny you are Mean while enjoy
Your fill what happiness this happy state
Can comprehend incapable of more
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied
O favourable Spirit propitious guest
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
Our knowledge and the scale of nature set
From center to circumference whereon
In contemplation of created things
By steps we may ascend to God But say
What meant that caution joined If ye be found
Obedient Can we want obedience then
To him or possibly his love desert
Who formed us from the dust and placed us here
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss
Human desires can seek or apprehend
To whom the Angel Son of Heaven and Earth
Attend That thou art happy owe to God
That thou continuest such owe to thyself
That is to thy obedience therein stand
This was that caution given thee be advised
God made thee perfect not immutable
And good he made thee but to persevere
He left it in thy power ordained thy will
By nature free not over-ruled by fate
Inextricable or strict necessity
Our voluntary service he requires
Not our necessitated such with him
Finds no acceptance nor can find for how
Can hearts not free be tried whether they serve
Willing or no who will but what they must
By destiny and can no other choose
Myself and all the angelick host that stand
In sight of God enthroned our happy state
Hold as you yours while our obedience holds
On other surety none Freely we serve
Because we freely love as in our will
To love or not in this we stand or fall
And some are fallen to disobedience fallen
And so from Heaven to deepest Hell O fall
From what high state of bliss into what woe
To whom our great progenitor Thy words
Attentive and with more delighted ear
Divine instructer I have heard than when
Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills
Aereal musick send Nor knew I not
To be both will and deed created free
Yet that we never shall forget to love
Our Maker and obey him whose command
Single is yet so just my constant thoughts
Assured me and still assure Though what thou tellest
Hath passed in Heaven some doubt within me move
But more desire to hear if thou consent
The full relation which must needs be strange
Worthy of sacred silence to be heard
And we have yet large day for scarce the sun
Hath finished half his journey and scarce begins
His other half in the great zone of Heaven
Thus Adam made request and Raphael
After short pause assenting thus began
High matter thou enjoinest me O prime of men
Sad task and hard For how shall I relate
To human sense the invisible exploits
Of warring Spirits how without remorse
The ruin of so many glorious once
And perfect while they stood how last unfold
The secrets of another world perhaps
Not lawful to reveal yet for thy good
This is dispensed and what surmounts the reach
Of human sense I shall delineate so
By likening spiritual to corporal forms
As may express them best though what if Earth
Be but a shadow of Heaven and things therein
Each to other like more than on earth is thought
As yet this world was not and Chaos wild
Reigned where these Heavens now roll where Earth now rests
Upon her center poised when on a day
For time though in eternity applied
To motion measures all things durable
By present past and future on such day
As Heaven great year brings forth the empyreal host
Of Angels by imperial summons called
Innumerable before the Almighty throne
Forthwith from all the ends of Heaven appeared
Under their Hierarchs in orders bright
Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced
Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear
Stream in the air and for distinction serve
Of hierarchies of orders and degrees
Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed
Holy memorials acts of zeal and love
Recorded eminent Thus when in orbs
Of circuit inexpressible they stood
Orb within orb the Father Infinite
By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son
Amidst as from a flaming mount whose top
Brightness had made invisible thus spake
Hear all ye Angels progeny of light
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
Hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand
This day I have begot whom I declare
My only Son and on this holy hill
Him have anointed whom ye now behold
At my right hand your head I him appoint
And by myself have sworn to him shall bow
All knees in Heaven and shall confess him Lord
Under his great vice-gerent reign abide
United as one individual soul
For ever happy Him who disobeys
Me disobeys breaks union and that day
Cast out from God and blessed vision falls
Into utter darkness deep ingulfed his place
Ordained without redemption without end
So spake the Omnipotent and with his words
All seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all
That day as other solemn days they spent
In song and dance about the sacred hill
Mystical dance which yonder starry sphere
Of planets and of fixed in all her wheels
Resembles nearest mazes intricate
Eccentrick intervolved yet regular
Then most when most irregular they seem
And in their motions harmony divine
So smooths her charming tones that God own ear
Listens delighted Evening now approached
For we have also our evening and our morn
We ours for change delectable not need
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
Desirous all in circles as they stood
Tables are set and on a sudden piled
With Angels food and rubied nectar flows
In pearl in diamond and massy gold
Fruit of delicious vines the growth of Heaven
On flowers reposed and with fresh flowerets crowned
They eat they drink and in communion sweet
Quaff immortality and joy secure
Of surfeit where full measure only bounds
Excess before the all-bounteous King who showered
With copious hand rejoicing in their joy
Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled
From that high mount of God whence light and shade
Spring both the face of brightest Heaven had changed
To grateful twilight for night comes not there
In darker veil and roseate dews disposed
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest
Wide over all the plain and wider far
Than all this globous earth in plain outspread
Such are the courts of God the angelick throng
Dispersed in bands and files their camp extend
By living streams among the trees of life
Pavilions numberless and sudden reared
Celestial tabernacles where they slept
Fanned with cool winds save those who in their course
Melodious hymns about the sovran throne
Alternate all night long but not so waked
Satan so call him now his former name
Is heard no more in Heaven he of the first
If not the first Arch-Angel great in power
In favour and pre-eminence yet fraught
With envy against the Son of God that day
Honoured by his great Father and proclaimed
Messiah King anointed could not bear
Through pride that sight and thought himself impaired
Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain
Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour
Friendliest to sleep and silence he resolved
With all his legions to dislodge and leave
Unworshipt unobeyed the throne supreme
Contemptuous and his next subordinate
Awakening thus to him in secret spake
Sleepest thou Companion dear What sleep can close
Thy eye-lids and rememberest what decree
Of yesterday so late hath passed the lips
Of Heaven Almighty Thou to me thy thoughts
Wast wont I mine to thee was wont to impart
Both waking we were one how then can now
Thy sleep dissent New laws thou seest imposed
New laws from him who reigns new minds may raise
In us who serve new counsels to debate
What doubtful may ensue More in this place
To utter is not safe Assemble thou
Of all those myriads which we lead the chief
Tell them that by command ere yet dim night
Her shadowy cloud withdraws I am to haste
And all who under me their banners wave
Homeward with flying march where we possess
The quarters of the north there to prepare
Fit entertainment to receive our King
The great Messiah and his new commands
Who speedily through all the hierarchies
Intends to pass triumphant and give laws
So spake the false Arch-Angel and infused
Bad influence into the unwary breast
Of his associate He together calls
Or several one by one the regent Powers
Under him Regent tells as he was taught
That the Most High commanding now ere night
Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven
The great hierarchal standard was to move
Tells the suggested cause and casts between
Ambiguous words and jealousies to sound
Or taint integrity But all obeyed
The wonted signal and superiour voice
Of their great Potentate for great indeed
His name and high was his degree in Heaven
His countenance as the morning-star that guides
The starry flock allured them and with lies
Drew after him the third part of Heaven host
Mean while the Eternal eye whose sight discerns
Abstrusest thoughts from forth his holy mount
And from within the golden lamps that burn
Nightly before him saw without their light
Rebellion rising saw in whom how spread
Among the sons of morn what multitudes
Were banded to oppose his high decree
And smiling to his only Son thus said
Son thou in whom my glory I behold
In full resplendence Heir of all my might
Nearly it now concerns us to be sure
Of our Omnipotence and with what arms
We mean to hold what anciently we claim
Of deity or empire Such a foe
Is rising who intends to erect his throne
Equal to ours throughout the spacious north
Nor so content hath in his thought to try
In battle what our power is or our right
Let us advise and to this hazard draw
With speed what force is left and all employ
In our defence lest unawares we lose
This our high place our sanctuary our hill
To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear
Lightning divine ineffable serene
Made answer Mighty Father thou thy foes
Tenfold the length of this terrene At last
Far in the horizon to the north appeared
From skirt to skirt a fiery region stretched
In battailous aspect and nearer view
Bristled with upright beams innumerable
Of rigid spears and helmets thronged and shields
Various with boastful argument portrayed
The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
With furious expedition for they weened
That self-same day by fight or by surprise
To win the mount of God and on his throne
To set the Envier of his state the proud
Aspirer but their thoughts proved fond and vain
In the mid way Though strange to us it seemed
At first that Angel should with Angel war
And in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet
So oft in festivals of joy and love
Unanimous as sons of one great Sire
Hymning the Eternal Father But the shout
Of battle now began and rushing sound
Of onset ended soon each milder thought
High in the midst exalted as a God
The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat
Idol of majesty divine enclosed
With flaming Cherubim and golden shields
Then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now
'Twixt host and host but narrow space was left
A dreadful interval and front to front
Presented stood in terrible array
Of hideous length Before the cloudy van
On the rough edge of battle ere it joined
Satan with vast and haughty strides advanced
Came towering armed in adamant and gold
Abdiel that sight endured not where he stood
Among the mightiest bent on highest deeds
And thus his own undaunted heart explores
O Heaven that such resemblance of the Highest
Should yet remain where faith and realty
Remain not Wherefore should not strength and might
There fail where virtue fails or weakest prove
Where boldest though to fight unconquerable
His puissance trusting in the Almighty aid
I mean to try whose reason I have tried
Unsound and false nor is it aught but just
That he who in debate of truth hath won
Should win in arms in both disputes alike
Victor though brutish that contest and foul
When reason hath to deal with force yet so
Most reason is that reason overcome
So pondering and from his armed peers
Forth stepping opposite half-way he met
His daring foe at this prevention more
Incensed and thus securely him defied
Proud art thou met thy hope was to have reached
The highth of thy aspiring unopposed
The throne of God unguarded and his side
Abandoned at the terrour of thy power
Or potent tongue Fool not to think how vain
Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms
Who out of smallest things could without end
Have raised incessant armies to defeat
Thy folly or with solitary hand
Reaching beyond all limit at one blow
Unaided could have finished thee and whelmed
Thy legions under darkness But thou seest
All are not of thy train there be who faith
Prefer and piety to God though then
To thee not visible when I alone
Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent
From all My sect thou seest now learn too late
How few sometimes may know when thousands err
Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
Thus answered Ill for thee but in wished hour
Of my revenge first sought for thou returnest
From flight seditious Angel to receive
Thy merited reward the first assay
Of this right hand provoked since first that tongue
Inspired with contradiction durst oppose
A third part of the Gods in synod met
Their deities to assert who while they feel
Vigour divine within them can allow
Omnipotence to none But well thou comest
Before thy fellows ambitious to win
From me some plume that thy success may show
Destruction to the rest This pause between
Unanswered lest thou boast to let thee know
At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven
To heavenly souls had been all one but now
I see that most through sloth had rather serve
Ministring Spirits trained up in feast and song
Such hast thou armed the minstrelsy of Heaven
Servility with freedom to contend
As both their deeds compared this day shall prove
To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied
Apostate still thou errest nor end wilt find
Of erring from the path of truth remote
Unjustly thou depravest it with the name
Of servitude to serve whom God ordains
Or Nature God and Nature bid the same
When he who rules is worthiest and excels
Them whom he governs This is servitude
To serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled
Against his worthier as thine now serve thee
Thyself not free but to thyself enthralled
Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid
Reign thou in Hell thy kingdom let me serve
In Heaven God ever blest and his divine
Behests obey worthiest to be obeyed
Yet chains in Hell not realms expect Mean while
From me returned as erst thou saidst from flight
This greeting on thy impious crest receive
So saying a noble stroke he lifted high
Which hung not but so swift with tempest fell
On the proud crest of Satan that no sight
Nor motion of swift thought less could his shield
Such ruin intercept Ten paces huge
He back recoiled the tenth on bended knee
His massy spear upstaid as if on earth
Winds under ground or waters forcing way
Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat
Half sunk with all his pines Amazement seised
The rebel Thrones but greater rage to see
Thus foiled their mightiest ours joy filled and shout
Presage of victory and fierce desire
Of battle Whereat Michael bid sound
The Arch-Angel trumpet through the vast of Heaven
It sounded and the faithful armies rung
Hosanna to the Highest Nor stood at gaze
The adverse legions nor less hideous joined
The horrid shock Now storming fury rose
And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now
Was never arms on armour clashing brayed
Horrible discord and the madding wheels
Of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise
Of conflict over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew
And flying vaulted either host with fire
So under fiery cope together rushed
Both battles main with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage All Heaven
Resounded and had Earth been then all Earth
Had to her center shook What wonder when
Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
On either side the least of whom could wield
These elements and arm him with the force
Of all their regions How much more of power
Army against army numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion warring and disturb
Though not destroy their happy native seat
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent
From his strong hold of Heaven high over-ruled
And limited their might though numbered such
As each divided legion might have seemed
A numerous host in strength each armed hand
A legion led in fight yet leader seemed
Each warriour single as in chief expert
When to advance or stand or turn the sway
Of battle open when and when to close
The ridges of grim war No thought of flight
None of retreat no unbecoming deed
That argued fear each on himself relied
As only in his arm the moment lay
Of victory Deeds of eternal fame
Were done but infinite for wide was spread
That war and various sometimes on firm ground
A standing fight then soaring on main wing
Tormented all the air all air seemed then
Conflicting fire Long time in even scale
The battle hung till Satan who that day
Prodigious power had shown and met in arms
No equal ranging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confused at length
Saw where the sword of Michael smote and felled
Squadrons at once with huge two-handed sway
Brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
Wide-wasting such destruction to withstand
He hasted and opposed the rocky orb
Of tenfold adamant his ample shield
A vast circumference At his approach
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil
Surceased and glad as hoping here to end
Intestine war in Heaven the arch-foe subdued
Or captive dragged in chains with hostile frown
And visage all inflamed first thus began
Author of evil unknown till thy revolt
Unnamed in Heaven now plenteous as thou seest
These acts of hateful strife hateful to all
Though heaviest by just measure on thyself
And thy adherents How hast thou disturbed
Heaven blessed peace and into nature brought
Misery uncreated till the crime
Of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled
Thy malice into thousands once upright
And faithful now proved false But think not here
To trouble holy rest Heaven casts thee out
From all her confines Heaven the seat of bliss
Brooks not the works of violence and war
Hence then and evil go with thee along
Thy offspring to the place of evil Hell
Thou and thy wicked crew there mingle broils
Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom
Or some more sudden vengeance winged from God
Precipitate thee with augmented pain
So spake the Prince of Angels to whom thus
The Adversary Nor think thou with wind
Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds
Thou canst not Hast thou turned the least of these
To flight or if to fall but that they rise
Unvanquished easier to transact with me
That thou shouldst hope imperious and with threats
To chase me hence err not that so shall end
The strife which thou callest evil but we style
The strife of glory which we mean to win
Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell
Thou fablest here however to dwell free
If not to reign Mean while thy utmost force
And join him named Almighty to thy aid
I fly not but have sought thee far and nigh
They ended parle and both addressed for fight
Unspeakable for who though with the tongue
Of Angels can relate or to what things
Liken on earth conspicuous that may lift
Human imagination to such highth
Of Godlike power for likest Gods they seemed
Stood they or moved in stature motion arms
Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven
Now waved their fiery swords and in the air
Made horrid circles two broad suns their shields
Blazed opposite while Expectation stood
In horrour From each hand with speed retired
Where erst was thickest fight the angelick throng
And left large field unsafe within the wind
Of such commotion such as to set forth
Great things by small if nature concord broke
Among the constellations war were sprung
Two planets rushing from aspect malign
Of fiercest opposition in mid sky
Should combat and their jarring spheres confound
Together both with next to almighty arm
Up-lifted imminent one stroke they aimed
That might determine and not need repeat
As not of power at once nor odds appeared
In might or swift prevention But the sword
Of Michael from the armoury of God
Was given him tempered so that neither keen
Nor solid might resist that edge it met
The sword of Satan with steep force to smite
Descending and in half cut sheer nor staid
But with swift wheel reverse deep entering shared
All his right side Then Satan first knew pain
And writhed him to and fro convolved so sore
The griding sword with discontinuous wound
Passed through him But the ethereal substance closed
Not long divisible and from the gash
A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed
Sanguine such as celestial Spirits may bleed
And all his armour stained ere while so bright
Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run
By Angels many and strong who interposed
Defence while others bore him on their shields
Back to his chariot where it stood retired
From off the files of war There they him laid
Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
To find himself not matchless and his pride
Humbled by such rebuke so far beneath
His confidence to equal God in power
Yet soon he healed for Spirits that live throughout
He comes and settled in his face I see
Sad resolution and secure Let each
His adamantine coat gird well and each
Fit well his helm gripe fast his orbed shield
Borne even or high for this day will pour down
If I conjecture aught no drizzling shower
But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire
So warned he them aware themselves and soon
In order quit of all impediment
Instant without disturb they took alarm
And onward moved embattled When behold
Not distant far with heavy pace the foe
Approaching gross and huge in hollow cube
Training his devilish enginery impaled
On every side with shadowing squadrons deep
To hide the fraud At interview both stood
A while but suddenly at head appeared
Satan and thus was heard commanding loud
Vanguard to right and left the front unfold
That all may see who hate us how we seek
Peace and composure and with open breast
Stand ready to receive them if they like
Our overture and turn not back perverse
But that I doubt however witness Heaven
Heaven witness thou anon while we discharge
Freely our part ye who appointed stand
Do as you have in charge and briefly touch
What we propound and loud that all may hear
So scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce
Had ended when to right and left the front
Divided and to either flank retired
Which to our eyes discovered new and strange
A triple mounted row of pillars laid
On wheels for like to pillars most they seemed
Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir
With branches lopt in wood or mountain felled
Brass iron stony mould had not their mouths
With hideous orifice gaped on us wide
Portending hollow truce At each behind
A Seraph stood and in his hand a reed
Stood waving tipt with fire while we suspense
Collected stood within our thoughts amused
Not long for sudden all at once their reeds
Put forth and to a narrow vent applied
With nicest touch Immediate in a flame
But soon obscured with smoke all Heaven appeared
From those deep-throated engines belched whose roar
Embowelled with outrageous noise the air
And all her entrails tore disgorging foul
Their devilish glut chained thunderbolts and hail
Of iron globes which on the victor host
Levelled with such impetuous fury smote
That whom they hit none on their feet might stand
Though standing else as rocks but down they fell
By thousands Angel on Arch-Angel rolled
The sooner for their arms unarmed they might
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift
By quick contraction or remove but now
Foul dissipation followed and forced rout
Nor served it to relax their serried files
What should they do if on they rushed repulse
Repeated and indecent overthrow
Doubled would render them yet more despised
And to their foes a laughter for in view
Stood ranked of Seraphim another row
In posture to displode their second tire
Of thunder Back defeated to return
They worse abhorred Satan beheld their plight
And to his mates thus in derision called
O Friends why come not on these victors proud
Ere while they fierce were coming and when we
To entertain them fair with open front
And breast what could we more propounded terms
Of composition straight they changed their minds
Flew off and into strange vagaries fell
As they would dance yet for a dance they seemed
Somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps
For joy of offered peace But I suppose
If our proposals once again were heard
We should compel them to a quick result
To whom thus Belial in like gamesome mood
Leader the terms we sent were terms of weight
Of hard contents and full of force urged home
Such as we might perceive amused them all
And stumbled many Who receives them right
Had need from head to foot well understand
Not understood this gift they have besides
They show us when our foes walk not upright
So they among themselves in pleasant vein
Stood scoffing hightened in their thoughts beyond
All doubt of victory Eternal Might
To match with their inventions they presumed
So easy and of his thunder made a scorn
And all his host derided while they stood
A while in trouble But they stood not long
Rage prompted them at length and found them arms
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose
Forthwith behold the excellence the power
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed
Their arms away they threw and to the hills
For Earth hath this variety from Heaven
Of pleasure situate in hill and dale
Light as the lightning glimpse they ran they flew
From their foundations loosening to and fro
They plucked the seated hills with all their load
Rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops
Up-lifting bore them in their hands Amaze
Be sure and terrour seized the rebel host
When coming towards them so dread they saw
The bottom of the mountains upward turned
Till on those cursed engines' triple-row
They saw them whelmed and all their confidence
Under the weight of mountains buried deep
Themselves invaded next and on their heads
Main promontories flung which in the air
Came shadowing and oppressed whole legions armed
Their armour helped their harm crushed in and bruised
Into their substance pent which wrought them pain
Implacable and many a dolorous groan
Long struggling underneath ere they could wind
Out of such prison though Spirits of purest light
Purest at first now gross by sinning grown
The rest in imitation to like arms
Betook them and the neighbouring hills uptore
So hills amid the air encountered hills
Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire
That under ground they fought in dismal shade
Infernal noise war seemed a civil game
To this uproar horrid confusion heaped
Upon confusion rose And now all Heaven
Had gone to wrack with ruin overspread
Had not the Almighty Father where he sits
Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure
Consulting on the sum of things foreseen
This tumult and permitted all advised
That his great purpose he might so fulfil
To honour his anointed Son avenged
Upon his enemies and to declare
All power on him transferred Whence to his Son
The Assessour of his throne he thus began
Effulgence of my glory Son beloved
Son in whose face invisible is beheld
Visibly what by Deity I am
And in whose hand what by decree I do
Second Omnipotence two days are past
Two days as we compute the days of Heaven
Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
These disobedient Sore hath been their fight
As likeliest was when two such foes met armed
For to themselves I left them and thou knowest
Equal in their creation they were formed
Save what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought
Insensibly for I suspend their doom
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
Endless and no solution will be found
War wearied hath performed what war can do
And to disordered rage let loose the reins
With mountains as with weapons armed which makes
Wild work in Heaven and dangerous to the main
Two days are therefore past the third is thine
For thee I have ordained it and thus far
Have suffered that the glory may be thine
Of ending this great war since none but Thou
Can end it Into thee such virtue and grace
Immense I have transfused that all may know
In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare
And this perverse commotion governed thus
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
Of all things to be Heir and to be King
By sacred unction thy deserved right
Go then Thou Mightiest in thy Father might
Ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels
That shake Heaven basis bring forth all my war
My bow and thunder my almighty arms
Gird on and sword upon thy puissant thigh
Pursue these sons of darkness drive them out
From all Heaven bounds into the utter deep
There let them learn as likes them to despise
God and Messiah his anointed King
He said and on his Son with rays direct
Shone full he all his Father full expressed
Ineffably into his face received
And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake
O Father O Supreme of heavenly Thrones
First Highest Holiest Best thou always seek'st
To glorify thy Son I always thee
As is most just This I my glory account
My exaltation and my whole delight
That thou in me well pleased declarest thy will
Fulfilled which to fulfil is all my bliss
Scepter and power thy giving I assume
And gladlier shall resign when in the end
Thou shalt be all in all and I in thee
For ever and in me all whom thou lovest
But whom thou hatest I hate and can put on
Thy terrours as I put thy mildness on
Image of thee in all things and shall soon
Armed with thy might rid Heaven of these rebelled
To their prepared ill mansion driven down
To chains of darkness and the undying worm
That from thy just obedience could revolt
Whom to obey is happiness entire
Then shall thy Saints unmixed and from the impure
Far separate circling thy holy mount
Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing
Hymns of high praise and I among them Chief
So said he o'er his scepter bowing rose
From the right hand of Glory where he sat
And the third sacred morn began to shine
Dawning through Heaven Forth rushed with whirlwind sound
The chariot of Paternal Deity
Flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn
Itself instinct with Spirit but convoyed
By four Cherubick shapes four faces each
Had wonderous as with stars their bodies all
And wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels
Of beryl and careering fires between
Led on yet sinless with desire to know
What nearer might concern him how this world
Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began
When and whereof created for what cause
What within Eden or without was done
Before his memory as one whose drouth
Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites
Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest
Great things and full of wonder in our ears
Far differing from this world thou hast revealed
Divine interpreter by favour sent
Down from the empyrean to forewarn
Us timely of what might else have been our loss
Unknown which human knowledge could not reach
For which to the infinitely Good we owe
Immortal thanks and his admonishment
Receive with solemn purpose to observe
Immutably his sovran will the end
Of what we are But since thou hast vouchsafed
Gently for our instruction to impart
Things above earthly thought which yet concerned
Our knowing as to highest wisdom seemed
Deign to descend now lower and relate
What may no less perhaps avail us known
How first began this Heaven which we behold
Distant so high with moving fires adorned
Innumerable and this which yields or fills
All space the ambient air wide interfused
Embracing round this floried Earth what cause
Moved the Creator in his holy rest
Through all eternity so late to build
In Chaos and the work begun how soon
Absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold
What we not to explore the secrets ask
Of his eternal empire but the more
To magnify his works the more we know
And the great light of day yet wants to run
Much of his race though steep suspense in Heaven
Held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears
And longer will delay to hear thee tell
His generation and the rising birth
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep
Or if the star of evening and the moon
Haste to thy audience Night with her will bring
Silence and Sleep listening to thee will watch
Or we can bid his absence till thy song
End and dismiss thee ere the morning shine
Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought
And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild
This also thy request with caution asked
Obtain though to recount almighty works
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend
Yet what thou canst attain which best may serve
To glorify the Maker and infer
Thee also happier shall not be withheld
Thy hearing such commission from above
I have received to answer thy desire
Of knowledge within bounds beyond abstain
To ask nor let thine own inventions hope
Things not revealed which the invisible King
Only Omniscient hath suppressed in night
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven
Enough is left besides to search and know
But knowledge is as food and needs no less
Her temperance over appetite to know
In measure what the mind may well contain
Oppresses else with surfeit and soon turns
Wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind
Know then that after Lucifer from Heaven
So call him brighter once amidst the host
Of Angels than that star the stars among
Fell with his flaming legions through the deep
Into his place and the great Son returned
Victorious with his Saints the Omnipotent
Eternal Father from his throne beheld
Their multitude and to his Son thus spake
At least our envious Foe hath failed who thought
All like himself rebellious by whose aid
This inaccessible high strength the seat
Of Deity supreme us dispossessed
He trusted to have seised and into fraud
Drew many whom their place knows here no more
Yet far the greater part have kept I see
Their station Heaven yet populous retains
Number sufficient to possess her realms
Though wide and this high temple to frequent
With ministeries due and solemn rites
But lest his heart exalt him in the harm
Already done to have dispeopled Heaven
My damage fondly deemed I can repair
That detriment if such it be to lose
Self-lost and in a moment will create
Another world out of one man a race
Of men innumerable there to dwell
Not here till by degrees of merit raised
They open to themselves at length the way
Up hither under long obedience tried
And Earth be changed to Heaven and Heaven to Earth
One kingdom joy and union without end
Mean while inhabit lax ye Powers of Heaven
And thou my Word begotten Son by thee
This I perform speak thou and be it done
My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee
I send along ride forth and bid the Deep
Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth
Boundless the Deep because I Am who fill
Infinitude nor vacuous the space
Though I uncircumscribed myself retire
And put not forth my goodness which is free
To act or not Necessity and Chance
Approach not me and what I will is Fate
So spake the Almighty and to what he spake
His Word the Filial Godhead gave effect
Immediate are the acts of God more swift
Than time or motion but to human ears
Cannot without process of speech be told
So told as earthly notion can receive
Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven
When such was heard declared the Almighty will
Glory they sung to the Most High good will
To future men and in their dwellings peace
Glory to Him whose just avenging ire
Had driven out the ungodly from his sight
And the habitations of the just to Him
Glory and praise whose wisdom had ordained
Good out of evil to create instead
Of Spirits malign a better race to bring
Into their vacant room and thence diffuse
His good to worlds and ages infinite
So sang the Hierarchies Mean while the Son
On his great expedition now appeared
Girt with Omnipotence with radiance crowned
Of Majesty Divine sapience and love
Immense and all his Father in him shone
About his chariot numberless were poured
Cherub and Seraph Potentates and Thrones
And Virtues winged Spirits and chariots winged
From the armoury of God where stand of old
Myriads between two brazen mountains lodged
Against a solemn day harnessed at hand
Celestial equipage and now came forth
Spontaneous for within them Spirit lived
Attendant on their Lord Heaven opened wide
Her ever-during gates harmonious sound
On golden hinges moving to let forth
The King of Glory in his powerful Word
And Spirit coming to create new worlds
On heavenly ground they stood and from the shore
They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss
Outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild
Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
And surging waves as mountains to assault
Heaven highth and with the center mix the pole
Silence ye troubled Waves and thou Deep peace
Said then the Omnifick Word your discord end
Nor staid but on the wings of Cherubim
Uplifted in paternal glory rode
Far into Chaos and the world unborn
For Chaos heard his voice Him all his train
Followed in bright procession to behold
Creation and the wonders of his might
Then staid the fervid wheels and in his hand
He took the golden compasses prepared
In God eternal store to circumscribe
This universe and all created things
One foot he centered and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure
And said Thus far extend thus far thy bounds
This be thy just circumference O World
Thus God the Heaven created thus the Earth
Matter unformed and void Darkness profound
Covered the abyss but on the watery calm
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread
And vital virtue infused and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid mass but downward purged
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs
Adverse to life then founded then conglobed
Like things to like the rest to several place
Disparted and between spun out the air
And Earth self-balanced on her center hung
Let there be light said God and forthwith Light
Ethereal first of things quintessence pure
Sprung from the deep and from her native east
To journey through the aery gloom began
Sphered in a radiant cloud for yet the sun
Was not she in a cloudy tabernacle
Sojourned the while God saw the light was good
And light from darkness by the hemisphere
Divided light the Day and darkness Night
He named Thus was the first day even and morn
Nor past uncelebrated nor unsung
By the celestial quires when orient light
Exhaling first from darkness they beheld
Birth-day of Heaven and Earth with joy and shout
The hollow universal orb they filled
And touched their golden harps and hymning praised
God and his works Creator him they sung
Both when first evening was and when first morn
Again God said Let there be firmament
Amid the waters and let it divide
The waters from the waters and God made
The firmament expanse of liquid pure
Transparent elemental air diffused
In circuit to the uttermost convex
Of this great round partition firm and sure
The waters underneath from those above
Dividing for as earth so he the world
Built on circumfluous waters calm in wide
Crystalline ocean and the loud misrule
Of Chaos far removed lest fierce extremes
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame
And Heaven he named the Firmament So even
And morning chorus sung the second day
The Earth was formed but in the womb as yet
Of waters embryon immature involved
Appeared not over all the face of Earth
Main ocean flowed not idle but with warm
Prolifick humour softening all her globe
Fermented the great mother to conceive
Satiate with genial moisture when God said
Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven
Into one place and let dry land appear
Immediately the mountains huge appear
Emergent and their broad bare backs upheave
Into the clouds their tops ascend the sky
So high as heaved the tumid hills so low
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep
Capacious bed of waters Thither they
Hasted with glad precipitance uprolled
As drops on dust conglobing from the dry
Part rise in crystal wall or ridge direct
For haste such flight the great command impressed
On the swift floods As armies at the call
Of trumpet for of armies thou hast heard
Troop to their standard so the watery throng
Wave rolling after wave where way they found
If steep with torrent rapture if through plain
Soft-ebbing nor withstood them rock or hill
But they or under ground or circuit wide
With serpent errour wandering found their way
And on the washy oose deep channels wore
Easy ere God had bid the ground be dry
All but within those banks where rivers now
Stream and perpetual draw their humid train
The dry land Earth and the great receptacle
Of congregated waters he called Seas
And saw that it was good and said Let the Earth
Put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed
And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind
Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth
He scarce had said when the bare Earth till then
Desart and bare unsightly unadorned
Brought forth the tender grass whose verdure clad
Her universal face with pleasant green
Then herbs of every leaf that sudden flowered
Opening their various colours and made gay
Her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown
Forth flourished thick the clustering vine forth crept
The swelling gourd up stood the corny reed
Gave thee all sorts are here that all the Earth yields
Variety without end but of the tree
Which tasted works knowledge of good and evil
Thou mayest not in the day thou eatest thou diest
Death is the penalty imposed beware
And govern well thy appetite lest Sin
Surprise thee and her black attendant Death
Here finished he and all that he had made
Viewed and behold all was entirely good
So even and morn accomplished the sixth day
Yet not till the Creator from his work
Desisting though unwearied up returned
Up to the Heaven of Heavens his high abode
Thence to behold this new created world
The addition of his empire how it showed
In prospect from his throne how good how fair
Answering his great idea Up he rode
Followed with acclamation and the sound
Symphonious of ten thousand harps that tuned
Angelick harmonies The earth the air
Resounded thou rememberest for thou heardst
The heavens and all the constellations rung
The planets in their station listening stood
While the bright pomp ascended jubilant
Open ye everlasting gates they sung
Open ye Heavens your living doors let in
The great Creator from his work returned
Magnificent his six days work a World
Open and henceforth oft for God will deign
To visit oft the dwellings of just men
Delighted and with frequent intercourse
Thither will send his winged messengers
On errands of supernal grace So sung
The glorious train ascending He through Heaven
That opened wide her blazing portals led
To God eternal house direct the way
A broad and ample road whose dust is gold
And pavement stars as stars to thee appear
Seen in the galaxy that milky way
Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
Powdered with stars And now on Earth the seventh
Evening arose in Eden for the sun
Was set and twilight from the east came on
Forerunning night when at the holy mount
Of Heaven high-seated top the imperial throne
Of Godhead fixed for ever firm and sure
The Filial Power arrived and sat him down
With his great Father for he also went
Invisible yet staid such privilege
Hath Omnipresence and the work ordained
Author and End of all things and from work
Now resting blessed and hallowed the seventh day
As resting on that day from all his work
But not in silence holy kept the harp
Had work and rested not the solemn pipe
And dulcimer all organs of sweet stop
All sounds on fret by string or golden wire
Tempered soft tunings intermixed with voice
Choral or unison of incense clouds
Fuming from golden censers hid the mount
Creation and the six days acts they sung
Great are thy works Jehovah infinite
Thy power what thought can measure thee or tongue
Relate thee Greater now in thy return
Than from the giant Angels Thee that day
Thy thunders magnified but to create
Is greater than created to destroy
Who can impair thee Mighty King or bound
Thy empire Easily the proud attempt
Of Spirits apostate and their counsels vain
Thou hast repelled while impiously they thought
Thee to diminish and from thee withdraw
The number of thy worshippers Who seeks
To lessen thee against his purpose serves
To manifest the more thy might his evil
Thou usest and from thence createst more good
Witness this new-made world another Heaven
From Heaven-gate not far founded in view
On the clear hyaline the glassy sea
Of amplitude almost immense with stars
Numerous and every star perhaps a world
Of destined habitation but thou knowest
Their seasons among these the seat of Men
Earth with her nether ocean circumfused
Their pleasant dwelling-place Thrice happy Men
And sons of Men whom God hath thus advanced
Created in his image there to dwell
And worship him and in reward to rule
Over his works on earth in sea or air
And multiply a race of worshippers
Holy and just Thrice happy if they know
Their happiness and persevere upright
So sung they and the empyrean rung
With halleluiahs Thus was sabbath kept
And thy request think now fulfilled that asked
How first this world and face of things began
And what before thy memory was done
From the beginning that posterity
Informed by thee might know If else thou seekest
Aught not surpassing human measure say
Book VIII
The Angel ended and in Adam ear
So charming left his voice that he a while
Thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear
Then as new waked thus gratefully replied
What thanks sufficient or what recompence
Equal have I to render thee divine
Historian who thus largely hast allayed
The thirst I had of knowledge and vouchsafed
This friendly condescension to relate
Things else by me unsearchable now heard
With wonder but delight and as is due
With glory attributed to the high
Creator Something yet of doubt remains
Which only thy solution can resolve
When I behold this goodly frame this world
Of Heaven and Earth consisting and compute
Their magnitudes this Earth a spot a grain
An atom with the firmament compared
And all her numbered stars that seem to roll
Spaces incomprehensible for such
Their distance argues and their swift return
Diurnal merely to officiate light
Round this opacous Earth this punctual spot
One day and night in all her vast survey
Useless besides reasoning I oft admire
How Nature wise and frugal could commit
Such disproportions with superfluous hand
So many nobler bodies to create
Greater so manifold to this one use
For aught appears and on their orbs impose
Such restless revolution day by day
Repeated while the sedentary Earth
That better might with far less compass move
Served by more noble than herself attains
Her end without least motion and receives
As tribute such a sumless journey brought
Of incorporeal speed her warmth and light
Speed to describe whose swiftness number fails
So spake our sire and by his countenance seemed
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse which Eve
Perceiving where she sat retired in sight
With lowliness majestick from her seat
And grace that won who saw to wish her stay
Rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers
To visit how they prospered bud and bloom
Her nursery they at her coming sprung
And touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew
Yet went she not as not with such discourse
Delighted or not capable her ear
Of what was high such pleasure she reserved
Adam relating she sole auditress
Her husband the relater she preferred
Before the Angel and of him to ask
Chose rather he she knew would intermix
Grateful digressions and solve high dispute
With conjugal caresses from his lip
Not words alone pleased her O when meet now
Such pairs in love and mutual honour joined
With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went
Not unattended for on her as Queen
A pomp of winning Graces waited still
And from about her shot darts of desire
Into all eyes to wish her still in sight
And Raphael now to Adam doubt proposed
Benevolent and facile thus replied
To ask or search I blame thee not for Heaven
Is as the book of God before thee set
Wherein to read his wonderous works and learn
His seasons hours or days or months or years
This to attain whether Heaven move or Earth
Imports not if thou reckon right the rest
From Man or Angel the great Architect
Did wisely to conceal and not divulge
His secrets to be scanned by them who ought
Rather admire or if they list to try
Conjecture he his fabrick of the Heavens
Hath left to their disputes perhaps to move
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide
Hereafter when they come to model Heaven
And calculate the stars how they will wield
The mighty frame how build unbuild contrive
To save appearances how gird the sphere
With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er
Cycle and epicycle orb in orb
Already by thy reasoning this I guess
Who art to lead thy offspring and supposest
That bodies bright and greater should not serve
The less not bright nor Heaven such journeys run
Earth sitting still when she alone receives
The benefit Consider first that great
Or bright infers not excellence the Earth
Though in comparison of Heaven so small
Nor glistering may of solid good contain
More plenty than the sun that barren shines
Whose virtue on itself works no effect
But in the fruitful Earth there first received
His beams unactive else their vigour find
Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries
Officious but to thee Earth habitant
And for the Heaven wide circuit let it speak
The Maker high magnificence who built
So spacious and his line stretched out so far
That Man may know he dwells not in his own
An edifice too large for him to fill
Lodged in a small partition and the rest
Ordained for uses to his Lord best known
The swiftness of those circles attribute
Though numberless to his Omnipotence
That to corporeal substances could add
Speed almost spiritual Me thou thinkest not slow
Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven
Where God resides and ere mid-day arrived
In Eden distance inexpressible
By numbers that have name But this I urge
Admitting motion in the Heavens to show
Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved
Not that I so affirm though so it seem
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth
God to remove his ways from human sense
Placed Heaven from Earth so far that earthly sight
If it presume might err in things too high
And no advantage gain What if the sun
Be center to the world and other stars
By his attractive virtue and their own
Incited dance about him various rounds
Their wandering course now high now low then hid
Progressive retrograde or standing still
In six thou seest and what if seventh to these
The planet earth so stedfast though she seem
Insensibly three different motions move
Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe
Moved contrary with thwart obliquities
Or save the sun his labour and that swift
Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed
Invisible else above all stars the wheel
Of day and night which needs not thy belief
If earth industrious of herself fetch day
Travelling east and with her part averse
From the sun beam meet night her other part
Still luminous by his ray What if that light
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air
To the terrestrial moon be as a star
Enlightening her by day as she by night
This earth reciprocal if land be there
Fields and inhabitants Her spots thou seest
As clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce
Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
Allotted there and other suns perhaps
With their attendant moons thou wilt descry
Communicating male and female light
Which two great sexes animate the world
Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
By living soul desart and desolate
Only to shine yet scarce to contribute
Each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far
Down to this habitable which returns
Light back to them is obvious to dispute
But whether thus these things or whether not
But whether the sun predominant in Heaven
Rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun
He from the east his flaming road begin
Or she from west her silent course advance
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
On her soft axle while she paces even
And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid
Leave them to God above him serve and fear
Of other creatures as him pleases best
Wherever placed let him dispose joy thou
In what he gives to thee this Paradise
And thy fair Eve Heaven is for thee too high
To know what passes there be lowly wise
Think only what concerns thee and thy being
Dream not of other worlds what creatures there
Live in what state condition or degree
Contented that thus far hath been revealed
Not of Earth only but of highest Heaven
To whom thus Adam cleared of doubt replied
How fully hast thou satisfied me pure
Intelligence of Heaven Angel serene
And freed from intricacies taught to live
The easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts
To interrupt the sweet of life from which
God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares
And not molest us unless we ourselves
Seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain
But apt the mind or fancy is to rove
Unchecked and of her roving is no end
Till warned or by experience taught she learn
That not to know at large of things remote
From use obscure and subtle but to know
That which before us lies in daily life
Is the prime wisdom What is more is fume
Or emptiness or fond impertinence
And renders us in things that most concern
Unpractised unprepared and still to seek
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
A lower flight and speak of things at hand
Useful whence haply mention may arise
Of something not unseasonable to ask
By sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned
Thee I have heard relating what was done
Ere my remembrance now hear me relate
My story which perhaps thou hast not heard
And day is not yet spent till then thou seest
How subtly to detain thee I devise
Inviting thee to hear while I relate
Fond were it not in hope of thy reply
For while I sit with thee I seem in Heaven
So saying by the hand he took me raised
And over fields and waters as in air
Smooth-sliding without step last led me up
A woody mountain whose high top was plain
A circuit wide enclosed with goodliest trees
Planted with walks and bowers that what I saw
Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed Each tree
Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye
Tempting stirred in me sudden appetite
To pluck and eat whereat I waked and found
Before mine eyes all real as the dream
Had lively shadowed Here had new begun
My wandering had not he who was my guide
Up hither from among the trees appeared
Presence Divine Rejoicing but with awe
In adoration at his feet I fell
Submiss He reared me and Whom thou soughtest I am
Said mildly Author of all this thou seest
Above or round about thee or beneath
This Paradise I give thee count it thine
To till and keep and of the fruit to eat
Of every tree that in the garden grows
Eat freely with glad heart fear here no dearth
But of the tree whose operation brings
Knowledge of good and ill which I have set
The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith
Amid the garden by the tree of life
Remember what I warn thee shun to taste
And shun the bitter consequence for know
The day thou eatest thereof my sole command
Transgressed inevitably thou shalt die
From that day mortal and this happy state
Shalt lose expelled from hence into a world
Of woe and sorrow Sternly he pronounced
The rigid interdiction which resounds
Yet dreadful in mine ear though in my choice
Not to incur but soon his clear aspect
Returned and gracious purpose thus renewed
Not only these fair bounds but all the Earth
To thee and to thy race I give as lords
Possess it and all things that therein live
Or live in sea or air beast fish and fowl
In sign whereof each bird and beast behold
After their kinds I bring them to receive
From thee their names and pay thee fealty
With low subjection understand the same
Of fish within their watery residence
Not hither summoned since they cannot change
Their element to draw the thinner air
As thus he spake each bird and beast behold
Approaching two and two these cowering low
With blandishment each bird stooped on his wing
I named them as they passed and understood
Their nature with such knowledge God endued
My sudden apprehension But in these
I found not what methought I wanted still
And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed
O by what name for thou above all these
Above mankind or aught than mankind higher
Surpassest far my naming how may I
Adore thee Author of this universe
And all this good to man for whose well being
So amply and with hands so liberal
Thou hast provided all things But with me
I see not who partakes In solitude
What happiness who can enjoy alone
Or all enjoying what contentment find
Thus I presumptuous and the Vision bright
As with a smile more brightened thus replied
What callest thou solitude Is not the Earth
With various living creatures and the air
Replenished and all these at thy command
To come and play before thee Knowest thou not
Their language and their ways They also know
And reason not contemptibly With these
Find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large
So spake the Universal Lord and seemed
So ordering I with leave of speech implored
And humble deprecation thus replied
Let not my words offend thee Heavenly Power
My Maker be propitious while I speak
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute
And these inferiour far beneath me set
Among unequals what society
Can sort what harmony or true delight
Which must be mutual in proportion due
Given and received but in disparity
The one intense the other still remiss
Cannot well suit with either but soon prove
Tedious alike Of fellowship I speak
Such as I seek fit to participate
All rational delight wherein the brute
Cannot be human consort They rejoice
Each with their kind lion with lioness
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined
Much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl
So well converse nor with the ox the ape
Worse then can man with beast and least of all
Whereto the Almighty answered not displeased
A nice and subtle happiness I see
Thou to thyself proposest in the choice
Of thy associates Adam and wilt taste
No pleasure though in pleasure solitary
What thinkest thou then of me and this my state
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed
Of happiness or not who am alone
From all eternity for none I know
Than self-esteem grounded on just and right
Well managed of that skill the more thou knowest
The more she will acknowledge thee her head
And to realities yield all her shows
Made so adorn for thy delight the more
So awful that with honour thou mayest love
Thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
Is propagated seem such dear delight
Beyond all other think the same vouchsafed
To cattle and each beast which would not be
To them made common and divulged if aught
Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
The soul of man or passion in him move
What higher in her society thou findest
Attractive human rational love still
In loving thou dost well in passion not
Wherein true love consists not Love refines
The thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat
In reason and is judicious is the scale
By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend
Not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause
Among the beasts no mate for thee was found
To whom thus half abashed Adam replied
Neither her outside formed so fair nor aught
In procreation common to all kinds
Though higher of the genial bed by far
And with mysterious reverence I deem
So much delights me as those graceful acts
Those thousand decencies that daily flow
From all her words and actions mixed with love
And sweet compliance which declare unfeigned
Union of mind or in us both one soul
Harmony to behold in wedded pair
More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear
Yet these subject not I to thee disclose
What inward thence I feel not therefore foiled
Who meet with various objects from the sense
Variously representing yet still free
Approve the best and follow what I approve
To love thou blamest me not for Love thou sayest
Leads up to Heaven is both the way and guide
Bear with me then if lawful what I ask
Love not the heavenly Spirits and how their love
Express they by looks only or do they mix
Irradiance virtual or immediate touch
To whom the Angel with a smile that glowed
Celestial rosy red Love proper hue
Answered Let it suffice thee that thou knowest
Us happy and without love no happiness
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest
And pure thou wert created we enjoy
In eminence and obstacle find none
Of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars
Easier than air with air if Spirits embrace
Total they mix union of pure with pure
Desiring nor restrained conveyance need
As flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul
But I can now no more the parting sun
Beyond the Earth green Cape and verdant Isles
Hesperian sets my signal to depart
Be strong live happy and love But first of all
Him whom to love is to obey and keep
His great command take heed lest passion sway
Thy judgement to do aught which else free will
Would not admit thine and of all thy sons
The weal or woe in thee is placed beware
I in thy persevering shall rejoice
And all the Blest Stand fast to stand or fall
Free in thine own arbitrement it lies
Perfect within no outward aid require
And all temptation to transgress repel
So saying he arose whom Adam thus
Followed with benediction Since to part
Go heavenly guest ethereal Messenger
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore
Gentle to me and affable hath been
Thy condescension and shall be honoured ever
With grateful memory Thou to mankind
Be good and friendly still and oft return
So parted they the Angel up to Heaven
From the thick shade and Adam to his bower
Book IX
No more of talk where God or Angel guest
With Man as with his friend familiar us'd
To sit indulgent and with him partake
Rural repast permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblam'd I now must change
Those notes to tragick foul distrust and breach
Disloyal on the part of Man revolt
And disobedience on the part of Heaven
Now alienated distance and distaste
Anger and just rebuke and judgement given
That brought into this world a world of woe
Sin and her shadow Death and Misery
Death harbinger Sad task yet argument
Not less but more heroick than the wrath
Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued
Thrice fugitive about Troy wall or rage
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd
Or Neptune ire or Juno that so long
Perplexed the Greek and Cytherea son
If answerable style I can obtain
Of my celestial patroness who deigns
Her nightly visitation unimplor'd
And dictates to me slumbering or inspires
Easy my unpremeditated verse
Since first this subject for heroick song
Pleas'd me long choosing and beginning late
Not sedulous by nature to indite
Wars hitherto the only argument
Heroick deem'd chief mastery to dissect
With long and tedious havock fabled knights
In battles feign'd the better fortitude
Of patience and heroick martyrdom
Unsung or to describe races and games
Or tilting furniture imblazon'd shields
Impresses quaint caparisons and steeds
Bases and tinsel trappings gorgeous knights
At joust and tournament then marshall'd feast
Serv'd up in hall with sewers and seneshals
The skill of artifice or office mean
Not that which justly gives heroick name
To person or to poem Me of these
Nor skill'd nor studious higher argument
Remains sufficient of itself to raise
That name unless an age too late or cold
Climate or years damp my intended wing
Depress'd and much they may if all be mine
Not hers who brings it nightly to my ear
The sun was sunk and after him the star
Of Hesperus whose office is to bring
Twilight upon the earth short arbiter
'Twixt day and night and now from end to end
Night hemisphere had veil'd the horizon round
When satan who late fled before the threats
Of Gabriel out of Eden now improv'd
In meditated fraud and malice bent
On Man destruction maugre what might hap
In Eden on the humid flowers that breathed
Their morning incense when all things that breathe
From the Earth great altar send up silent praise
To the Creator and his nostrils fill
With grateful smell forth came the human pair
And joined their vocal worship to the quire
Of creatures wanting voice that done partake
The season prime for sweetest scents and airs
Then commune how that day they best may ply
Their growing work for much their work out-grew
The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide
And Eve first to her husband thus began
Adam well may we labour still to dress
This garden still to tend plant herb and flower
Our pleasant task enjoined but till more hands
Aid us the work under our labour grows
Luxurious by restraint what we by day
Lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind
One night or two with wanton growth derides
Tending to wild Thou therefore now advise
Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present
Let us divide our labours thou where choice
Leads thee or where most needs whether to wind
The woodbine round this arbour or direct
The clasping ivy where to climb while I
In yonder spring of roses intermixed
With myrtle find what to redress till noon
For while so near each other thus all day
Our task we choose what wonder if so near
Looks intervene and smiles or object new
Casual discourse draw on which intermits
Our day work brought to little though begun
Early and the hour of supper comes unearned
To whom mild answer Adam thus returned
Sole Eve associate sole to me beyond
Compare above all living creatures dear
Well hast thou motioned well thy thoughts employed
How we might best fulfil the work which here
God hath assigned us nor of me shalt pass
Unpraised for nothing lovelier can be found
In woman than to study houshold good
And good works in her husband to promote
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed
Labour as to debar us when we need
Refreshment whether food or talk between
Food of the mind or this sweet intercourse
Of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow
To brute denied and are of love the food
Love not the lowest end of human life
For not to irksome toil but to delight
He made us and delight to reason joined
These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands
Will keep from wilderness with ease as wide
As we need walk till younger hands ere long
Assist us But if much converse perhaps
Thee satiate to short absence I could yield
For solitude sometimes is best society
And short retirement urges sweet return
But other doubt possesses me lest harm
Befall thee severed from me for thou knowest
What hath been warned us what malicious foe
Envying our happiness and of his own
Despairing seeks to work us woe and shame
By sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand
Watches no doubt with greedy hope to find
His wish and best advantage us asunder
Hopeless to circumvent us joined where each
To other speedy aid might lend at need
Whether his first design be to withdraw
Our fealty from God or to disturb
Conjugal love than which perhaps no bliss
Enjoyed by us excites his envy more
Or this or worse leave not the faithful side
That gave thee being still shades thee and protects
The wife where danger or dishonour lurks
Safest and seemliest by her husband stays
Who guards her or with her the worst endures
To whom the virgin majesty of Eve
As one who loves and some unkindness meets
With sweet austere composure thus replied
Offspring of Heaven and Earth and all Earth Lord
That such an enemy we have who seeks
Our ruin both by thee informed I learn
And from the parting Angel over-heard
As in a shady nook I stood behind
Just then returned at shut of evening flowers
But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
To God or thee because we have a foe
May tempt it I expected not to hear
His violence thou fearest not being such
As we not capable of death or pain
Can either not receive or can repel
His fraud is then thy fear which plain infers
Thy equal fear that my firm faith and love
Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced
Thoughts which how found they harbour in thy breast
Adam mis-thought of her to thee so dear
To whom with healing words Adam replied
Daughter of God and Man immortal Eve
For such thou art from sin and blame entire
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
Thy absence from my sight but to avoid
The attempt itself intended by our foe
For he who tempts though in vain at least asperses
The tempted with dishonour foul supposed
Not incorruptible of faith not proof
Against temptation Thou thyself with scorn
And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong
Though ineffectual found misdeem not then
If such affront I labour to avert
From thee alone which on us both at once
The enemy though bold will hardly dare
Or daring first on me the assault shall light
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn
Subtle he needs must be who could seduce
Angels nor think superfluous other aid
I from the influence of thy looks receive
Access in every virtue in thy sight
More wise more watchful stronger if need were
Of outward strength while shame thou looking on
Shame to be overcome or over-reached
Would utmost vigour raise and raised unite
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
When I am present and thy trial choose
With me best witness of thy virtue tried
So spake domestick Adam in his care
And matrimonial love but Eve who thought
Less attributed to her faith sincere
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed
If this be our condition thus to dwell
In narrow circuit straitened by a foe
Subtle or violent we not endued
Single with like defence wherever met
How are we happy still in fear of harm
But harm precedes not sin only our foe
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
Of our integrity his foul esteem
Sticks no dishonour on our front but turns
Foul on himself then wherefore shunned or feared
By us who rather double honour gain
From his surmise proved false find peace within
Favour from Heaven our witness from the event
And what is faith love virtue unassayed
Alone without exteriour help sustained
Let us not then suspect our happy state
Left so imperfect by the Maker wise
As not secure to single or combined
Frail is our happiness if this be so
And Eden were no Eden thus exposed
To whom thus Adam fervently replied
O Woman best are all things as the will
Of God ordained them His creating hand
Nothing imperfect or deficient left
Of all that he created much less Man
Or aught that might his happy state secure
Secure from outward force within himself
The danger lies yet lies within his power
Against his will he can receive no harm
But God left free the will for what obeys
Reason is free and Reason he made right
But bid her well be ware and still erect
Lest by some fair-appearing good surprised
She dictate false and mis-inform the will
To do what God expressly hath forbid
Not then mistrust but tender love enjoins
That I should mind thee oft and mind thou me
Firm we subsist yet possible to swerve
Since Reason not impossibly may meet
Some specious object by the foe suborned
And fall into deception unaware
Not keeping strictest watch as she was warned
Seek not temptation then which to avoid
Were better and most likely if from me
Thou sever not Trial will come unsought
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy approve
First thy obedience the other who can know
Not seeing thee attempted who attest
But if thou think trial unsought may find
Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest
Go for thy stay not free absents thee more
To lure her eye she busied heard the sound
Of rusling leaves but minded not as used
To such disport before her through the field
From every beast more duteous at her call
Than at Circean call the herd disguised
He bolder now uncalled before her stood
But as in gaze admiring oft he bowed
His turret crest and sleek enamelled neck
Fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod
His gentle dumb expression turned at length
The eye of Eve to mark his play he glad
Of her attention gained with serpent-tongue
Organick or impulse of vocal air
His fraudulent temptation thus began
Wonder not sovran Mistress if perhaps
Thou canst who art sole wonder much less arm
Thy looks the Heaven of mildness with disdain
Displeased that I approach thee thus and gaze
Insatiate I thus single nor have feared
Thy awful brow more awful thus retired
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair
Thee all things living gaze on all things thine
By gift and thy celestial beauty adore
With ravishment beheld there best beheld
Where universally admired but here
In this enclosure wild these beasts among
Beholders rude and shallow to discern
Half what in thee is fair one man except
Who sees thee and what is one who should be seen
A Goddess among Gods adored and served
By Angels numberless thy daily train
So glozed the Tempter and his proem tuned
Into the heart of Eve his words made way
Though at the voice much marvelling at length
Not unamazed she thus in answer spake
What may this mean language of man pronounced
By tongue of brute and human sense expressed
The first at least of these I thought denied
To beasts whom God on their creation-day
Created mute to all articulate sound
The latter I demur for in their looks
Much reason and in their actions oft appears
Thee Serpent subtlest beast of all the field
I knew but not with human voice endued
Redouble then this miracle and say
How camest thou speakable of mute and how
To me so friendly grown above the rest
Of brutal kind that daily are in sight
Say for such wonder claims attention due
To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied
Empress of this fair world resplendent Eve
Easy to me it is to tell thee all
What thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed
I was at first as other beasts that graze
The trodden herb of abject thoughts and low
As was my food nor aught but food discerned
Or sex and apprehended nothing high
Till on a day roving the field I chanced
A goodly tree far distant to behold
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed
Ruddy and gold I nearer drew to gaze
When from the boughs a savoury odour blown
Grateful to appetite more pleased my sense
Than smell of sweetest fennel or the teats
Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even
Unsucked of lamb or kid that tend their play
To satisfy the sharp desire I had
Of tasting those fair apples I resolved
Not to defer hunger and thirst at once
Powerful persuaders quickened at the scent
Of that alluring fruit urged me so keen
About the mossy trunk I wound me soon
For high from ground the branches would require
Thy utmost reach or Adam Round the tree
All other beasts that saw with like desire
Longing and envying stood but could not reach
Amid the tree now got where plenty hung
Tempting so nigh to pluck and eat my fill
I spared not for such pleasure till that hour
At feed or fountain never had I found
Sated at length ere long I might perceive
Strange alteration in me to degree
Of reason in my inward powers and speech
Wanted not long though to this shape retained
Thenceforth to speculations high or deep
I turned my thoughts and with capacious mind
Considered all things visible in Heaven
Or Earth or Middle all things fair and good
But all that fair and good in thy divine
Semblance and in thy beauty heavenly ray
United I beheld no fair to thine
Equivalent or second which compelled
Me thus though importune perhaps to come
And gaze and worship thee of right declared
Sovran of creatures universal Dame
So talked the spirited sly Snake and Eve
Yet more amazed unwary thus replied
Serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt
The virtue of that fruit in thee first proved
But say where grows the tree from hence how far
For many are the trees of God that grow
In Paradise and various yet unknown
To us in such abundance lies our choice
As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched
Still hanging incorruptible till men
Grow up to their provision and more hands
Help to disburden Nature of her birth
To whom the wily Adder blithe and glad
Empress the way is ready and not long
Beyond a row of myrtles on a flat
Fast by a fountain one small thicket past
Of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept
My conduct I can bring thee thither soon
Lead then said Eve He leading swiftly rolled
In tangles and made intricate seem straight
To mischief swift Hope elevates and joy
Brightens his crest as when a wandering fire
Compact of unctuous vapour which the night
Condenses and the cold environs round
Kindled through agitation to a flame
Which oft they say some evil Spirit attends
Hovering and blazing with delusive light
Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way
To bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool
There swallowed up and lost from succour far
So glistered the dire Snake and into fraud
Led Eve our credulous mother to the tree
Of prohibition root of all our woe
Which when she saw thus to her guide she spake
Serpent we might have spared our coming hither
Fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess
The credit of whose virtue rest with thee
Wonderous indeed if cause of such effects
But of this tree we may not taste nor touch
God so commanded and left that command
Sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
Law to ourselves our reason is our law
To whom the Tempter guilefully replied
Indeed hath God then said that of the fruit
Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat
Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air
To whom thus Eve yet sinless Of the fruit
Of each tree in the garden we may eat
But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
The garden God hath said Ye shall not eat
Thereof nor shall ye touch it lest ye die
She scarce had said though brief when now more bold
The Tempter but with show of zeal and love
To Man and indignation at his wrong
New part puts on and as to passion moved
Fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act
Raised as of some great matter to begin
As when of old some orator renowned
In Athens or free Rome where eloquence
Flourished since mute to some great cause addressed
Stood in himself collected while each part
Motion each act won audience ere the tongue
Sometimes in highth began as no delay
Of preface brooking through his zeal of right
So standing moving or to highth up grown
The Tempter all impassioned thus began
O sacred wise and wisdom-giving Plant
Mother of science now I feel thy power
Within me clear not only to discern
Things in their causes but to trace the ways
Of highest agents deemed however wise
Queen of this universe do not believe
Those rigid threats of death ye shall not die
How should you by the fruit it gives you life
To knowledge by the threatener look on me
Me who have touched and tasted yet both live
And life more perfect have attained than Fate
Meant me by venturing higher than my lot
Shall that be shut to Man which to the Beast
Is open or will God incense his ire
For such a petty trespass and not praise
Rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain
Of death denounced whatever thing death be
Deterred not from achieving what might lead
To happier life knowledge of good and evil
Of good how just of evil if what is evil
Be real why not known since easier shunned
God therefore cannot hurt ye and be just
Not just not God not feared then nor obeyed
Your fear itself of death removes the fear
Why then was this forbid Why but to awe
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant
His worshippers He knows that in the day
Ye eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear
Yet are but dim shall perfectly be then
Opened and cleared and ye shall be as Gods
Knowing both good and evil as they know
That ye shall be as Gods since I as Man
Internal Man is but proportion meet
I of brute human ye of human Gods
So ye shall die perhaps by putting off
Human to put on Gods death to be wished
Though threatened which no worse than this can bring
And what are Gods that Man may not become
As they participating God-like food
The Gods are first and that advantage use
On our belief that all from them proceeds
I question it for this fair earth I see
Warmed by the sun producing every kind
Them nothing if they all things who enclosed
Knowledge of good and evil in this tree
That whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
Wisdom without their leave and wherein lies
The offence that Man should thus attain to know
What can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
Impart against his will if all be his
Or is it envy and can envy dwell
In heavenly breasts These these and many more
Causes import your need of this fair fruit
Goddess humane reach then and freely taste
He ended and his words replete with guile
Into her heart too easy entrance won
Fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold
Might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
Yet rung of his persuasive words impregned
With reason to her seeming and with truth
Mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked
An eager appetite raised by the smell
So savoury of that fruit which with desire
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste
Solicited her longing eye yet first
Pausing a while thus to herself she mused
Great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits
Though kept from man and worthy to be admired
Whose taste too long forborn at first assay
Gave elocution to the mute and taught
The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise
Thy praise he also who forbids thy use
Conceals not from us naming thee the tree
Of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil
Forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
Commends thee more while it infers the good
By thee communicated and our want
For good unknown sure is not had or had
And yet unknown is as not had at all
In plain then what forbids he but to know
Forbids us good forbids us to be wise
Such prohibitions bind not But if death
Bind us with after-bands what profits then
Our inward freedom In the day we eat
Of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die
How dies the Serpent he hath eaten and lives
And knows and speaks and reasons and discerns
Irrational till then For us alone
Was death invented or to us denied
This intellectual food for beasts reserved
For beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
Hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
The good befallen him author unsuspect
Friendly to man far from deceit or guile
What fear I then rather what know to fear
Under this ignorance of good and evil
Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told
But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed
On the other side Adam soon as he heard
The fatal trespass done by Eve amazed
Astonied stood and blank while horrour chill
Ran through his veins and all his joints relaxed
From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve
Down dropt and all the faded roses shed
Speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
First to himself he inward silence broke
O fairest of Creation last and best
Of all God works Creature in whom excelled
Whatever can to sight or thought be formed
Holy divine good amiable or sweet
How art thou lost how on a sudden lost
Defaced deflowered and now to death devote
Rather how hast thou yielded to transgress
The strict forbiddance how to violate
The sacred fruit forbidden Some cursed fraud
Of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown
And me with thee hath ruined for with thee
Certain my resolution is to die
How can I live without thee how forego
Thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined
To live again in these wild woods forlorn
Should God create another Eve and I
Another rib afford yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart no no I feel
The link of Nature draw me flesh of flesh
Bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
Mine never shall be parted bliss or woe
So having said as one from sad dismay
Recomforted and after thoughts disturbed
Submitting to what seemed remediless
Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned
Bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous Eve
And peril great provoked who thus hast dared
Had it been only coveting to eye
That sacred fruit sacred to abstinence
Much more to taste it under ban to touch
But past who can recall or done undo
Not God Omnipotent nor Fate yet so
Perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
Is not so heinous now foretasted fruit
Profaned first by the serpent by him first
Made common and unhallowed ere our taste
Nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives
Lives as thou saidst and gains to live as Man
Higher degree of life inducement strong
To us as likely tasting to attain
Proportional ascent which cannot be
But to be Gods or Angels demi-Gods
Nor can I think that God Creator wise
Though threatening will in earnest so destroy
Us his prime creatures dignified so high
Set over all his works which in our fall
For us created needs with us must fail
Dependant made so God shall uncreate
Be frustrate do undo and labour lose
Not well conceived of God who though his power
Creation could repeat yet would be loth
Us to abolish lest the Adversary
Triumph and say Fickle their state whom God
Most favours who can please him long Me first
He ruined now Mankind whom will he next
Matter of scorn not to be given the Foe
However I with thee have fixed my lot
Certain to undergo like doom If death
Consort with thee death is to me as life
So forcible within my heart I feel
The bond of Nature draw me to my own
My own in thee for what thou art is mine
Our state cannot be severed we are one
One flesh to lose thee were to lose myself
So Adam and thus Eve to him replied
O glorious trial of exceeding love
Illustrious evidence example high
Engaging me to emulate but short
Of thy perfection how shall I attain
Adam from whose dear side I boast me sprung
And gladly of our union hear thee speak
One heart one soul in both whereof good proof
This day affords declaring thee resolved
Rather than death or aught than death more dread
Shall separate us linked in love so dear
To undergo with me one guilt one crime
If any be of tasting this fair fruit
Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds
Direct or by occasion hath presented
This happy trial of thy love which else
So eminently never had been known
Were it I thought death menaced would ensue
This my attempt I would sustain alone
The worst and not persuade thee rather die
Deserted than oblige thee with a fact
Pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured
Remarkably so late of thy so true
So faithful love unequalled but I feel
Far otherwise the event not death but life
Augmented opened eyes new hopes new joys
Taste so divine that what of sweet before
Hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh
On my experience Adam freely taste
And fear of death deliver to the winds
So saying she embraced him and for joy
Tenderly wept much won that he his love
Had so ennobled as of choice to incur
Divine displeasure for her sake or death
In recompence for such compliance bad
Such recompence best merits from the bough
She gave him of that fair enticing fruit
With liberal hand he scrupled not to eat
Against his better knowledge not deceived
But fondly overcome with female charm
Earth trembled from her entrails as again
In pangs and Nature gave a second groan
Sky loured and muttering thunder some sad drops
Wept at completing of the mortal sin
Original while Adam took no thought
Eating his fill nor Eve to iterate
Her former trespass feared the more to sooth
Him with her loved society that now
As with new wine intoxicated both
They swim in mirth and fancy that they feel
Divinity within them breeding wings
Wherewith to scorn the earth But that false fruit
Far other operation first displayed
Carnal desire inflaming he on Eve
Began to cast lascivious eyes she him
As wantonly repaid in lust they burn
Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move
Eve now I see thou art exact of taste
And elegant of sapience no small part
Since to each meaning savour we apply
And palate call judicious I the praise
Yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed
Much pleasure we have lost while we abstained
From this delightful fruit nor known till now
True relish tasting if such pleasure be
In things to us forbidden it might be wished
For this one tree had been forbidden ten
But come so well refreshed now let us play
As meet is after such delicious fare
For never did thy beauty since the day
I saw thee first and wedded thee adorned
With all perfections so inflame my sense
With ardour to enjoy thee fairer now
Than ever bounty of this virtuous tree
So said he and forbore not glance or toy
Of amorous intent well understood
Of Eve whose eye darted contagious fire
Her hand he seised and to a shady bank
Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered
He led her nothing loth flowers were the couch
Pansies and violets and asphodel
And hyacinth Earth freshest softest lap
There they their fill of love and love disport
Took largely of their mutual guilt the seal
The solace of their sin till dewy sleep
Oppressed them wearied with their amorous play
Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit
That with exhilarating vapour bland
About their spirits had played and inmost powers
Made err was now exhaled and grosser sleep
Bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
Incumbered now had left them up they rose
As from unrest and each the other viewing
Soon found their eyes how opened and their minds
How darkened innocence that as a veil
Had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone
Just confidence and native righteousness
And honour from about them naked left
To guilty Shame he covered but his robe
Uncovered more So rose the Danite strong
Herculean Samson from the harlot-lap
Of Philistean Dalilah and waked
Shorn of his strength They destitute and bare
Of all their virtue Silent and in face
Confounded long they sat as strucken mute
Till Adam though not less than Eve abashed
At length gave utterance to these words constrained
O Eve in evil hour thou didst give ear
To that false worm of whomsoever taught
To counterfeit Man voice true in our fall
False in our promised rising since our eyes
Opened we find indeed and find we know
Mean while the heinous and despiteful act
Of Satan done in Paradise and how
He in the serpent had perverted Eve
Her husband she to taste the fatal fruit
Was known in Heaven for what can 'scape the eye
Of God all-seeing or deceive his heart
Omniscient who in all things wise and just
Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind
Of Man with strength entire and free will armed
Complete to have discovered and repulsed
Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend
For still they knew and ought to have still remembered
The high injunction not to taste that fruit
Whoever tempted which they not obeying
Incurred what could they less the penalty
And manifold in sin deserved to fall
Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste
The angelick guards ascended mute and sad
For Man for of his state by this they knew
Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen
Entrance unseen Soon as the unwelcome news
From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate displeased
All were who heard dim sadness did not spare
That time celestial visages yet mixed
With pity violated not their bliss
About the new-arrived in multitudes
The ethereal people ran to hear and know
How all befel They towards the throne supreme
Accountable made haste to make appear
With righteous plea their utmost vigilance
And easily approved when the Most High
Eternal Father from his secret cloud
Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice
Assembled Angels and ye Powers returned
From unsuccessful charge be not dismayed
Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth
Which your sincerest care could not prevent
Foretold so lately what would come to pass
When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell
I told ye then he should prevail and speed
On his bad errand Man should be seduced
And flattered out of all believing lies
Against his Maker no decree of mine
Concurring to necessitate his fall
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse
His free will to her own inclining left
In even scale But fallen he is and now
What rests but that the mortal sentence pass
On his transgression death denounced that day
Which he presumes already vain and void
Because not yet inflicted as he feared
By some immediate stroke but soon shall find
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end
Justice shall not return as bounty scorned
But whom send I to judge them whom but thee
Vicegerent Son To thee I have transferred
All judgement whether in Heaven or Earth or Hell
Easy it may be seen that I intend
Mercy colleague with justice sending thee
Man friend his Mediator his designed
Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary
And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen
So spake the Father and unfolding bright
Toward the right hand his glory on the Son
Blazed forth unclouded Deity He full
Resplendent all his Father manifest
Expressed and thus divinely answered mild
Father Eternal thine is to decree
Mine both in Heaven and Earth to do thy will
Supreme that thou in me thy Son beloved
Mayest ever rest well pleased I go to judge
On earth these thy transgressours but thou knowest
Whoever judged the worst on me must light
When time shall be for so I undertook
Before thee and not repenting this obtain
Of right that I may mitigate their doom
On me derived yet I shall temper so
Justice with mercy as may illustrate most
Them fully satisfied and thee appease
Attendance none shall need nor train where none
Are to behold the judgement but the judged
Those two the third best absent is condemned
Convict by flight and rebel to all law
Conviction to the serpent none belongs
Thus saying from his radiant seat he rose
Of high collateral glory Him Thrones and Powers
Princedoms and Dominations ministrant
Accompanied to Heaven-gate from whence
Eden and all the coast in prospect lay
Down he descended straight the speed of Gods
Time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged
Now was the sun in western cadence low
From noon and gentle airs due at their hour
To fan the earth now waked and usher in
The evening cool when he from wrath more cool
Came the mild Judge and Intercessour both
To sentence Man The voice of God they heard
Now walking in the garden by soft winds
Brought to their ears while day declined they heard
And from his presence hid themselves among
The thickest trees both man and wife till God
Approaching thus to Adam called aloud
Where art thou Adam wont with joy to meet
My coming seen far off I miss thee here
Not pleased thus entertained with solitude
Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought
Or come I less conspicuous or what change
Absents thee or what chance detains Come forth
He came and with him Eve more loth though first
To offend discountenanced both and discomposed
Love was not in their looks either to God
Or to each other but apparent guilt
And shame and perturbation and despair
Anger and obstinacy and hate and guile
Whence Adam faltering long thus answered brief
I heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
Afraid being naked hid myself To whom
The gracious Judge without revile replied
My voice thou oft hast heard and hast not feared
But still rejoiced how is it now become
So dreadful to thee That thou art naked who
Hath told thee Hast thou eaten of the tree
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat
To whom thus Adam sore beset replied
O Heaven in evil strait this day I stand
Xerxes the liberty of Greece to yoke
From Susa his Memnonian palace high
Came to the sea and over Hellespont
Bridging his way Europe with Asia joined
And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves
Now had they brought the work by wonderous art
Pontifical a ridge of pendant rock
Over the vexed abyss following the track
Of Satan to the self-same place where he
First lighted from his wing and landed safe
From out of Chaos to the outside bare
Of this round world With pins of adamant
And chains they made all fast too fast they made
And durable And now in little space
The confines met of empyrean Heaven
And of this World and on the left hand Hell
With long reach interposed three several ways
In sight to each of these three places led
And now their way to Earth they had descried
To Paradise first tending when behold
Satan in likeness of an Angel bright
Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering
His zenith while the sun in Aries rose
Disguised he came but those his children dear
Their parent soon discerned though in disguise
He after Eve seduced unminded slunk
Into the wood fast by and changing shape
To observe the sequel saw his guileful act
By Eve though all unweeting seconded
Upon her husband saw their shame that sought
Vain covertures but when he saw descend
The Son of God to judge them terrified
He fled not hoping to escape but shun
The present fearing guilty what his wrath
Might suddenly inflict that past returned
By night and listening where the hapless pair
Sat in their sad discourse and various plaint
Thence gathered his own doom which understood
Not instant but of future time with joy
And tidings fraught to Hell he now returned
And at the brink of Chaos near the foot
Of this new wonderous pontifice unhoped
Met who to meet him came his offspring dear
Great joy was at their meeting and at sight
Of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased
Long he admiring stood till Sin his fair
Enchanting daughter thus the silence broke
O Parent these are thy magnifick deeds
Thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own
Thou art their author and prime architect
For I no sooner in my heart divined
My heart which by a secret harmony
Still moves with thine joined in connexion sweet
That thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks
Now also evidence but straight I felt
Though distant from thee worlds between yet felt
That I must after thee with this thy son
Such fatal consequence unites us three
Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds
Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure
Detain from following thy illustrious track
Thou hast achieved our liberty confined
Within Hell-gates till now thou us impowered
To fortify thus far and overlay
With this portentous bridge the dark abyss
Thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won
What thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained
With odds what war hath lost and fully avenged
Our foil in Heaven here thou shalt monarch reign
There didst not there let him still victor sway
As battle hath adjudged from this new world
Retiring by his own doom alienated
And henceforth monarchy with thee divide
Of all things parted by the empyreal bounds
His quadrature from thy orbicular world
Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne
Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad
Fair Daughter and thou Son and Grandchild both
High proof ye now have given to be the race
Of Satan for I glory in the name
Antagonist of Heaven Almighty King
Amply have merited of me of all
The infernal empire that so near Heaven door
Triumphal with triumphal act have met
Mine with this glorious work and made one realm
Hell and this world one realm one continent
Of easy thorough-fare Therefore while I
Descend through darkness on your road with ease
To my associate Powers them to acquaint
With these successes and with them rejoice
You two this way among these numerous orbs
All yours right down to Paradise descend
There dwell and reign in bliss thence on the earth
Dominion exercise and in the air
Chiefly on Man sole lord of all declared
Him first make sure your thrall and lastly kill
My substitutes I send ye and create
Plenipotent on earth of matchless might
Issuing from me on your joint vigour now
My hold of this new kingdom all depends
Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit
If your joint power prevail the affairs of Hell
No detriment need fear go and be strong
So saying he dismissed them they with speed
Their course through thickest constellations held
Spreading their bane the blasted stars looked wan
And planets planet-struck real eclipse
Then suffered The other way Satan went down
The causey to Hell-gate On either side
Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed
And with rebounding surge the bars assailed
That scorned his indignation Through the gate
Wide open and unguarded Satan passed
And all about found desolate for those
Appointed to sit there had left their charge
Flown to the upper world the rest were all
Far to the inland retired about the walls
Of Pandemonium city and proud seat
Of Lucifer so by allusion called
Of that bright star to Satan paragoned
There kept their watch the legions while the Grand
In council sat solicitous what chance
Might intercept their emperour sent so he
Departing gave command and they observed
As when the Tartar from his Russian foe
By Astracan over the snowy plains
Retires or Bactrin Sophi from the horns
Of Turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond
The realm of Aladule in his retreat
To Tauris or Casbeen So these the late
Heaven-banished host left desart utmost Hell
Many a dark league reduced in careful watch
Round their metropolis and now expecting
Each hour their great adventurer from the search
Of foreign worlds He through the midst unmarked
In show plebeian Angel militant
Of lowest order passed and from the door
Of that Plutonian hall invisible
Ascended his high throne which under state
Of richest texture spread at the upper end
Was placed in regal lustre Down a while
He sat and round about him saw unseen
At last as from a cloud his fulgent head
And shape star-bright appeared or brighter clad
With what permissive glory since his fall
Was left him or false glitter All amazed
At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng
Bent their aspect and whom they wished beheld
Their mighty Chief returned loud was the acclaim
Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers
Raised from their dark Divan and with like joy
Congratulant approached him who with hand
Silence and with these words attention won
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
For in possession such not only of right
I call ye and declare ye now returned
Successful beyond hope to lead ye forth
Triumphant out of this infernal pit
Abominable accursed the house of woe
And dungeon of our tyrant Now possess
As Lords a spacious world to our native Heaven
Little inferiour by my adventure hard
With peril great achieved Long were to tell
What I have done what suffered with what pain
Voyaged th' unreal vast unbounded deep
Of horrible confusion over which
By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved
To expedite your glorious march but I
Toiled out my uncouth passage forced to ride
The untractable abyss plunged in the womb
Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild
That jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed
My journey strange with clamorous uproar
Protesting Fate supreme thence how I found
The new created world which fame in Heaven
Long had foretold a fabrick wonderful
Of absolute perfection therein Man
Placed in a Paradise by our exile
Made happy Him by fraud I have seduced
From his Creator and the more to encrease
Your wonder with an apple he thereat
Offended worth your laughter hath given up
Both his beloved Man and all his world
To Sin and Death a prey and so to us
Without our hazard labour or alarm
To range in and to dwell and over Man
To rule as over all he should have ruled
True is me also he hath judged or rather
Me not but the brute serpent in whose shape
Man I deceived that which to me belongs
Is enmity which he will put between
Me and mankind I am to bruise his heel
His seed when is not set shall bruise my head
A world who would not purchase with a bruise
Or much more grievous pain Ye have the account
Of my performance What remains ye Gods
But up and enter now into full bliss
So having said a while he stood expecting
Their universal shout and high applause
To fill his ear when contrary he hears
On all sides from innumerable tongues
A dismal universal hiss the sound
Of publick scorn he wondered but not long
Had leisure wondering at himself now more
His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare
His arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining
Each other till supplanted down he fell
A monstrous serpent on his belly prone
Reluctant but in vain a greater power
Now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned
According to his doom he would have spoke
But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
To forked tongue for now were all transformed
Alike to serpents all as accessories
To his bold riot Dreadful was the din
Of hissing through the hall thick swarming now
With complicated monsters head and tail
Scorpion and Asp and Amphisbaena dire
Cerastes horned Hydrus and Elops drear
And Dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon or the isle
Ophiusa but still greatest he the midst
Now Dragon grown larger than whom the sun
Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime
Huge Python and his power no less he seemed
Above the rest still to retain they all
Him followed issuing forth to the open field
Where all yet left of that revolted rout
Heaven-fallen in station stood or just array
Sublime with expectation when to see
In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief
They saw but other sight instead a croud
Of ugly serpents horrour on them fell
And horrid sympathy for what they saw
They felt themselves now changing down their arms
Down fell both spear and shield down they as fast
And the dire hiss renewed and the dire form
Catched by contagion like in punishment
As in their crime Thus was the applause they meant
Turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame
Cast on themselves from their own mouths There stood
A grove hard by sprung up with this their change
His will who reigns above to aggravate
Their penance laden with fair fruit like that
Which grew in Paradise the bait of Eve
Used by the Tempter on that prospect strange
Their earnest eyes they fixed imagining
For one forbidden tree a multitude
Now risen to work them further woe or shame
Yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce
Though to delude them sent could not abstain
But on they rolled in heaps and up the trees
Climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks
That curled Megaera greedily they plucked
The fruitage fair to sight like that which grew
Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed
This more delusive not the touch but taste
Deceived they fondly thinking to allay
Their appetite with gust instead of fruit
Chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste
With spattering noise rejected oft they assayed
Hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft
With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws
With soot and cinders filled so oft they fell
Into the same illusion not as Man
Whom they triumphed once lapsed Thus were they plagued
And worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss
Till their lost shape permitted they resumed
Yearly enjoined some say to undergo
This annual humbling certain numbered days
To dash their pride and joy for Man seduced
However some tradition they dispersed
Among the Heathen of their purchase got
And fabled how the Serpent whom they called
Ophion with Eurynome the wide 
Encroaching Eve perhaps had first the rule
Of high Olympus thence by Saturn driven
And Ops ere yet Dictaean Jove was born
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arrived Sin there in power before
Once actual now in body and to dwell
Habitual habitant behind her Death
Close following pace for pace not mounted yet
On his pale horse to whom Sin thus began
Second of Satan sprung all-conquering Death
What thinkest thou of our empire now though earned
With travel difficult not better far
Than still at Hell dark threshold to have sat watch
Unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved
Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon
To me who with eternal famine pine
Alike is Hell or Paradise or Heaven
There best where most with ravine I may meet
Which here though plenteous all too little seems
To stuff this maw this vast unhide-bound corps
To whom the incestuous mother thus replied
Thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers
Feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl
No homely morsels and whatever thing
The sithe of Time mows down devour unspared
Till I in Man residing through the race
His thoughts his looks words actions all infect
And season him thy last and sweetest prey
This said they both betook them several ways
Both to destroy or unimmortal make
All kinds and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later which the Almighty seeing
From his transcendent seat the Saints among
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice
See with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havock yonder world which I
So fair and good created and had still
Kept in that state had not the folly of Man
Let in these wasteful furies who impute
Folly to me so doth the Prince of Hell
And his adherents that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heavenly and conniving seem
To gratify my scornful enemies
That laugh as if transported with some fit
Of passion I to them had quitted all
At random yielded up to their misrule
And know not that I called and drew them thither
My Hell-hounds to lick up the draff and filth
Which Man polluting sin with taint hath shed
On what was pure til crammed and gorged nigh burst
With sucked and glutted offal at one sling
Of thy victorious arm well-pleasing Son
Both Sin and Death and yawning Grave at last
Through Chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of Hell
For ever and seal up his ravenous jaws
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure
To sanctity that shall receive no stain
Till then the curse pronounced on both precedes
He ended and the heavenly audience loud
Sung Halleluiah as the sound of seas
Through multitude that sung Just are thy ways
Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works
Who can extenuate thee Next to the Son
Destined Restorer of mankind by whom
New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise
Or down from Heaven descend Such was their song
While the Creator calling forth by name
His mighty Angels gave them several charge
As sorted best with present things The sun
Had first his precept so to move so shine
As might affect the earth with cold and heat
Scarce tolerable and from the north to call
Decrepit winter from the south to bring
Solstitial summer heat To the blanc moon
Her office they prescribed to the other five
Their planetary motions and aspects
In sextile square and trine and opposite
Of noxious efficacy and when to join
In synod unbenign and taught the fixed
Their influence malignant when to shower
Which of them rising with the sun or falling
Should prove tempestuous To the winds they set
Their corners when with bluster to confound
Sea air and shore the thunder when to roll
With terrour through the dark aereal hall
Some say he bid his Angels turn ascanse
The poles of earth twice ten degrees and more
From the sun axle they with labour pushed
Oblique the centrick globe Some say the sun
Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven
Atlantick Sisters and the Spartan Twins
Up to the Tropick Crab thence down amain
By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales
As deep as Capricorn to bring in change
Of seasons to each clime else had the spring
Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers
Equal in days and nights except to those
Beyond the polar circles to them day
Had unbenighted shone while the low sun
To recompense his distance in their sight
Had rounded still the horizon and not known
Or east or west which had forbid the snow
From cold Estotiland and south as far
Beneath Magellan At that tasted fruit
The sun as from Thyestean banquet turned
His course intended else how had the world
Inhabited though sinless more than now
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat
These changes in the Heavens though slow produced
Like change on sea and land sideral blast
Vapour and mist and exhalation hot
Corrupt and pestilent Now from the north
Of Norumbega and the Samoed shore
Bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice
And snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw
Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud
And Thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn
With adverse blast upturns them from the south
Notus and Afer black with thunderous clouds
From Serraliona thwart of these as fierce
Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds
Eurus and Zephyr with their lateral noise
Sirocco and Libecchio Thus began
Outrage from lifeless things but Discord first
Daughter of Sin among the irrational
Death introduced through fierce antipathy
Beast now with beast 'gan war and fowl with fowl
And fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving
Devoured each other nor stood much in awe
Of Man but fled him or with countenance grim
Glared on him passing These were from without
The growing miseries which Adam saw
Already in part though hid in gloomiest shade
To sorrow abandoned but worse felt within
And in a troubled sea of passion tost
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint
O miserable of happy Is this the end
Of this new glorious world and me so late
The glory of that glory who now become
Accursed of blessed hide me from the face
Of God whom to behold was then my highth
Of happiness Yet well if here would end
The misery I deserved it and would bear
REMOTE unfriended melancholy slow
Or by the lazy Scheldt or wandering Po
Or onward where the rude Carinthian boor
Against the houseless stranger shuts the door
Or where Campania plain forsaken lies 
A weary waste expanding to the skies
Where'er I roam whatever realms to see
My heart untravell'd fondly turns to thee
Still to my brother turns with ceaseless pain
And drags at each remove a lengthening chain 
Eternal blessings crown my earliest friend
And round his dwelling guardian saints attend
Bless'd be that spot where cheerful guests retire
To pause from toil and trim their ev'ning fire
Bless'd that abode where want and pain repair 
And every stranger finds a ready chair
Bless'd be those feasts with simple plenty crown'd
Where all the ruddy family around
Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail
Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale 
Or press the bashful stranger to his food
And learn the luxury of doing good
But me not destin'd such delights to share
My prime of life in wand'ring spent and care
Impell'd with steps unceasing to pursue 
Some fleeting good that mocks me with the view
That like the circle bounding earth and skies
Allures from far yet as I follow flies
My fortune leads to traverse realms alone
And find no spot of all the world my own 
E'en now where Alpine solitudes ascend
I sit me down a pensive hour to spend
And plac'd on high above the storm career
Look downward where a hundred realms appear
Lakes forests cities plains extending wide 
The pomp of kings the shepherd humbler pride
When thus Creation charms around combine
Amidst the store should thankless pride repine
Say should the philosophic mind disdain
That good which makes each humbler bosom vain 
Let school-taught pride dissemble all it can
These little things are great to little man
And wiser he whose sympathetic mind
Exults in all the good of all mankind
Ye glitt'ring towns with wealth and splendour crown'd 
Ye fields where summer spreads profusion round
Ye lakes whose vessels catch the busy gale
Ye bending swains that dress the flow'ry vale
For me your tributary stores combine
Creation heir the world the world is mine 
As some lone miser visiting his store
Bends at his treasure counts re-counts it o'er
Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill
Yet still he sighs for hoards are wanting still
Thus to my breast alternate passions rise 
Pleas'd with each good that heaven to man supplies
Yet oft a sigh prevails and sorrows fall
To see the hoard of human bliss so small
And oft I wish amidst the scene to find
Some spot to real happiness consign'd 
Where my worn soul each wand'ring hope at rest
May gather bliss to see my fellows bless'd
But where to find that happiest spot below
Who can direct when all pretend to know
The shudd'ring tenant of the frigid zone 
Boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own
Extols the treasures of his stormy seas
And his long nights of revelry and ease
The naked negro panting at the line
Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine 
Basks in the glare or stems the tepid wave
And thanks his gods for all the good they gave
Such is the patriot boast where'er we roam
His first best country ever is at home
And yet perhaps if countries we compare 
And estimate the blessings which they share
Though patriots flatter still shall wisdom find
An equal portion dealt to all mankind
As different good by Art or Nature given
To different nations makes their blessings even 
Nature a mother kind alike to all
Still grants her bliss at Labour earnest call
With food as well the peasant is supplied
On Idra cliffs as Arno shelvy side
And though the rocky-crested summits frown 
These rocks by custom turn to beds of down
From Art more various are the blessings sent
Wealth commerce honour liberty content
Yet these each other power so strong contest
That either seems destructive of the rest 
Where wealth and freedom reign contentment fails
And honour sinks where commerce long prevails
Hence every state to one lov'd blessing prone
Conforms and models life to that alone
Each to the favourite happiness attends 
And spurns the plan that aims at other ends
Till carried to excess in each domain
This favourite good begets peculiar pain
But let us try these truths with closer eyes
And trace them through the prospect as it lies 
Here for a while my proper cares resign'd
Here let me sit in sorrow for mankind
Like yon neglected shrub at random cast
That shades the steep and sighs at every blast
Far to the right where Apennine ascends 
Bright as the summer Italy extends
Its uplands sloping deck the mountain side
Woods over woods in gay theatric pride
While oft some temple mould'ring tops between
With venerable grandeur mark the scene 
Could Nature bounty satisfy the breast
The sons of Italy were surely blest
Whatever fruits in different climes were found
That proudly rise or humbly court the ground
Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear 
Whose bright succession decks the varied year
Whatever sweets salute the northern sky
With vernal lives that blossom but to die
These here disporting own the kindred soil
Nor ask luxuriance from the planter toil 
While sea-born gales their gelid wings expand
To winnow fragrance round the smiling land
But small the bliss that sense alone bestows
And sensual bliss is all the nation knows
In florid beauty groves and fields appear 
Man seems the only growth that dwindles here
Contrasted faults through all his manner reign
Though poor luxurious though submissive vain
Though grave yet trifling zealous yet untrue
And e'en in penance planning sins anew 
All evils here contaminate the mind
That opulence departed leaves behind
For wealth was theirs not far remov'd the date
When commerce proudly flourish'd through the state
At her command the palace learn'd to rise 
Again the long-fall'n column sought the skies
The canvas glow'd beyond e'en Nature warm
The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form
Till more unsteady than the southern gale
Commerce on other shores display'd her sail 
While nought remain'd of all that riches gave
But towns unmann'd and lords without a slave
And late the nation found with fruitless skill
Its former strength was but plethoric ill
Yet still the loss of wealth is here supplied 
By arts the splendid wrecks of former pride
From these the feeble heart and long-fall'n mind
An easy compensation seem to find
Here may be seen in bloodless pomp array'd
The paste-board triumph and the cavalcade 
Processions form'd for piety and love
A mistress or a saint in every grove
By sports like these are all their cares beguil'd
The sports of children satisfy the child
Each nobler aim repress'd by long control 
Now sinks at last or feebly mans the soul
While low delights succeeding fast behind
In happier meanness occupy the mind
As in those domes where Caesars once bore sway
Defac'd by time and tottering in decay 
There in the ruin heedless of the dead
The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed
And wond'ring man could want the larger pile
Exults and owns his cottage with a smile
My soul turn from them turn we to survey 
Where rougher climes a nobler race display
Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread
And force a churlish soil for scanty bread
No product here the barren hills afford
But man and steel the soldier and his sword 
No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array
But winter ling'ring chills the lap of May
No Zephyr fondly sues the mountain breast
But meteors glare and stormy glooms invest
Yet still e'en here content can spread a charm 
Redress the clime and all its rage disarm
Though poor the peasant hut his feasts though small
He sees his little lot the lot of all
Sees no contiguous palace rear its head
To shame the meanness of his humble shed 
No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal
To make him loathe his vegetable meal
But calm and bred in ignorance and toil
Each wish contracting fits him to the soil
Cheerful at morn he wakes from short repose 
Breasts the keen air and carols as he goes
With patient angle trolls the finny deep
Or drives his vent'rous plough-share to the steep
Or seeks the den where snow-tracks mark the way
And drags the struggling savage into day 
At night returning every labour sped
He sits him down the monarch of a shed
Smiles by his cheerful fire and round surveys
His children looks that brighten at the blaze
While his lov'd partner boastful of her hoard 
Displays her cleanly platter on the board
And haply too some pilgrim thither led
With many a tale repays the nightly bed
Thus every good his native wilds impart
Imprints the patriot passion on his heart
And e'en those ills that round his mansion rise
Enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies
Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms
And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms
And as a child when scaring sounds molest 
Clings close and closer to the mother breast
So the loud torrent and the whirlwind roar
But bind him to his native mountains more
Such are the charms to barren states assign'd
Their wants but few their wishes all confin'd 
Yet let them only share the praises due
If few their wants their pleasures are but few
For every want that stimulates the breast
Becomes a source of pleasure when redrest
Whence from such lands each pleasing science flies 
That first excites desire and then supplies
Unknown to them when sensual pleasures cloy
To fill the languid pause with finer joy
Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame
Catch every nerve and vibrate through the frame 
Their level life is but a smould'ring fire
Unquench'd by want unfann'd by strong desire
Unfit for raptures or if raptures cheer
On some high festival of once a year
In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire 
Till buried in debauch the bliss expire
But not their joys alone thus coarsely flow
Their morals like their pleasures are but low
For as refinement stops from sire to son
Unalter'd unimprov'd the manners run 
And love and friendship finely pointed dart
Fall blunted from each indurated heart
Some sterner virtues o'er the mountain breast
May sit like falcons cow'ring on the nest
But all the gentler morals such as play 
Through life more cultur'd walks and charm the way
These far dispers'd on timorous pinions fly
To sport and flutter in a kinder sky
To kinder skies where gentler manners reign
I turn and France displays her bright domain 
Gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease
Pleas'd with thyself whom all the world can please
How often have I led thy sportive choir
With tuneless pipe beside the murmuring Loire
Where shading elms along the margin grew 
And freshen'd from the wave the Zephyr flew
And haply though my harsh touch falt'ring still
But mock'd all tune and marr'd the dancer skill
Yet would the village praise my wondrous power
And dance forgetful of the noon-tide hour 
Alike all ages Dames of ancient days
Have led their children through the mirthful maze
And the gay grandsire skill'd in gestic lore
Has frisk'd beneath the burthen of threescore
So bless'd a life these thoughtless realms display 
Thus idly busy rolls their world away
Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear
For honour forms the social temper here
Honour that praise which real merit gains
Or e'en imaginary worth obtains 
Here passes current paid from hand to hand
It shifts in splendid traffic round the land
From courts to camps to cottages it strays
And all are taught an avarice of praise
They please are pleas'd they give to get esteem 
Till seeming bless'd they grow to what they seem
But while this softer art their bliss supplies
It gives their follies also room to rise
For praise too dearly lov'd or warmly sought
Enfeebles all internal strength of thought 
And the weak soul within itself unblest
Leans for all pleasure on another breast
Hence ostentation here with tawdry art
Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart
Here vanity assumes her pert grimace 
And trims her robes of frieze with copper lace
Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer
To boast one splendid banquet once a year
The mind still turns where shifting fashion draws
Nor weighs the solid worth of self-applause 
To men of other minds my fancy flies
Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies
Methinks her patient sons before me stand
Where the broad ocean leans against the land
And sedulous to stop the coming tide 
Lift the tall rampire artificial pride
Onward methinks and diligently slow
The firm-connected bulwark seems to grow
Spreads its long arms amidst the wat'ry roar
Scoops out an empire and usurps the shore 
While the pent ocean rising o'er the pile
Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile
The slow canal the yellow-blossom'd vale
The willow-tufted bank the gliding sail
The crowded mart the cultivated plain 
A new creation rescu'd from his reign
Thus while around the wave-subjected soil
Impels the native to repeated toil
Industrious habits in each bosom reign
And industry begets a love of gain 
Hence all the good from opulence that springs
With all those ills superfluous treasure brings
Are here displayed Their much-lov'd wealth imparts
Convenience plenty elegance and arts
But view them closer craft and fraud appear 
E'en liberty itself is barter'd here
At gold superior charms all freedom flies
The needy sell it and the rich man buys
A land of tyrants and a den of slaves
Here wretches seek dishonourable graves 
And calmly bent to servitude conform
Dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm
Heavens how unlike their Belgic sires of old
Rough poor content ungovernably bold
War in each breast and freedom on each brow 
How much unlike the sons of Britain now
Fir'd at the sound my genius spreads her wing
And flies where Britain courts the western spring
Where lawns extend that scorn Arcadian pride
And brighter streams than fam'd Hydaspes glide 
There all around the gentlest breezes stray
There gentle music melts on ev'ry spray
Creation mildest charms are there combin'd
Extremes are only in the master mind
Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state 
With daring aims irregularly great
Pride in their port defiance in their eye
I see the lords of human kind pass by
Intent on high designs a thoughtful band
By forms unfashion'd fresh from Nature hand 
Fierce in their native hardiness of soul
True to imagin'd right above control
While e'en the peasant boasts these rights to scan
And learns to venerate himself as man
Thine Freedom thine the blessings pictur'd here 
Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear
Too bless'd indeed were such without alloy
But foster'd e'en by Freedom ills annoy
That independence Britons prize too high
Keeps man from man and breaks the social tie 
The self-dependent lordlings stand alone
All claims that bind and sweeten life unknown
Here by the bonds of nature feebly held
Minds combat minds repelling and repell'd
Ferments arise imprison'd factions roar 
Repress'd ambition struggles round her shore
Till over-wrought the general system feels
Its motions stop or frenzy fire the wheels
Nor this the worst As nature ties decay
As duty love and honour fail to sway 
Fictitious bonds the bonds of wealth and law
Still gather strength and force unwilling awe
Hence all obedience bows to these alone
And talent sinks and merit weeps unknown
Time may come when stripp'd of all her charms 
The land of scholars and the nurse of arms
Where noble stems transmit the patriot flame
Where kings have toil'd and poets wrote for fame
One sink of level avarice shall lie
And scholars soldiers kings unhonour'd die 
Yet think not thus when Freedom ills I state
I mean to flatter kings or court the great
Ye powers of truth that bid my soul aspire
Far from my bosom drive the low desire
And thou fair Freedom taught alike to feel 
The rabble rage and tyrant angry steel
Thou transitory flower alike undone
By proud contempt or favour fostering sun
Still may thy blooms the changeful clime endure
I only would repress them to secure 
For just experience tells in every soil
That those who think must govern those that toil
And all that freedom highest aims can reach
Is but to lay proportion'd loads on each
Hence should one order disproportion'd grow 
Its double weight must ruin all below
O then how blind to all that truth requires
Who think it freedom when a part aspires
Calm is my soul nor apt to rise in arms
Except when fast-approaching danger warms 
But when contending chiefs blockade the throne
Contracting regal power to stretch their own
When I behold a factious band agree
To call it freedom when themselves are free
Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw 
Laws grind the poor and rich men rule the law
The wealth of climes where savage nations roam
Pillag'd from slaves to purchase slaves at home
Fear pity justice indignation start
Tear off reserve and bare my swelling heart 
Till half a patriot half a coward grown
I fly from petty tyrants to the throne
Yes brother curse with me that baleful hour
When first ambition struck at regal power
And thus polluting honour in its source 
Gave wealth to sway the mind with double force
Have we not seen round Britain peopled shore
Her useful sons exchang'd for useless ore
Seen all her triumphs but destruction haste
Like flaring tapers bright'ning as they waste 
Seen opulence her grandeur to maintain
Lead stern depopulation in her train
And over fields where scatter'd hamlets rose
In barren solitary pomp repose
Have we not seen at pleasure lordly call 
The smiling long-frequented village fall
Beheld the duteous son the sire decay'd
The modest matron and the blushing maid
Forc'd from their homes a melancholy train
To traverse climes beyond the western main 
Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around
And Niagara stuns with thund'ring sound
E'en now perhaps as there some pilgrim strays
Through tangled forests and through dangerous ways
Where beasts with man divided empire claim 
And the brown Indian marks with murd'rous aim
There while above the giddy tempest flies
And all around distressful yells arise
The pensive exile bending with his woe
To stop too fearful and too faint to go 
Casts a long look where England glories shine
And bids his bosom sympathise with mine
Vain very vain my weary search to find
That bliss which only centres in the mind
Why have I stray'd from pleasure and repose 
To seek a good each government bestows
In every government though terrors reign
Though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain
How small of all that human hearts endure
That part which laws or kings can cause or cure 
Still to ourselves in every place consign'd
Our own felicity we make or find
With secret course which no loud storms annoy
Glides the smooth current of domestic joy
The lifted axe the agonising wheel 
Luke iron crown and Damiens' bed of steel
To men remote from power but rarely known
Leave reason faith and conscience all our own
SWEET AUBURN loveliest village of the plain
Where health and plenty cheer'd the labouring swain
Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid
And parting summer lingering blooms delay'd
Dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease 
Seats of my youth when every sport could please
How often have I loiter'd o'er thy green
Where humble happiness endear'd each scene
How often have I paus'd on every charm
The shelter'd cot the cultivated farm 
The never-failing brook the busy mill
The decent church that topp'd the neighbouring hill
The hawthorn bush with seats beneath the shade
For talking age and whisp'ring lovers made
How often have I bless'd the coming day 
When toil remitting lent its turn to play
And all the village train from labour free
Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree
While many a pastime circled in the shade
The young contending as the old survey'd 
And many a gambol frolick'd o'er the ground
And sleights of art and feats of strength went round
And still as each repeated pleasure tir'd
Succeeding sports the mirthful band inspir'd
The dancing pair that simply sought renown 
By holding out to tire each other down
The swain mistrustless of his smutted face
While secret laughter titter'd round the place
The bashful virgin side-long looks of love
The matron glance that would those looks reprove 
These were thy charms sweet village sports like these
With sweet succession taught e'en toil to please
These round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed
These were thy charms But all these charms are fled
Sweet smiling village loveliest of the lawn 
Thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn
Amidst thy bowers the tyrant hand is seen
And desolation saddens all thy green
One only master grasps the whole domain
And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain 
No more thy glassy brook reflects the day
But chok'd with sedges works its weedy way
Along thy glades a solitary guest
The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest
Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies 
And tires their echoes with unvaried cries
Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all
And the long grass o'ertops the mould'ring wall
And trembling shrinking from the spoiler hand
Far far away thy children leave the land 
Ill fares the land to hast'ning ills a prey
Where wealth accumulates and men decay
Princes and lords may flourish or may fade
A breath can make them as a breath has made
But a bold peasantry their country pride 
When once destroy'd can never be supplied
A time there was ere England griefs began
When every rood of ground maintain'd its man
For him light labour spread her wholesome store
Just gave what life requir'd but gave no more 
His best companions innocence and health
And his best riches ignorance of wealth
But times are alter'd trade unfeeling train
Usurp the land and dispossess the swain
Along the lawn where scatter'd hamlets rose 
Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose
And every want to opulence allied
And every pang that folly pays to pride
Those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom
Those calm desires that ask'd but little room 
Those healthful sports that grac'd the peaceful scene
Liv'd in each look and brighten'd all the green
These far departing seek a kinder shore
And rural mirth and manners are no more
Sweet AUBURN parent of the blissful hour 
Thy glades forlorn confess the tyrant power
Here as I take my solitary rounds
Amidst thy tangling walks and ruin'd grounds
And many a year elaps'd return to view
Where once the cottage stood the hawthorn grew 
Remembrance wakes with all her busy train
Swells at my breast and turns the past to pain
In all my wand'rings round this world of care
In all my griefs and GOD has given my share 
I still had hopes my latest hours to crown 
Amidst these humble bowers to lay me down
To husband out life taper at the close
And keep the flame from wasting by repose
I still had hopes for pride attends us still
Amidst the swains to show my book-learn'd skill 
Around my fire an evening group to draw
And tell of all I felt and all I saw
And as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue
Pants to the place from whence at first she flew
I still had hopes my long vexations pass'd 
Here to return and die at home at last
O blest retirement friend to life decline
Retreats from care that never must be mine
How happy he who crowns in shades like these
A youth of labour with an age of ease 
Who quits a world where strong temptations try
And since 'tis hard to combat learns to fly
For him no wretches born to work and weep
Explore the mine or tempt the dangerous deep
No surly porter stands in guilty state 
To spurn imploring famine from the gate
But on he moves to meet his latter end
Angels around befriending Virtue friend
Bends to the grave with unperceiv'd decay
While Resignation gently slopes the way 
And all his prospects bright'ning to the last
His Heaven commences ere the world be pass'd
Sweet was the sound when oft at evening close
Up yonder hill the village murmur rose
There as I pass'd with careless steps and slow 
The mingling notes came soften'd from below
The swain responsive as the milk-maid sung
The sober herd that low'd to meet their young
The noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool
The playful children just let loose from school 
The watchdog voice that bay'd the whisp'ring wind
And the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind
These all in sweet confusion sought the shade
And fill'd each pause the nightingale had made
But now the sounds of population fail 
No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale
No busy steps the grass-grown foot-way tread
For all the bloomy flush of life is fled
All but yon widow'd solitary thing
That feebly bends beside the plashy spring 
She wretched matron forc'd in age for bread
To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread
To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn
To seek her nightly shed and weep till morn
She only left of all the harmless train 
The sad historian of the pensive plain
Near yonder copse where once the garden smil'd
And still where many a garden flower grows wild
There where a few torn shrubs the place disclose
The village preacher modest mansion rose 
A man he was to all the country dear
And passing rich with forty pounds a year
Remote from towns he ran his godly race
Nor e'er had chang'd nor wished to change his place
Unpractis'd he to fawn or seek for power 
By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour
Far other aims his heart had learned to prize
More skill'd to raise the wretched than to rise
His house was known to all the vagrant train
He chid their wand'rings but reliev'd their pain 
The long-remember'd beggar was his guest
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast
The ruin'd spendthrift now no longer proud
Claim'd kindred there and had his claims allow'd
The broken soldier kindly bade to stay 
Sat by his fire and talk'd the night away
Wept o'er his wounds or tales of sorrow done
Shoulder'd his crutch and show'd how fields were won
Pleas'd with his guests the good man learn'd to glow
And quite forgot their vices in their woe 
Careless their merits or their faults to scan
His pity gave ere charity began
Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride
And e'en his failings lean'd to Virtue side
But in his duty prompt at every call 
He watch'd and wept he pray'd and felt for all
And as a bird each fond endearment tries
To tempt its new-fledg'd offspring to the skies
He tried each art reprov'd each dull delay
Allur'd to brighter worlds and led the way 
Beside the bed where parting life was laid
And sorrow guilt and pain by turns dismay'd
The reverend champion stood At his control
Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul
Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise 
And his last falt'ring accents whisper'd praise
At church with meek and unaffected grace
His looks adorn'd the venerable place
Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway
And fools who came to scoff remain'd to pray 
The service pass'd around the pious man
With steady zeal each honest rustic ran
Even children follow'd with endearing wile
And pluck'd his gown to share the good man smile
His ready smile a parent warmth express'd 
Their welfare pleas'd him and their cares distress'd
To them his heart his love his griefs were given
But all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven
As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form
Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm 
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread
Eternal sunshine settles on its head
Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way
With blossom'd furze unprofitably gay
There in his noisy mansion skill'd to rule 
The village master taught his little school
A man severe he was and stern to view
I knew him well and every truant knew
Well had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace
The day disasters in his morning face 
Full well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee
At all his jokes for many a joke had he
Full well the busy whisper circling round
Convey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd
Yet he was kind or if severe in aught 
The love he bore to learning was in fault
The village all declar'd how much he knew
'Twas certain he could write and cypher too
Lands he could measure terms and tides presage
And e'en the story ran that he could gauge 
In arguing too the parson own'd his skill
For e'en though vanquish'd he could argue still
While words of learned length and thund'ring sound
Amazed the gazing rustics rang'd around
And still they gaz'd and still the wonder grew 
That one small head could carry all he knew
But past is all his fame The very spot
Where many a time he triumph'd is forgot
Near yonder thorn that lifts its head on high
Where once the sign-post caught the passing eye 
Low lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspir'd
Where grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retir'd
Where village statesmen talk'd with looks profound
And news much older than their ale went round
Imagination fondly stoops to trace 
The parlour splendours of that festive place
The white-wash'd wall the nicely sanded floor
The varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door
The chest contriv'd a double debt to pay
A bed by night a chest of drawers by day 
The pictures plac'd for ornament and use
The twelve good rules the royal game of goose
The hearth except when winter chill'd the day
With aspen boughs and flowers and fennel gay
While broken tea-cups wisely kept for show 
Rang'd o'er the chimney glisten'd in a row
Vain transitory splendours Could not all
Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall
Obscure it sinks nor shall it more impart
An hour importance to the poor man heart 
Thither no more the peasant shall repair
To sweet oblivion of his daily care
No more the farmer news the barber tale
No more the wood-man ballad shall prevail
No more the smith his dusky brown shall clear 
Relax his pond'rous strength and lean to hear
The host himself no longer shall be found
Careful to see the mantling bliss go round
Nor the coy maid half willing to be press'd
Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest 
Yes let the rich deride the proud disdain
These simple blessings of the lowly train
To me more dear congenial to my heart
One native charm than all the gloss of art
Spontaneous joys where Nature has its play 
The soul adopts and owns their first-born sway
Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind
Unenvied unmolested unconfin'd
But the long pomp the midnight masquerade
With all the freaks of wanton wealth array'd 
In these ere triflers half their wish obtain
The toiling pleasure sickens into pain
And e'en while fashion brightest arts decoy
The heart distrusting asks if this be joy
Ye friends to truth ye statesmen who survey 
The rich man joys increase the poor decay
'Tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand
Between a splendid and a happy land
Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore
And shouting Folly hails them from her shore 
Hoards e'en beyond the miser wish abound
And rich men flock from all the world around
Yet count our gains This wealth is but a name
That leaves our useful products still the same
Nor so the loss The man of wealth and pride 
Takes up a space that many poor supplied
Space for his lake his park extended bounds
Space for his horses equipage and hounds
The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth
Has robb'd the neighbouring fields of half their growth 
His seat where solitary sports are seen
Indignant spurns the cottage from the green
Around the world each needful product flies
For all the luxuries the world supplies
While thus the land adorn'd for pleasure all 
In barren splendour feebly waits the fall
As some fair female unadorn'd and plain
Secure to please while youth confirms her reign
Slights every borrow'd charm that dress supplies
Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes 
But when those charms are pass'd for charms are frail
When time advances and when lovers fail
She then shines forth solicitous to bless
In all the glaring impotence of dress
Thus fares the land by luxury betray'd 
In nature simplest charms at first array'd
But verging to decline its splendours rise
Its vistas strike its palaces surprise
While scourg'd by famine from the smiling land
The mournful peasant leads his humble band 
And while he sinks without one arm to save
The country blooms a garden and a grave
Where then ah where shall poverty reside
To 'scape the pressure of continuous pride
If to some common fenceless limits stray'd 
He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade
Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide
And e'en the bare-worn common is denied
If to the city sped What waits him there
To see profusion that he must not share 
To see ten thousand baneful arts combin'd
To pamper luxury and thin mankind
To see those joys the sons of pleasure know
Extorted from his fellow creature woe
Here while the courtier glitters in brocade 
There the pale artist plies the sickly trade
Here while the proud their long-drawn pomps display
There the black gibbet glooms beside the way
The dome where Pleasure holds her midnight reign
Here richly deck'd admits the gorgeous train 
Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square
The rattling chariots clash the torches glare
Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy
Sure these denote one universal joy
Are these thy serious thoughts Ah turn thine eyes 
Where the poor houseless shiv'ring female lies
She once perhaps in village plenty bless'd
Has wept at tales of innocence distress'd
Her modest looks the cottage might adorn
Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn 
Now lost to all her friends her virtue fled
Near her betrayer door she lays her head
And pinch'd with cold and shrinking from the shower
With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour
When idly first ambitious of the town 
She left her wheel and robes of country brown
Do thine sweet AUBURN thine the loveliest train
Do thy fair tribes participate her pain
E'en now perhaps by cold and hunger led
At proud men doors they ask a little bread 
Ah no To distant climes a dreary scene
Where half the convex world intrudes between
Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go
Where wild Altama murmurs to their woe
Far different there from all that charm'd before 
The various terrors of that horrid shore
Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray
And fiercely shed intolerable day
Those matted woods where birds forget to sing
But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling 
Those pois'nous fields with rank luxuriance crown'd
Where the dark scorpion gathers death around
Where at each step the stranger fears to wake
The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake
Where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey 
And savage men more murd'rous still than they
While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies
Mingling the ravag'd landscape with the skies
Far different these from every former scene
The cooling brook the grassy-vested green 
The breezy covert of the warbling grove
That only shelter'd thefts of harmless love
Good heaven what sorrows gloom'd that parting day
That call'd them from their native walks away
When the poor exiles every pleasure pass'd 
Hung round their bowers and fondly look'd their last
And took a long farewell and wish'd in vain
For seats like these beyond the western main
And shudd'ring still to face the distant deep
Return'd and wept and still return'd to weep 
The good old sire the first prepar'd to go
To new-found worlds and wept for others' woe
But for himself in conscious virtue brave
He only wish'd for worlds beyond the grave
His lovely daughter lovlier in her tears 
The fond companion of his helpless years
Silent went next neglectful of her charms
And left a lover for a father arms
With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes
And bless'd the cot where every pleasure rose 
And kiss'd her thoughtless babes with many a tear
And clasp'd them close in sorrow doubly dear
Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief
In all the silent manliness of grief
O Luxury thou curs'd by Heaven decree 
How ill exchang'd are things like these for thee
How do thy potions with insidious joy
Diffuse their pleasures only to destroy
Kingdoms by thee to sickly greatness grown
Boast of a florid vigour not their own 
At every draught more large and large they grow
A bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe
Till sapp'd their strength and every part unsound
Down down they sink and spread a ruin round
E'en now the devastation is begun 
And half the business of destruction done
E'en now methinks as pond'ring here I stand
I see the rural virtues leave the land
Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail
That idly waiting flaps with ev'ry gale 
Downward they move a melancholy band
Pass from the shore and darken all the strand
Contented toil and hospitable care
And kind connubial tenderness are there
And piety with wishes plac'd above 
And steady loyalty and faithful love
And thou sweet Poetry thou loveliest maid
Still first to fly where sensual joys invade
Unfit in these degenerate times of shame
To catch the heart or strike for honest fame 
Dear charming nymph neglected and decried
My shame in crowds my solitary pride
Thou source of all my bliss and all my woe
That found'st me poor at first and keep'st me so
Thou guide by which the nobler arts excel 
Thou nurse of every virtue fare thee well
Farewell and Oh where'er thy voice be tried
On Torno cliffs or Pambamarca side
Whether where equinoctial fervours glow
Or winter wraps the polar world in snow 
Still let thy voice prevailing over time
Redress the rigours of th' inclement clime
Aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain
Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain
Teach him that states of native strength possess'd 
Though very poor may still be very bless'd
That trade proud empire hastes to swift decay
As ocean sweeps the labour'd mole away
While self-dependent power can time defy
As rocks resist the billows and the sky 
WHAT no way left to shun th' inglorious stage
And save from infamy my sinking age
Scarce half alive oppress'd with many a year
What in the name of dotage drives me here
A time there was when glory was my guide 
Nor force nor fraud could turn my steps aside
Unaw'd by pow'r and unappall'd by fear
With honest thrift I held my honour dear
But this vile hour disperses all my store
And all my hoard of honour is no more 
For ah too partial to my life decline
Caesar persuades submission must be mine
Him I obey whom heaven itself obeys
Hopeless of pleasing yet inclin'd to please
Here then at once I welcome every shame 
And cancel at threescore a life of fame
No more my titles shall my children tell
The old buffoon will fit my name as well
This day beyond its term my fate extends
For life is ended when our honour ends 
'Tis hard to say if greater want of skill
Appear in writing or in judging ill
But of the two less dang'rous is th' offence
To tire our patience than mislead our sense
Some few in that but numbers err in this 
Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss
A fool might once himself alone expose
Now one in verse makes many more in prose
'Tis with our judgments as our watches none
Go just alike yet each believes his own 
In Poets as true genius is but rare
True Taste as seldom is the Critic share
Both must alike from Heav'n derive their light
These born to judge as well as those to write
Let such teach others who themselves excel 
And censure freely who have written well
Authors are partial to their wit 'tis true
But are not Critics to their judgment too
Yet if we look more closely we shall find
Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind 
Nature affords at least a glimm'ring light
The lines tho' touch'd but faintly are drawn right
But as the slightest sketch if justly trac'd 
Is by ill-colouring but the more disgrac'd 
So by false learning is good sense defac'd 
Some are bewilder'd in the maze of schools
And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools
In search of wit these lose their common sense
And then turn Critics in their own defence
Each burns alike who can or cannot write 
Or with a Rival or an Eunuch spite
All fools have still an itching to deride
And fain would be upon the laughing side
If Maevius scribble in Apollo spite
There are who judge still worse than he can write 
Some have at first for Wits then Poets past
Turn'd Critics next and prov'd plain fools at last
Some neither can for Wits nor Critics pass
As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass
Those half-learn'd witlings num'rous in our isle 
As half-form'd insects on the banks of Nile
Unfinish'd things one knows not what to call
Their generation so equivocal
To tell 'em would a hundred tongues require
Or one vain wit that might a hundred tire 
But you who seek to give and merit fame
And justly bear a Critic noble name
Be sure yourself and your own reach to know
How far your genius taste and learning go
Launch not beyond your depth but be discreet 
And mark that point where sense and dulness meet
Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit
And wisely curb'd proud man pretending wit
As on the land while here the ocean gains
In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains 
Thus in the soul while memory prevails
The solid pow'r of understanding fails
Where beams of warm imagination play
The memory soft figures melt away
One science only will one genius fit 
So vast is art so narrow human wit
Not only bounded to peculiar arts
But oft in those confin'd to single parts
Like kings we lose the conquests gain'd before
By vain ambition still to make them more 
Each might his sev'ral province well command
Would all but stoop to what they understand
First follow Nature and your judgment frame
By her just standard which is still the same
Unerring NATURE still divinely bright 
One clear unchang'd and universal light
Life force and beauty must to all impart
At once the source and end and test of Art
Art from that fund each just supply provides
Works without show and without pomp presides 
In some fair body thus th' informing soul
With spirits feeds with vigour fills the whole
Each motion guides and ev'ry nerve sustains
Itself unseen but in th' effects remains
Some to whom Heav'n in wit has been profuse 
Want as much more to turn it to its use
For wit and judgment often are at strife
Tho' meant each other aid like man and wife
'T is more to guide than spur the Muse steed
Restrain his fury than provoke his speed 
The winged courser like a gen'rous horse
Shows most true mettle when you check his course
Those RULES of old discovered not devis'd
Are Nature still but Nature methodiz'd
Nature like liberty is but restrain'd 
By the same laws which first herself ordain'd
Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites
When to repress and when indulge our flights
High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd
And pointed out those arduous paths they trod 
Held from afar aloft th' immortal prize
And urg'd the rest by equal steps to rise
Just precepts thus from great examples giv'n
She drew from them what they deriv'd from Heav'n
The gen'rous Critic fann'd the Poet fire 
And taught the world with reason to admire
Then Criticism the Muse handmaid prov'd
To dress her charms and make her more belov'd
But following wits from that intention stray'd
Who could not win the mistress woo'd the maid 
Against the Poets their own arms they turn'd
Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd
So modern 'Pothecaries taught the art
By Doctor bills to play the Doctor part
Bold in the practice of mistaken rules 
Prescribe apply and call their masters fools
Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey
Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they
Some drily plain without invention aid
Write dull receipts how poems may be made 
These leave the sense their learning to display
And those explain the meaning quite away
You then whose judgment the right course would steer
Know well each ANCIENT'S proper character
His fable subject scope in ev'ry page 
Religion Country genius of his Age
Without all these at once before your eyes
Cavil you may but never criticize
Be Homer works your study and delight
Read them by day and meditate by night 
Thence form your judgment thence your maxims bring
And trace the Muses upward to their spring
Still with itself compar'd his text peruse
And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse
When first young Maro in his boundless mind 
A work t' outlast immortal Rome design'd
Perhaps he seem'd above the critic law
And but from Nature fountains scorn'd to draw
But when t' examine ev'ry part he came
Nature and Homer were he found the same 
Convinc'd amaz'd he checks the bold design
And rules as strict his labour'd work confine
As if the Stagirite o'erlook'd each line
Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem
To copy nature is to copy them 
Some beauties yet no Precepts can declare
For there a happiness as well as care
Music resembles Poetry in each
Are nameless graces which no methods teach
And which a master-hand alone can reach 
If where the rules not far enough extend
Since rules were made but to promote their end
Some lucky Licence answer to the full
Th' intent propos'd that Licence is a rule
Thus Pegasus a nearer way to take 
May boldly deviate from the common track
From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part
And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art
Which without passing thro' the judgment gains
The heart and all its end at once attains 
In prospects thus some objects please our eyes
Which out of nature common order rise
The shapeless rock or hanging precipice
Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend
And rise to faults true Critics dare not mend 
But tho' the Ancients thus their rules invade
As Kings dispense with laws themselves have made
Moderns beware or if you must offend
Against the precept ne'er transgress its End
Let it be seldom and compell'd by need 
And have at least their precedent to plead
The Critic else proceeds without remorse
Seizes your fame and puts his laws in force
I know there are to whose presumptuous thoughts
Those freer beauties ev'n in them seem faults 
Some figures monstrous and mis-shap'd appear
Consider'd singly or beheld too near
Which but proportion'd to their light or place
Due distance reconciles to form and grace
A prudent chief not always must display 
His pow'rs in equal ranks and fair array
But with th' occasion and the place comply
Conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly
Those oft are stratagems which error seem
Nor is it Homer nods but we that dream 
Still green with bays each ancient Altar stands
Above the reach of sacrilegious hands
Secure from Flames from Envy fiercer rage
Destructive War and all-involving Age
See from each clime the learn'd their incense bring 
Hear in all tongues consenting Paeans ring
In praise so just let ev'ry voice be join'd
And fill the gen'ral chorus of mankind
Hail Bards triumphant born in happier days
Immortal heirs of universal praise 
Whose honours with increase of ages grow
As streams roll down enlarging as they flow
Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound
And worlds applaud that must not yet be found
Oh may some spark of your celestial fire 
The last the meanest of your sons inspire
That on weak wings from far pursues your flights
Glows while he reads but trembles as he writes
To teach vain Wits a science little known
T' admire superior sense and doubt their own 
Of all the Causes which conspire to blind
Man erring judgment and misguide the mind
What the weak head with strongest bias rules
Is Pride the never-failing voice of fools
Whatever nature has in worth denied 
She gives in large recruits of needful pride
For as in bodies thus in souls we find
What wants in blood and spirits swell'd with wind
Pride where wit fails steps in to our defence
And fills up all the mighty Void of sense 
If once right reason drives that cloud away
Truth breaks upon us with resistless day
Trust not yourself but your defects to know
Make use of ev'ry friend and ev'ry foe
A little learning is a dang'rous thing 
Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring
There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain
And drinking largely sobers us again
Fir'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts
In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts 
While from the bounded level of our mind
Short views we take nor see the lengths behind
But more advanc'd behold with strange surprise
New distant scenes of endless science rise
So pleas'd at first the tow'ring Alps we try 
Mount o'er the vales and seem to tread the sky
Th' eternal snows appear already past
And the first clouds and mountains seem the last
But those attain'd we tremble to survey
The growing labours of the lengthen'd way 
Th' increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes
Hills peep o'er hills and Alps on Alps arise
A perfect Judge will read each work of Wit
With the same spirit that its author writ
Survey the WHOLE nor seek slight faults to find 
Where nature moves and rapture warms the mind
Nor lose for that malignant dull delight
The gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with Wit
But in such lays as neither ebb nor flow
Correctly cold and regularly low 
That shunning faults one quiet tenour keep
We cannot blame indeed but we may sleep
In wit as nature what affects our hearts
Is not th' exactness of peculiar parts
'Tis not a lip or eye we beauty call 
But the joint force and full result of all
Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome
The world just wonder and ev'n thine O Rome
No single parts unequally surprize
All comes united to th' admiring eyes 
No monstrous height or breadth or length appear
The Whole at once is bold and regular
Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see
Thinks what ne'er was nor is nor e'er shall be
In every work regard the writer End 
Since none can compass more than they intend
And if the means be just the conduct true
Applause in spight of trivial faults is due
As men of breeding sometimes men of wit
T' avoid great errors must the less commit 
Neglect the rules each verbal Critic lays
For not to know some trifles is a praise
Most Critics fond of some subservient art
Still make the Whole depend upon a Part
They talk of principles but notions prize 
And all to one lov'd Folly sacrifice
Once on a time La Mancha Knight they say
A certain bard encount'ring on the way
Discours'd in terms as just with looks as sage
As e'er could Dennis of the Grecian stage 
Concluding all were desp'rate sots and fools
Who durst depart from Aristotle rules
Our Author happy in a judge so nice
Produc'd his Play and begg'd the Knight advice
Made him observe the subject and the plot 
The manners passions unities what not
All which exact to rule were brought about
Were but a Combat in the lists left out
What leave the Combat out exclaims the Knight
Yes or we must renounce the Stagirite 
Not so by Heav'n he answers in a rage
Knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage
So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain
Then build a new or act it in a plain
Thus Critics of less judgment than caprice 
Curious not knowing not exact but nice
Form short Ideas and offend in arts
As most in manners by a love to parts
Some to Conceit alone their taste confine
And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line 
Pleas'd with a work where nothing just or fit
One glaring Chaos and wild heap of wit
Poets like painters thus unskill'd to trace
The naked nature and the living grace
With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part 
And hide with ornaments their want of art
True Wit is Nature to advantage dress'd
What oft was thought but ne'er so well express'd
Something whose truth convinc'd at sight we find
That gives us back the image of our mind 
As shades more sweetly recommend the light
So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit
For works may have more wit than does 'em good
As bodies perish thro' excess of blood
Others for Language all their care express 
And value books as women men for Dress
Their praise is still the Style is excellent
The Sense they humbly take upon content
Words are like leaves and where they most abound
Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found 
False Eloquence like the prismatic glass
Its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place
The face of Nature we no more survey
All glares alike without distinction gay
But true expression like th' unchanging Sun 
Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon
It gilds all objects but it alters none
Expression is the dress of thought and still
Appears more decent as more suitable
A vile conceit in pompous words express'd 
Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd
For diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort
As several garbs with country town and court
Some by old words to fame have made pretence
Ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense 
Such labour'd nothings in so strange a style
Amaze th' unlearn'd and make the learned smile
Unlucky as Fungoso in the play 
These sparks with awkward vanity display 
What the fine gentleman wore yesterday 
And but so mimic ancient wits at best
As apes our grandsires in their doublets drest
In words as fashions the same rule will hold
Alike fantastic if too new or old
Be not the first by whom the new are try'd 
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside
But most by Numbers judge a Poet song
And smooth or rough with them is right or wrong
In the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire
Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire 
Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear 
Not mend their minds as some to Church repair 
Not for the doctrine but the music there 
These equal syllables alone require
Tho' oft the ear the open vowe tire 
While expletives their feeble aid do join
And ten low words oft creep in one dull line
While they ring round the same unvary'd chimes
With sure returns of still expected rhymes
Where-e'er you find the cooling western breeze 
In the next line it whispers through the trees
If crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep
The reader threaten'd not in vain with sleep
Then at the last and only couplet fraught
With some unmeaning thing they call a thought 
A needless Alexandrine ends the song
That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along
Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know
What roundly smooth or languishingly slow
And praise the easy vigour of a line 
Where Denham strength and Waller sweetness join
True ease in writing comes from art not chance
As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance
'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence
The sound must seem an Echo to the sense 
Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows
And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows
But when loud surges lash the sounding shore
The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar
When Ajax strives some rock vast weight to throw 
The line too labours and the words move slow
Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain
Flies o'er th' unbending corn and skims along the main
Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprize
And bid alternate passions fall and rise 
While at each change the son of Libyan Jove
Now burns with glory and then melts with love
Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow
Now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow
Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found 
And the world victor stood subdu'd by Sound
The pow'r of Music all our hearts allow
And what Timotheus was is DRYDEN now
Avoid Extremes and shun the fault of such
Who still are pleas'd too little or too much 
At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence
That always shows great pride or little sense
Those heads as stomachs are not sure the best
Which nauseate all and nothing can digest
Yet let not each gay Turn thy rapture move 
For fools admire but men of sense approve
As things seem large which we thro' mists descry
Dulness is ever apt to magnify
Some foreign writers some our own despise
The Ancients only or the Moderns prize 
Thus Wit like Faith by each man is apply'd
To one small sect and all are damn'd beside
Meanly they seek the blessing to confine
And force that sun but on a part to shine
Which not alone the southern wit sublimes 
But ripens spirits in cold northern climes
Which from the first has shone on ages past
Enlights the present and shall warm the last
Tho' each may feel increases and decays
And see now clearer and now darker days 
Regard not then if Wit be old or new
But blame the false and value still the true
Some ne'er advance a Judgment of their own
But catch the spreading notion of the Town
They reason and conclude by precedent 
And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent
Some judge of author names not works and then
Nor praise nor blame the writings but the men
Of all this servile herd the worst is he
That in proud dulness joins with Quality 
A constant Critic at the great man board
To fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord
What woful stuff this madrigal would be
In some starv'd hackney sonneteer or me
But let a Lord once own the happy lines 
How the wit brightens how the style refines
Before his sacred name flies ev'ry fault
And each exalted stanza teems with thought
The Vulgar thus through Imitation err
As oft the Learn'd by being singular 
So much they scorn the crowd that if the throng
By chance go right they purposely go wrong
So Schismatics the plain believers quit
And are but damn'd for having too much wit
Some praise at morning what they blame at night 
But always think the last opinion right
A Muse by these is like a mistress us'd
This hour she idoliz'd the next abus'd
While their weak heads like towns unfortify'd
'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side 
Ask them the cause they're wiser still they say
And still to-morrow wiser than to-day
We think our fathers fools so wise we grow
Our wiser sons no doubt will think us so
Once School-divines this zealous isle o'er-spread 
Who knew most Sentences was deepest read
Faith Gospel all seem'd made to be disputed
And none had sense enough to be confuted
Scotists and Thomists now in peace remain
Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck-lane 
If Faith itself has diff'rent dresses worn
What wonder modes in Wit should take their turn
Oft' leaving what is natural and fit
The current folly proves the ready wit
And authors think their reputation safe 
Which lives as long as fools are pleas'd to laugh
Some valuing those of their own side or mind
Still make themselves the measure of mankind
Fondly we think we honour merit then
When we but praise ourselves in other men 
Parties in Wit attend on those of State
And public faction doubles private hate
Pride Malice Folly against Dryden rose
In various shapes of Parsons Critics Beaus
But sense surviv'd when merry jests were past 
For rising merit will buoy up at last
Might he return and bless once more our eyes
New Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise
Nay should great Homer lift his awful head
Zoilus again would start up from the dead 
Envy will merit as its shade pursue
But like a shadow proves the substance true
For envy'd Wit like Sol eclips'd makes known
Th' opposing body grossness not its own
When first that sun too pow'rful beams displays 
It draws up vapours which obscure its rays
But ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way
Reflect new glories and augment the day
Be thou the first true merit to befriend
His praise is lost who stays till all commend 
Short is the date alas of modern rhymes
And 'tis but just to let them live betimes
No longer now that golden age appears
When Patriarch-wits surviv'd a thousand years
Now length of Fame our second life is lost 
And bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast
Our sons their fathers' failing language see
And such as Chaucer is shall Dryden be
So when the faithful pencil has design'd
Some bright Idea of the master mind 
Where a new world leaps out at his command
And ready Nature waits upon his hand
When the ripe colours soften and unite
And sweetly melt into just shade and light
When mellowing years their full perfection give 
And each bold figure just begins to live
The treach'rous colours the fair art betray
And all the bright creation fades away
Unhappy Wit like most mistaken things
Atones not for that envy which it brings 
In youth alone its empty praise we boast
But soon the short-liv'd vanity is lost
Like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies
That gaily blooms but ev'n in blooming dies
What is this Wit which must our cares employ 
The owner wife that other men enjoy
Then most our trouble still when most admir'd
And still the more we give the more requir'd
Whose fame with pains we guard but lose with ease
Sure some to vex but never all to please 
'Tis what the vicious fear the virtuous shun
By fools't is hated and by knaves undone
If Wit so much from Ign'rance undergo
Ah let not Learning too commence its foe
Of old those met rewards who could excel 
And such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well
Tho' triumphs were to gen'rals only due
Crowns were reserv'd to grace the soldiers too
Now they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown
Employ their pains to spurn some others down 
And while self-love each jealous writer rules
Contending wits become the sport of fools
But still the worst with most regret commend
For each ill Author is as bad a Friend
To what base ends and by what abject ways 
Are mortals urg'd thro' sacred lust of praise
Ah ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast
Nor in the Critic let the Man be lost
Good-nature and good-sense must ever join
To err is human to forgive divine 
But if in noble minds some dregs remain
Not yet purg'd off of spleen and sour disdain
Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes
Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times
No pardon vile Obscenity should find 
Tho' wit and art conspire to move your mind
But Dulness with Obscenity must prove
As shameful sure as Impotence in love
In the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease
Sprung the rank weed and thriv'd with large increase 
When love was all an easy Monarch care
Seldom at council never in a war
Jilts rul'd the state and statesmen farces writ
Nay wits had pensions and young Lords had wit
The Fair sate panting at a Courtier play 
And not a Mask went unimprov'd away
The modest fan was lifted up no more
And Virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before
The following licence of a Foreign reign
Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain 
Then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation
And taught more pleasant methods of salvation
Where Heav'n free subjects might their rights dispute
Lest God himself should seem too absolute
Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare 
And Vice admir'd to find a flatt'rer there
Encourag'd thus Wit Titans brav'd the skies
And the press groan'd with licens'd blasphemies
These monsters Critics with your darts engage
Here point your thunder and exhaust your rage 
Yet shun their fault who scandalously nice
Will needs mistake an author into vice
All seems infected that th' infected spy
As all looks yellow to the jaundic'd eye
Learn then what MORALS Critics ought to show 
For't is but half a Judge task to know
'Tis not enough taste judgment learning join
In all you speak let truth and candour shine
That not alone what to your sense is due
All may allow but seek your friendship too 
Be silent always when you doubt your sense
And speak tho' sure with seeming diffidence
Some positive persisting fops we know
Who if once wrong will needs be always so
But you with pleasure own your errors past 
And make each day a Critic on the last
'T is not enough your counsel still be true
Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do
Men must be taught as if you taught them not
And things unknown propos'd as things forgot 
Without Good Breeding truth is disapprov'd
That only makes superior sense belov'd
Be niggards of advice on no pretence
For the worst avarice is that of sense
With mean complacence ne'er betray your trust 
Nor be so civil as to prove unjust
Fear not the anger of the wise to raise
Those best can bear reproof who merit praise
'T were well might critics still this freedom take
But Appius reddens at each word you speak 
And stares tremendous with a threat'ning eye
Like some fierce Tyrant in old tapestry
Fear most to tax an Honourable fool
Whose right it is uncensur'd to be dull
Such without wit are Poets when they please 
As without learning they can take Degrees
Leave dang'rous truths to unsuccessful Satires
And flattery to fulsome Dedicators
Whom when they praise the world believes no more
Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er 
'T is best sometimes your censure to restrain
And charitably let the dull be vain
Your silence there is better than your spite
For who can rail so long as they can write
Still humming on their drowsy course they keep 
And lash'd so long like tops are lash'd asleep
False steps but help them to renew the race
As after stumbling Jades will mend their pace
What crowds of these impenitently bold
In sounds and jingling syllables grown old 
Still run on Poets in a raging vein
Ev'n to the dregs and squeezings of the brain
Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense
And rhyme with all the rage of Impotence
Such shameless Bards we have and yet't is true 
There are as mad abandon'd Critics too
The bookful blockhead ignorantly read
With loads of learned lumber in his head
With his own tongue still edifies his ears
And always list'ning to himself appears 
All books he reads and all he reads assails
From Dryden Fables down to Durfey Tales
With him most authors steal their works or buy
Garth did not write his own Dispensary
Name a new Play and he the Poet friend 
Nay show'd his faults but when would Poets mend
No place so sacred from such fops is barr'd
Nor is Paul church more safe than Paul churchyard
Nay fly to Altars there they'll talk you dead
For Fools rush in where Angels fear to tread 
Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks 
It still looks home and short excursions makes 
But rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks 
And never shock'd and never turn'd aside
Bursts out resistless with a thund'ring tide 
But where the man who counsel can bestow
Still pleas'd to teach and yet not proud to know
Unbiass'd or by favour or by spite
Not dully prepossess'd nor blindly right
Tho' learn'd well-bred and tho' well-bred sincere 
Modestly bold and humanly severe
Who to a friend his faults can freely show
And gladly praise the merit of a foe
Blest with a taste exact yet unconfin'd
A knowledge both of books and human kind 
Gen'rous converse a soul exempt from pride
And love to praise with reason on his side
Such once were Critics such the happy few
Athens and Rome in better ages knew
The mighty Stagirite first left the shore 
Spread all his sails and durst the deeps explore
He steer'd securely and discover'd far
Led by the light of the Maeonian Star
Poets a race long unconfin'd and free
Still fond and proud of savage liberty 
Receiv'd his laws and stood convinc'd 't was fit
Who conquer'd Nature should preside o'er Wit
Horace still charms with graceful negligence
And without method talks us into sense
Will like a friend familiarly convey 
The truest notions in the easiest way
He who supreme in judgment as in wit
Might boldly censure as he boldly writ
Yet judg'd with coolness tho' he sung with fire
His Precepts teach but what his works inspire 
Our Critics take a contrary extreme
They judge with fury but they write with fle'me
Nor suffers Horace more in wrong Translations
By Wits than Critics in as wrong Quotations
See Dionysius Homer thoughts refine 
And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line
Fancy and art in gay Petronius please
The scholar learning with the courtier ease
In grave Quintilian copious work we find
The justest rules and clearest method join'd 
Thus useful arms in magazines we place
All rang'd in order and dispos'd with grace
But less to please the eye than arm the hand
Still fit for use and ready at command
Thee bold Longinus all the Nine inspire 
And bless their Critic with a Poet fire
An ardent Judge who zealous in his trust
With warmth gives sentence yet is always just
Whose own example strengthens all his laws
And is himself that great Sublime he draws 
Thus long succeeding Critics justly reign'd
Licence repress'd and useful laws ordain'd
Learning and Rome alike in empire grew
And Arts still follow'd where her Eagles flew
From the same foes at last both felt their doom 
And the same age saw Learning fall and Rome
With Tyranny then Superstition join'd
As that the body this enslav'd the mind
Much was believ'd but little understood
And to be dull was constru'd to be good 
A second deluge Learning thus o'er-run
And the Monks finish'd what the Goths begun
At length Erasmus that great injur'd name
The glory of the Priesthood and the shame
Stemm'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age 
And drove those holy Vandals off the stage
But see each Muse in LEO'S golden days
Starts from her trance and trims her wither'd bays
Rome ancient Genius o'er its ruins spread
Shakes off the dust and rears his rev'rend head 
Then Sculpture and her sister-arts revive
Stones leap'd to form and rocks began to live
With sweeter notes each rising Temple rung
A Raphael painted and a Vida sung
Immortal Vida on whose honour'd brow 
The Poet bays and Critic ivy grow
Cremona now shal ever boast thy name
As next in place to Mantua next in fame
But soon by impious arms from Latium chas'd
Their ancient bounds the banish'd Muses pass'd 
Thence Arts o'er all the northern world advance
But Critic-learning flourish'd most in France
The rules a nation born to serve obeys
And Boileau still in right of Horace sways
But we brave Britons foreign laws despis'd 
And kept unconquer'd and unciviliz'd
Fierce for the liberties of wit and bold
We still defy'd the Romans as of old
Yet some there were among the sounder few
Of those who less presum'd and better knew 
Who durst assert the juster ancient cause
And here restor'd Wit fundamental laws
Such was the Muse whose rules and practice tell
Nature chief Master-piece is writing well
Such was Roscommon not more learn'd than good 
With manners gen'rous as his noble blood
To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known
And ev'ry author merit but his own
Such late was Walsh the Muse judge and friend
Who justly knew to blame or to commend 
To failings mild but zealous for desert
The clearest head and the sincerest heart
This humble praise lamented shade receive
This praise at least a grateful Muse may give
The Muse whose early voice you taught to sing 
Prescrib'd her heights and prun'd her tender wing
Her guide now lost no more attempts to rise
But in low numbers short excursions tries
Content if hence th' unlearn'd their wants may view
The learn'd reflect on what before they knew 
Careless of censure nor too fond of fame
Still pleas'd to praise yet not afraid to blame
Averse alike to flatter or offend
Not free from faults nor yet too vain to mend
What dire offence from am'rous causes springs
What mighty contests rise from trivial things
I sing This verse to CARYL Muse is due
This ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view
Slight is the subject but not so the praise 
If She inspire and He approve my lays
Say what strange motive Goddess could compel
A well-bred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle
O say what stranger cause yet unexplor'd
Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord 
In tasks so bold can little men engage
And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage
Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray
And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day
Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake 
And sleepless lovers just at twelve awake
Thrice rung the bell the slipper knock'd the ground
And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound
Belinda still her downy pillow prest
Her guardian SYLPH prolong'd the balmy rest 
'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed
The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head
A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau
That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow
Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay 
And thus in whispers said or seem'd to say
Fairest of mortals thou distinguish'd care
Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air
If e'er one vision touch'd thy infant thought
Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught 
Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen
The silver token and the circled green
Or virgins visited by Angel-pow'rs
With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs
Hear and believe thy own importance know 
Nor bound thy narrow views to things below
Some secret truths from learned pride conceal'd
To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd
What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give
The Fair and Innocent shall still believe 
Know then unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly
The light Militia of the lower sky
These tho' unseen are ever on the wing
Hang o'er the Box and hover round the Ring
Think what an equipage thou hast in Air 
And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair
As now your own our beings were of old
And once inclos'd in Woman beauteous mould
Thence by a soft transition we repair
From earthly Vehicles to these of air 
Think not when Woman transient breath is fled
That all her vanities at once are dead
Succeeding vanities she still regards
And tho' she plays no more o'erlooks the cards
Her joy in gilded Chariots when alive 
And love of Ombre after death survive
For when the Fair in all their pride expire
To their first Elements their Souls retire
The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame
Mount up and take a Salamander name 
Soft yielding minds to Water glide away
And sip with Nymphs their elemental Tea
The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome
In search of mischief still on Earth to roam
The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair 
And sport and flutter in the fields of Air
Know further yet whoever fair and chaste
Rejects mankind is by some Sylph embrac'd
For Spirits freed from mortal laws with ease
Assume what sexes and what shapes they please 
What guards the purity of melting Maids
In courtly balls and midnight masquerades
Safe from the treach'rous friend the daring spark
The glance by day the whisper in the dark
When kind occasion prompts their warm desires 
When music softens and when dancing fires
'Tis but their Sylph the wise Celestials know
Tho' Honour is the word with Men below
Some nymphs there are too conscious of their face
For life predestin'd to the Gnomes' embrace 
These swell their prospects and exalt their pride
When offers are disdain'd and love deny'd
Then gay Ideas crowd the vacant brain
While Peers and Dukes and all their sweeping train
And Garters Stars and Coronets appear 
And in soft sounds Your Grace salutes their ear
'T is these that early taint the female soul
Instruct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll
Teach Infant-cheeks a bidden blush to know
And little hearts to flutter at a Beau 
Oft when the world imagine women stray
The Sylphs thro' mystic mazes guide their way
Thro' all the giddy circle they pursue
And old impertinence expel by new
What tender maid but must a victim fall 
To one man treat but for another ball
When Florio speaks what virgin could withstand
If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand
With varying vanities from ev'ry part
They shift the moving Toyshop of their heart 
Where wigs with wigs with sword-knots sword-knots strive
Beaux banish beaux and coaches coaches drive
This erring mortals Levity may call
Oh blind to truth the Sylphs contrive it all
Of these am I who thy protection claim 
A watchful sprite and Ariel is my name
Late as I rang'd the crystal wilds of air
In the clear Mirror of thy ruling Star
I saw alas some dread event impend
Ere to the main this morning sun descend 
But heav'n reveals not what or how or where
Warn'd by the Sylph oh pious maid beware
This to disclose is all thy guardian can
Beware of all but most beware of Man
He said when Shock who thought she slept too long 
Leap'd up and wak'd his mistress with his tongue
'T was then Belinda if report say true
Thy eyes first open'd on a Billet-doux
Wounds Charms and Ardors were no sooner read
But all the Vision vanish'd from thy head 
And now unveil'd the Toilet stands display'd
Each silver Vase in mystic order laid
First rob'd in white the Nymph intent adores
With head uncover'd the Cosmetic pow'rs
A heav'nly image in the glass appears 
To that she bends to that her eyes she rears
Th' inferior Priestess at her altar side
Trembling begins the sacred rites of Pride
Unnumber'd treasures ope at once and here
The various off'rings of the world appear 
From each she nicely culls with curious toil
And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring spoil
This casket India glowing gems unlocks
And all Arabia breathes from yonder box
The Tortoise here and Elephant unite 
Transformed to combs the speckled and the white
Here files of pins extend their shining rows
Puffs Powders Patches Bibles Billet-doux
Now awful Beauty puts on all its arms
The fair each moment rises in her charms 
Repairs her smiles awakens ev'ry grace
And calls forth all the wonders of her face
Sees by degrees a purer blush arise
And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes
The busy Sylphs surround their darling care 
These set the head and those divide the hair
Some fold the sleeve whilst others plait the gown
And Betty prais'd for labours not her own
Not with more glories in th' etherial plain
The Sun first rises o'er the purpled main
Than issuing forth the rival of his beams
Launch'd on the bosom of the silver Thames
Fair Nymphs and well-drest Youths around her shone 
But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone
On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore
Which Jews might kiss and Infidels adore
Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose
Quick as her eyes and as unfix'd as those 
Favours to none to all she smiles extends
Oft she rejects but never once offends
Bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike
And like the sun they shine on all alike
Yet graceful ease and sweetness void of pride 
Might hide her faults if Belles had faults to hide
If to her share some female errors fall
Look on her face and you'll forget 'em all
This Nymph to the destruction of mankind
Nourish'd two Locks which graceful hung behind 
In equal curls and well conspir'd to deck
With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck
Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains
And mighty hearts are held in slender chains
With hairy springes we the birds betray 
Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey
Fair tresses man imperial race ensnare
And beauty draws us with a single hair
Th' advent'rous Baron the bright locks admir'd
He saw he wish'd and to the prize aspir'd 
Resolv'd to win he meditates the way
By force to ravish or by fraud betray
For when success a Lover toil attends
Few ask if fraud or force attain'd his ends
For this ere Phoebus rose he had implor'd 
Propitious heav'n and ev'ry pow'r ador'd
But chiefly Love to Love an Altar built
Of twelve vast French Romances neatly gilt
There lay three garters half a pair of gloves
And all the trophies of his former loves 
With tender Billet-doux he lights the pyre
And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire
Then prostrate falls and begs with ardent eyes
Soon to obtain and long possess the prize
The pow'rs gave ear and granted half his pray'r 
The rest the winds dispers'd in empty air
But now secure the painted vessel glides
The sun-beams trembling on the floating tides
While melting music steals upon the sky
And soften'd sounds along the waters die 
Smooth flow the waves the Zephyrs gently play
Belinda smil'd and all the world was gay
All but the Sylph with careful thoughts opprest
Th' impending woe sat heavy on his breast
He summons strait his Denizens of air 
The lucid squadrons round the sails repair
Soft o'er the shrouds aerial whispers breathe
That seem'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath
Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold
Waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold 
Transparent forms too fine for mortal sight
Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light
Loose to the wind their airy garments flew
Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew
Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies 
Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes
While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings
Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings
Amid the circle on the gilded mast
Superior by the head was Ariel plac'd 
His purple pinions op'ning to the sun
He rais'd his azure wand and thus begun
Ye Sylphs and Sylphids to your chief give ear
Fays Fairies Genii Elves and Daemons hear
Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd 
By laws eternal to th' aerial kind
Some in the fields of purest AEther play
And bask and whiten in the blaze of day
Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high
Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky 
Some less refin'd beneath the moon pale light
Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night
Or suck the mists in grosser air below
Or dip their pinions in the painted bow
Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main 
Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain
Others on earth o'er human race preside
Watch all their ways and all their actions guide
Of these the chief the care of Nations own
And guard with Arms divine the British Throne 
Our humbler province is to tend the Fair
Not a less pleasing tho' less glorious care
To save the powder from too rude a gale
Nor let th' imprison'd-essences exhale
To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs 
To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs
A brighter wash to curl their waving hairs
Assist their blushes and inspire their airs
Nay oft in dreams invention we bestow
To change a Flounce or add a Furbelow 
This day black Omens threat the brightest Fair
That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit care
Some dire disaster or by force or slight
But what or where the fates have wrapt in night
Whether the nymph shall break Diana law 
Or some frail China jar receive a flaw
Or stain her honour or her new brocade
Forget her pray'rs or miss a masquerade
Or lose her heart or necklace at a ball
Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall 
Haste then ye spirits to your charge repair
The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta care
The drops to thee Brillante we consign
And Momentilla let the watch be thine
Do thou Crispissa tend her fav'rite Lock 
Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock
To fifty chosen Sylphs of special note
We trust th' important charge the Petticoat
Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail
Tho' stiff with hoops and arm'd with ribs of whale 
Form a strong line about the silver bound
And guard the wide circumference around
Whatever spirit careless of his charge
His post neglects or leaves the fair at large
Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins 
Be stopp'd in vials or transfix'd with pins
Or plung'd in lakes of bitter washes lie
Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin eye
Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain
While clogg'd he beats his silken wings in vain 
Or Alum styptics with contracting pow'r
Shrink his thin essence like a rivel'd flow'r
Or as Ixion fix'd the wretch shall feel
The giddy motion of the whirling Mill
In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow 
And tremble at the sea that froths below
He spoke the spirits from the sails descend
Some orb in orb around the nymph extend
Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair
Some hang upon the pendants of her ear 
With beating hearts the dire event they wait
Anxious and trembling for the birth of Fate
Close by those meads for ever crown'd with flow'rs
Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs
There stands a structure of majestic frame
Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name
Here Britain statesmen oft the fall foredoom 
Of foreign Tyrants and of Nymphs at home
Here thou great ANNA whom three realms obey
Dost sometimes counsel take and sometimes Tea
Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort
To taste awhile the pleasures of a Court 
In various talk th' instructive hours they past
Who gave the ball or paid the visit last
One speaks the glory of the British Queen
And one describes a charming Indian screen
A third interprets motions looks and eyes 
At ev'ry word a reputation dies
Snuff or the fan supply each pause of chat
With singing laughing ogling and all that
Mean while declining from the noon of day
The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray 
The hungry Judges soon the sentence sign
And wretches hang that jury-men may dine
The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace
And the long labours of the Toilet cease
Belinda now whom thirst of fame invites 
Burns to encounter two advent'rous Knights
At Ombre singly to decide their doom
And swells her breast with conquests yet to come
Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join
Each band the number of the sacred nine 
Soon as she spreads her hand th' aerial guard
Descend and sit on each important card
First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore
Then each according to the rank they bore
For Sylphs yet mindful of their ancient race 
Are as when women wondrous fond of place
Behold four Kings in majesty rever'd
With hoary whiskers and a forky beard
And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r
Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r 
Four Knaves in garbs succinct a trusty band
Caps on their heads and halberts in their hand
And particolour'd troops a shining train
Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain
The skilful Nymph reviews her force with care 
Let Spades be trumps she said and trumps they were
Now move to war her sable Matadores
In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors
Spadillio first unconquerable Lord
Led off two captive trumps and swept the board 
As many more Manillio forc'd to yield
And march'd a victor from the verdant field
Him Basto follow'd but his fate more hard
Gain'd but one trump and one Plebeian card
With his broad sabre next a chief in years 
The hoary Majesty of Spades appears
Puts forth one manly leg to sight reveal'd
The rest his many-colour'd robe conceal'd
The rebel Knave who dares his prince engage
Proves the just victim of his royal rage 
Ev'n mighty Pam that Kings and Queens o'erthrew
And mow'd down armies in the fights of Lu
Sad chance of war now destitute of aid
Falls undistinguish'd by the victor spade
Thus far both armies to Belinda yield 
Now to the Baron fate inclines the field
His warlike Amazon her host invades
Th' imperial consort of the crown of Spades
The Club black Tyrant first her victim dy'd
Spite of his haughty mien and barb'rous pride 
What boots the regal circle on his head
His giant limbs in state unwieldy spread
That long behind he trails his pompous robe
And of all monarchs only grasps the globe
The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace 
Th' embroider'd King who shows but half his face
And his refulgent Queen with pow'rs combin'd
Of broken troops an easy conquest find
Clubs Diamonds Hearts in wild disorder seen
With throngs promiscuous strow the level green 
Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs
Of Asia troops and Afric sable sons
With like confusion different nations fly
Of various habit and of various dye
The pierc'd battalions dis-united fall 
In heaps on heaps one fate o'erwhelms them all
The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts
And wins oh shameful chance the Queen of Hearts
At this the blood the virgin cheek forsook
A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look 
She sees and trembles at th' approaching ill
Just in the jaws of ruin and Codille
And now as oft in some distemper'd State
On one nice Trick depends the gen'ral fate
An Ace of Hearts steps forth The King unseen 
Lurk'd in her hand and mourn'd his captive Queen
He springs to Vengeance with an eager pace
And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace
The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky
The walls the woods and long canals reply 
Oh thoughtless mortals ever blind to fate
Too soon dejected and too soon elate
Sudden these honours shall be snatch'd away
And curs'd for ever this victorious day
For lo the board with cups and spoons is crown'd 
The berries crackle and the mill turns round
On shining Altars of Japan they raise
The silver lamp the fiery spirits blaze
From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide
While China earth receives the smoking tide 
At once they gratify their scent and taste
And frequent cups prolong the rich repast
Straight hover round the Fair her airy band
Some as she sipp'd the fuming liquor fann'd
Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd 
Trembling and conscious of the rich brocade
Coffee which makes the politician wise
And see thro' all things with his half-shut eyes
Sent up in vapours to the Baron brain
New Stratagems the radiant Lock to gain 
Ah cease rash youth desist ere't is too late
Fear the just Gods and think of Scylla Fate
Chang'd to a bird and sent to flit in air
She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair
But when to mischief mortals bend their will 
How soon they find fit instruments of ill
Just then Clarissa drew with tempting grace
A two-edg'd weapon from her shining case
So Ladies in Romance assist their Knight
Present the spear and arm him for the fight 
He takes the gift with rev'rence and extends
The little engine on his fingers' ends
This just behind Belinda neck he spread
As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head
Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprites repair 
A thousand wings by turns blow back the hair
And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear
Thrice she look'd back and thrice the foe drew near
Just in that instant anxious Ariel sought
The close recesses of the Virgin thought 
As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd
He watch'd th' Ideas rising in her mind
Sudden he view'd in spite of all her art
An earthly Lover lurking at her heart
Amaz'd confus'd he found his pow'r expir'd 
Resign'd to fate and with a sigh retir'd
The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring Forfex wide
T' inclose the Lock now joins it to divide
Ev'n then before the fatal engine clos'd
A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd 
Fate urg'd the shears and cut the Sylph in twain
But airy substance soon unites again
The meeting points the sacred hair dissever
From the fair head for ever and for ever
Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes 
And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies
Not louder shrieks to pitying heav'n are cast
When husbands or when lapdogs breathe their last
Or when rich China vessels fall'n from high
In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie 
Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine
The victor cry'd the glorious Prize is mine
While fish in streams or birds delight in air
Or in a coach and six the British Fair
As long as Atalantis shall be read 
Or the small pillow grace a Lady bed
While visits shall be paid on solemn days
When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze
While nymphs take treats or assignations give
So long my honour name and praise shall live 
What Time would spare from Steel receives its date
And monuments like men submit to fate
Steel could the labour of the Gods destroy
And strike to dust th' imperial tow'rs of Troy
Steel could the works of mortal pride confound 
And hew triumphal arches to the ground
What wonder then fair nymph thy hairs should feel
The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel
But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppress'd
And secret passions labour'd in her breast
Not youthful kings in battle seiz'd alive
Not scornful virgins who their charms survive
Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss 
Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss
Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die
Not Cynthia when her manteau pinn'd awry
E'er felt such rage resentment and despair
As thou sad Virgin for thy ravish'd Hair 
For that sad moment when the Sylphs withdrew
And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew
Umbriel a dusky melancholy sprite
As ever sully'd the fair face of light
Down to the central earth his proper scene 
Repair'd to search the gloomy Cave of Spleen
Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome
And in a vapour reach'd the dismal dome
No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows
The dreaded East is all the wind that blows 
Here in a grotto shelter'd close from air
And screen'd in shades from day detested glare
She sighs for ever on her pensive bed
Pain at her side and Megrim at her head
Two handmaids wait the throne alike in place 
But diff'ring far in figure and in face
Here stood Ill-nature like an ancient maid
Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd
With store of pray'rs for mornings nights and noons
Her hand is fill'd her bosom with lampoons 
There Affectation with a sickly mien
Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen
Practis'd to lisp and hang the head aside
Faints into airs and languishes with pride
On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe 
Wrapt in a gown for sickness and for show
The fair ones feel such maladies as these
When each new night-dress gives a new disease
A constant Vapour o'er the palace flies
Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise 
Dreadful as hermit dreams in haunted shades
Or bright as visions of expiring maids
Now glaring fiends and snakes on rolling spires
Pale spectres gaping tombs and purple fires
Now lakes of liquid gold Elysian scenes 
And crystal domes and angels in machines
Unnumber'd throngs on every side are seen
Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen
Here living Tea-pots stand one arm held out
One bent the handle this and that the spout 
A Pipkin there like Homer Tripod walks
Here sighs a Jar and there a Goose-pie talks
Men prove with child as pow'rful fancy works
And maids turn'd bottles call aloud for corks
Safe past the Gnome thro' this fantastic band 
A branch of healing Spleenwort in his hand
Then thus address'd the pow'r Hail wayward Queen
Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen
Parent of vapours and of female wit
Who give th' hysteric or poetic fit 
On various tempers act by various ways
Make some take physic others scribble plays
Who cause the proud their visits to delay
And send the godly in a pet to pray
A nymph there is that all thy pow'r disdains 
And thousands more in equal mirth maintains
But oh if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace
Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face
Like Citron-waters matrons cheeks inflame
Or change complexions at a losing game 
If e'er with airy horns I planted heads
Or rumpled petticoats or tumbled beds
Or caus'd suspicion when no soul was rude
Or discompos'd the head-dress of a Prude
Or e'er to costive lap-dog gave disease 
Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease
Hear me and touch Belinda with chagrin
That single act gives half the world the spleen
The Goddess with a discontented air
Seems to reject him tho' she grants his pray'r 
A wond'rous Bag with both her hands she binds
Like that where once Ulysses held the winds
There she collects the force of female lungs
Sighs sobs and passions and the war of tongues
A Vial next she fills with fainting fears 
Soft sorrows melting griefs and flowing tears
The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away
Spreads his black wings and slowly mounts to day
Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found
Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound 
Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent
And all the Furies issu'd at the vent
Belinda burns with more than mortal ire
And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire
O wretched maid she spread her hands and cry'd 
While Hampton echoes Wretched maid reply'd
Was it for this you took such constant care
The bodkin comb and essence to prepare
For this your locks in paper durance bound
For this with tort'ring irons wreath'd around 
For this with fillets strain'd your tender head
And bravely bore the double loads of lead
Gods shall the ravisher display your hair
While the Fops envy and the Ladies stare
Honour forbid at whose unrivall'd shrine 
Ease pleasure virtue all our sex resign
Methinks already I your tears survey
Already hear the horrid things they say
Already see you a degraded toast
And all your honour in a whisper lost 
How shall I then your helpless fame defend
'T will then be infamy to seem your friend
And shall this prize th' inestimable prize
Expos'd thro' crystal to the gazing eyes
And heighten'd by the diamond circling rays 
On that rapacious hand for ever blaze
Sooner shall grass in Hyde-park Circus grow
And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow
Sooner let earth air sea to Chaos fall
Men monkeys lap-dogs parrots perish all 
She said then raging to Sir Plume repairs
And bids her Beau demand the precious hairs
Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain
And the nice conduct of a clouded cane
With earnest eyes and round unthinking face 
He first the snuff-box open'd then the case
And thus broke out My Lord why what the devil
Z ds damn the lock 'fore Gad you must be civil
Plague on't't is past a jest nay prithee pox
Give her the hair he spoke and rapp'd his box 
It grieves me much reply'd the Peer again
Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain
But by this Lock this sacred Lock I swear
Which never more shall join its parted hair
Which never more its honours shall renew 
Clipp'd from the lovely head where late it grew
That while my nostrils draw the vital air
This hand which won it shall for ever wear
He spoke and speaking in proud triumph spread
The long-contended honours of her head 
But Umbriel hateful Gnome forbears not so
He breaks the Vial whence the sorrows flow
Then see the nymph in beauteous grief appears
Her eyes half-languishing half-drown'd in tears
On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head 
Which with a sigh she rais'd and thus she said
For ever curs'd be this detested day
Which snatch'd my best my fav'rite curl away
Happy ah ten times happy had I been
If Hampton-Court these eyes had never seen 
Yet am not I the first mistaken maid
By love of Courts to num'rous ills betray'd
Oh had I rather un-admir'd remain'd
In some lone isle or distant Northern land
Where the gilt Chariot never marks the way 
Where none learn Ombre none e'er taste Bohea
There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye
Like roses that in deserts bloom and die
What mov'd my mind with youthful Lords to roam
Oh had I stay'd and said my pray'rs at home 
'T was this the morning omens seem'd to tell
Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell
The tott'ring China shook without a wind
Nay Poll sat mute and Shock was most unkind
A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of fate 
In mystic visions now believ'd too late
See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs
My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares
These in two sable ringlets taught to break
Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck 
The sister-lock now sits uncouth alone
And in its fellow fate foresees its own
Uncurl'd it hangs the fatal shears demands
And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands
Oh hadst thou cruel been content to seize 
Hairs less in sight or any hairs but these
She said the pitying audience melt in tears
But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron ears
In vain Thalestris with reproach assails
For who can move when fair Belinda fails
Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain 
While Anna begg'd and Dido rag'd in vain
Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her fan
Silence ensu'd and thus the nymph began
Say why are Beauties prais'd and honour'd most
The wise man passion and the vain man toast 
Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford
Why Angels call'd and Angel-like ador'd
Why round our coaches crowd the white-glov'd Beaux
Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows
How vain are all these glories all our pains 
Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains
That men may say when we the front-box grace
'Behold the first in virtue as in face
Oh if to dance all night and dress all day
Charm'd the small-pox or chas'd old-age away 
Who would not scorn what housewife cares produce
Or who would learn one earthly thing of use
To patch nay ogle might become a Saint
Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint
But since alas frail beauty must decay 
Curl'd or uncurl'd since Locks will turn to grey
Since painted or not painted all shall fade
And she who scorns a man must die a maid
What then remains but well our pow'r to use
And keep good-humour still whate'er we lose 
And trust me dear good-humour can prevail
When airs and flights and screams and scolding fail
Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll
Charms strike the sight but merit wins the soul
So spoke the Dame but no applause ensu'd 
Belinda frown'd Thalestris call'd her Prude
To arms to arms the fierce Virago cries
And swift as lightning to the combat flies
All side in parties and begin th' attack
Fans clap silks rustle and tough whalebones crack 
Heroes' and Heroines' shouts confus'dly rise
And bass and treble voices strike the skies
No common weapons in their hands are found
Like Gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound
So when bold Homer makes the Gods engage 
And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage
'Gainst Pallas Mars Latona Hermes arms
And all Olympus rings with loud alarms
Jove thunder roars heav'n trembles all around
Blue Neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound 
Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs the ground gives way
And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day
Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce height
Clapp'd his glad wings and sate to view the fight
Propp'd on the bodkin spears the Sprites survey 
The growing combat or assist the fray
While thro' the press enrag'd Thalestris flies
And scatters death around from both her eyes
A Beau and Witling perish'd in the throng
One died in metaphor and one in song 
O cruel nymph a living death I bear
Cry'd Dapperwit and sunk beside his chair
A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast
Those eyes are made so killing was his last
Thus on Maeander flow'ry margin lies 
Th' expiring Swan and as he sings he dies
When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down
Chloe stepp'd in and kill'd him with a frown
She smil'd to see the doughty hero slain
But at her smile the Beau reviv'd again 
Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air
Weighs the Men wits against the Lady hair
The doubtful beam long nods from side to side
At length the wits mount up the hairs subside
See fierce Belinda on the Baron flies 
With more than usual lightning in her eyes
Nor fear'd the Chief th' unequal fight to try
Who sought no more than on his foe to die
But this bold Lord with manly strength endu'd
She with one finger and a thumb subdu'd 
Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew
A charge of Snuff the wily virgin threw
The Gnomes direct to ev'ry atom just
The pungent grains of titillating dust
Sudden with starting tears each eye o'erflows 
And the high dome re-echoes to his nose
Now meet thy fate incens'd Belinda cry'd
And drew a deadly bodkin from her side
The same his ancient personage to deck
Her great great grandsire wore about his neck 
In three seal-rings which after melted down
Form'd a vast buckle for his widow gown
Her infant grandame whistle next it grew
The bells she jingled and the whistle blew
Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother hairs 
Which long she wore and now Belinda wears
Boast not my fall he cry'd insulting foe
Thou by some other shalt be laid as low
Nor think to die dejects my lofty mind
All that I dread is leaving you behind 
Rather than so ah let me still survive
And burn in Cupid flames but burn alive
Restore the Lock she cries and all around
Restore the Lock the vaulted roofs rebound
Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain 
Roar'd for the handkerchief that caus'd his pain
But see how oft ambitious aims are cross'd
And chiefs contend 'till all the prize is lost
The Lock obtain'd with guilt and kept with pain
In ev'ry place is sought but sought in vain 
With such a prize no mortal must be blest
So heav'n decrees with heav'n who can contest
Some thought it mounted to the Lunar sphere
Since all things lost on earth are treasur'd there
There Hero wits are kept in pond'rous vases 
And beau in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases
There broken vows and death-bed alms are found
And lovers' hearts with ends of riband bound
The courtier promises and sick man pray'rs
The smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs 
Cages for gnats and chains to yoke a flea
Dry'd butterflies and tomes of casuistry
But trust the Muse she saw it upward rise
Tho' mark'd by none but quick poetic eyes
So Rome great founder to the heav'ns withdrew 
To Proculus alone confess'd in view
A sudden Star it shot thro' liquid air
And drew behind a radiant trail of hair
Not Berenice Locks first rose so bright
The heav'ns bespangling with dishevell'd light 
The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies
And pleas'd pursue its progress thro' the skies
This the Beau monde shall from the Mall survey
And hail with music its propitious ray
This the blest Lover shall for Venus take 
And send up vows from Rosamonda lake
This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies
When next he looks thro' Galileo eyes
And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom
The fate of Louis and the fall of Rome 
Then cease bright Nymph to mourn thy ravish'd hair
Which adds new glory to the shining sphere
Not all the tresses that fair head can boast
Shall draw such envy as the Lock you lost
For after all the murders of your eye 
When after millions slain yourself shall die
When those fair suns shall set as set they must
And all those tresses shall be laid in dust
This Lock the Muse shall consecrate to fame
And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda name
