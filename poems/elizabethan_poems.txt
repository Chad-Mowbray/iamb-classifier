Light I salute thee but with wounded nerves
Wishing the golden splendor pitchy darkness
What here THE ARRAIGNMENT ay this this is it
That our sunk eyes have waked for all this while
Here will be subject for my snakes and me
Cling to my neck and wrists my loving worms
And cast you round in soft and amorous folds
Till I do bid uncurl then breakyour knots
Shoot out yourselves at length as your forced stings
Would hide themselves within his maliced sides
To whom I shall apply you Stay the shine
Of this assembly here offends my sight
I'll darken that first and outface their grace
Wonder not if I stare these fifteen weeks
So long as since the plot was but an embrion
Have I with burning lights mixt vigilant thoughts
In expectation of this hated play
To which at last I am arrived as Prologue
Nor would I you should look for other looks
Gesture or compliment from me than what
The infected bulk of Envy can afford
For I am risse here with a covetous hope
To blast your pleasures and destroy your sports
With wrestings comments applications
Spy-like suggestions privy whisperings
And thousand such promoting sleights as these
Mark how I will begin The scene is ha
Rome Rome and Rome Crack eye-strings and your balls
Drop into earth let me be ever blind
I am prevented all my hopes are crost
Check'd and abated fie a freezing sweat
Flows forth at all my pores my entrails burn
What should I do Rome Rome O my vext soul
How might I force this to the present state
Are there no players hereno poet apes
That come with basilisk' s eyes whose forked tongues
Are steeped in venom as their hearts in gall
Either of these would help me they could wrest
Pervert and poison all they hear or see
With senseless glosses and allusions
Now if you be good devils fly me not
You know what dear and ample faculties
I have endowed you with I'll lend you more
Here take my snakes among you come and eat
And while the squeez'd juice flows in your black jaws
Help me to damn the author Spit it forth
Upon his lines and shew your rusty teeth
At every word or accent or else choose
Out of my longest vipers to stick down
In your deep throats and let the heads come forth
At your rank mouths that he may see you arm'd
With triple malice to hiss sting and tear
His work and him to forge and then declaim
Traduce corrupt apply inform suggest
O these are gifts wherein your souls are blest
What Do you hide yourselves will none appear
None answer what doth this calm troop affright you
Nay then I do despair down sink again
This travail is all lost with my dead hopes
If in such bosoms spite have left to dwell
Envy is not on earth nor scarce in hell
Stay monster ere thou sink-thus on thy head
Set we our bolder foot with which we tread
Thy malice into earth so Spite should die
Despised and scorn'd by noble industry
If any muse why I salute the stage
An armed Prologue know 'tis a dangerous age
Wherein who writes had need present his scenes
Forty-fold proof against the conjuring means
Of base detractors and illiterate apes
That fill up rooms in fair and formal shapes
'Gainst these have we put on this forced defence
Whereof the allegory and hid sense
Is that a well erected confidence
Can fright their pride and laugh their folly hence
Here now put case our author should once more
Swear that his play were good he doth implore
You would not argue him of arrogance
Howe'er that common spawn of ignorance
Our fry of writers may beslime his fame
And give his action that adulterate name
Such full-blown vanity he more doth loth
Than base dejection there a mean 'twixt both
Which with a constant firmness he pursues
As one that knows the strength of his own Muse
And this he hopes all free souls will allow
Others that take it with a rugged brow
Their moods he rather pities than envies
His mind it is above their injuries
Be not good ignorance I'm glad th'art gone
For thus alone our ear shall better judge
The hasty errors of our morning muse
Envy why twit'st thou me my time spent ill
And call'st my verse fruits of an idle quill
Or that unlike the line from whence I sprung
War dusty honours I pursue not young
Or that I study not the tedious laws
And prostitute my voice in every cause
Thy scope is mortal mine eternal fame
Which through the world shall ever chaunt my name
Homer will live whilst Tenedos stands and Ide
Or to the sea fleet Simois doth slide
And so shall Hesiod too while vines do bear
Or crooked sickles crop the ripen'd ear
Callimachus though in invention low
Shall still be sung since he in art doth flow
No loss shall come to Sophocles' proud vein
With sun and moon Aratus shall remain
While slaves be false fathers hard and bawds be whorish
Whilst harlots flatter shall Menander flourish
Ennius though rude and Accius high-rear'd strain
A fresh applause in every age shall gain
Of Varro name what ear shall not be told
Of Jason Argo and the fleece of gold
Then shall Lucretius' lofty numbers die
When earth and seas in fire and flame shall fry
Tityrus Tillage AEnee shall be read
Whilst Rome of all the conquered world is head
Till Cupid fires be out and his bow broken
Thy verses neat Tibullus shall be spoken
Our Gallus shall be known from east to west
So shall Lycoris whom he now loves best
The suffering plough-share or the flint may wear
But heavenly Poesy no death can fear
Kings shall give place to it and kingly shows
The banks o'er which gold-bearing Tagus flows
Kneel hinds to trash me let bright Phoebus swell
With cups full flowing from the Muses' well
Frost-fearing myrtle shall impale my head
And of sad lovers I be often read
Envy the living not the dead doth bite
For after death all men receive their right
Then when this body falls in funeral fire
My name shall live and my best part aspire
They wrong me sir and do abuse you more
That blow your ears with these untrue reports
I am not known unto the open stage
Nor do I traffic in their theatres
Indeed I do acknowledge at request
Of some near friends and honourable Romans
I have begun a poem of that nature
Sir let me crave you will forego these moods
I will be any thing or study any thing
I'll prove the unfashion'd body of the law
Pure elegance and make her rugged'st strains
Run smoothly as Propertius' elegies
And give me stomach to digest this law
That should have follow'd sure had I been he
O sacred Poesy thou spirit of arts
The soul of science and the queen of souls
What profane violence almost sacrilege
Hath here been offered thy divinities
That thine own guiltless poverty should arm
Prodigious ignorance to wound thee thus
For thence is all their force of argument
Drawn forth against thee or from the abuse
Of thy great powers in adulterate brains
When would men learn but to distinguish spirits
And set true difference 'twixt those jaded wits
That run a broken pace for common hire
And the high raptures of a happy muse
Borne on the wings of her immortal thought
That kicks at earth with a disdainful heel
And beats at heaven gates with her bright hoofs
They would not then with such distorted faces
And desperate censures stab at Poesy
They would admire bright knowledge and their minds
Should ne'er descend on so unworthy objects
As gold or titles they would dread far more
To be thought ignorant than be known poor
The time was once when wit drown'd wealth but now
Your only barbarism is t'have wit and want
No matter now in virtue who excels
He that hath coin hath all perfection else
True but my sweet Tibullus keep that secret
I would not for all Rome it should be thought
I veil bright Julia underneath that name
Julia the gem and jewel of my soul
That takes her honours from the golden sky
As beauty doth all lustre from her eye
The air respires the pure Elysian sweets
In which she breathes and from her looks descend
The glories of the summer Heaven she is
Praised in herself above all praise and he
Which hears her speak would swear the tuneful orbs
Turn'd in his zenith only
O in no labyrinth can I safelier err
Than when I lose myself in praising her
Hence law and welcome Muses though not rich
Yet are you pleasing let be reconciled
And new made one Henceforth I promise faith
And all my serious hours to spend with you
With you whose music striketh on my heart
And with bewitching tones steals forth my spirit
In Julia name fair Julia Julia love
Shall be a law and that sweet law I'll study
The law and art of sacred Julia love
All other objects will but abjects prove

Let us not blame him for against such chances
The heartiest strife of virtue is not proof
We may read constancy and fortitude
To other souls but had ourselves been struck
With the like planet had our loves like his
Been ravish'd from us by injurious death
And in the height and heat of our best days
It would have crack'd our sinews shrunk our veins
And made our very heart-strings jar like his
Come let go take him forth and prove if mirth
Or company will but abate his passion
She told me I should surely never perish
By famine poison or the enemy sword
The hectic fever cough or pleurisy
Should never hurt me nor the tardy gout
But in my time I should be once surprised
By a strong tedious talker that should vex
And almost bring me to consumption
Therefore if I were wise she warn'd me shun
All such long-winded monsters as my bane
For if I could but 'scape that one discourser
I might no doubt prove an old aged man—
On hellespont guilty of truelove blood
In view and opposite two cities stood
Seaborderers disjoined by neptune might
The one abydos the other sestos hight
At sestos Hero dwelt Hero the fair
Whom young apollo courted for her hair
And offered as a dower his burning throne
Where she should sit for men to gaze upon
The outside of her garments were of lawn
The lining purple silk with gilt stars drawn
Her wide sleeves green and bordered with a grove
Where venus in her naked glory strove
To please the careless and disdainful eyes
Of proud adonis that before her lies
Her kirtle blue whereon was many a stain
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain
Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath
From whence her veil reached to the ground beneath
Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives
Many would praise the sweet smell as she passed
When 'twas the odor which her breath forth cast
And there for honey bees have sought in vain
And beat from thence have lighted there again
About her neck hung chains of pebblestone
Which lightened by her neck like diamonds shone
She ware no gloves for neither sun nor wind
Would burn or parch her hands but to her mind
Or warm or cool them for they took delight
To play upon those hands they were so white
Buskins of shells all silvered used she
And branched with blushing coral to the knee
Where sparrows perched of hollow pearl and gold
Such as the world would wonder to behold
Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills
Which as she went would chirrup through the bills
Some say for her the fairest cupid pined
And looking in her face was strooken blind
But this is true so like was one the other
As he imagined Hero was his mother
And oftentimes into her bosom flew
And laid his childish head upon her breast
And with still panting rocked there took his rest
So lovely fair was Hero venus' nun
As nature wept thinking she was undone
Because she took more from her than she left
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft
Therefore in sign her treasure suffered wrack
Since Hero time hath half the world been black
Amorous Leander beautiful and young
whose tragedy divine musaeus sung
Dwelt at abydos since him dwelt there none
For whom succeeding times make greater moan
His dangling tresses that were never shorn
Had they been cut and unto colchos borne
Would have allured the vent'rous youth of greece
To hazard more than for the golden fleece
Fair cynthia wished his arms might be her sphere
Grief makes her pale because she moves not there
His body was as straight as circe wand
Jove might have sipped out nectar from his hand
Even as delicious meat is to the taste
So was his neck in touching and surpassed
The white of pelops' shoulder i could tell ye
How smooth his breast was and how white his belly
And whose immortal fingers did imprint
That heavenly path with many a curious dint
That runs along his back but my rude pen
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men
Much less of powerful gods let it suffice
That my slack muse sings of Leander eyes
Those orient cheeks and lips exceeding his
That leaped into the water for a kiss
Of his own shadow and despising many
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any
Had wild hippolytus Leander seen
Enamored of his beauty had he been
His presence made the rudest peasant melt
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt
The barbarous thracian soldier moved with nought
Was moved with him and for his favor sought
Some swore he was a maid in man attire
For in his looks were all that men desire
A pleasant smiling cheek a speaking eye
And such as knew he was a man would say
Leander thou art made for amorous play
Why art thou not in love and loved of all
Though thou be fair yet be not thine own thrall
 the men of wealthy sestos every year
for his sake whom their goddess held so dear
Rose-cheeked adonis kept a solemn feast
Thither resorted many a wandering guest
To meet their loves such as had none at all
Came lovers home from this great festival
For every street like to a firmament
Glistered with breathing stars who where they went
Frighted the melancholy earth which deemed
Eternal heaven to burn for so it seemed
As if another phaeton had got
The guidance of the sun rich chariot
But far above the loveliest Hero shined
And stole away th' enchanted gazer mind
For like sea nymphs' enveigling harmony
So was her beauty to the standers by
Nor that night-wandering pale and wat'ry star
when yawning dragons draw her thirling car
From latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky
Where crowned with blazing light and majesty
She proudly sits more overrules the flood
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood
Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase
Wretched ixion shaggy footed race
Incensed with savage heat gallop amain
From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain
So ran the people forth to gaze upon her
And all that viewed her were enamored on her
And as in fury of a dreadful fight
Their fellows being slain or put to flight
Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead strooken
So at her presence all surprised and tooken
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes
He whom she favors lives the other dies
There might you see one sigh another rage
And some their violent passions to assuage
Compile sharp satires but alas too late
For faithful love will never turn to hate
And many seeing great princes were denied
On this feast day o cursed day and hour
Went Hero thorough sestos from her tower
To venus' temple where unhappily
As after chanced they did each other spy
So fair a church as this had venus none
The walls were of discolored jasper stone
Wherein was proteus carved and o'erhead
A lively vine of green sea agate spread
Where by one hand lightheaded bacchus hung
And with the other wine from grapes out wrung
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was
The town of sestos called it venus' glass
There might you see the gods in sundry shapes
Committing heady riots incest rapes
For know that underneath this radiant floor
Was danae statue in a brazen tower
Jove slyly stealing from his sister bed
To dally with idalian ganymede
And for his love europa bellowing loud
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud
Blood quaffing mars heaving the iron net
Which limping vulcan and his cyclops set
Love kindling fire to burn such towns as troy
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy
That now is turned into a cypress tree
Under whose shade the wood gods love to be
And in the midst a silver altar stood
There Hero sacrificing turtle blood
Vailed to the ground vailing her eyelids close
And modestly they opened as she rose
Thence flew love arrow with the golden head
And thus Leander was enamored
Stone still he stood and evermore he gazed
Till with the fire that from his countenance blazed
Relenting Hero gentle heart was strook
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look
 it lies not in our power to love or hate
For will in us is overruled by fate
When two are stripped long ere the course begin
We wish that one should lose the other win
And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots like in each respect
The reason no man knows let it suffice
What we behold is censured by our eyes
Who ever loved that loved not at first sight
 he kneeled but unto her devoutly prayed
Chaste Hero to herself thus softly said
were i the saint he worships i would hear him
And as she spake those words came somewhat near him
He started up she blushed as one ashamed
Wherewith Leander much more was inflamed
He touched her hand in touching it she trembled
Love deeply grounded hardly is dissembled
These lovers parleyed by the touch of hands
True love is mute and oft amazed stands
Thus while dumb signs their yielding hearts entangled
The air with sparks of living fire was spangled
And night deep drenched in misty acHeron
Heaved up her head and half the world upon
Breathed darkness forth dark night is cupid day
And now begins Leander to display
Love holy fire with words with sighs and tears
Which like sweet music entered Hero ears
And yet at every word she turned aside
And always cut him off as he replied
At last like to a bold sharp sophister
With cheerful hope thus he accosted her
 fair creature let me speak without offense
I would my rude words had the influence
To lead thy thoughts as thy fair looks do mine
Then shouldst thou be his prisoner who is thine
Be not unkind and fair misshapen stuff
Are of behavior boisterous and rough
O shun me not but hear me ere you go
God knows i cannot force love as you do
My words shall be as spotless as my youth
Full of simplicity and naked truth
This sacrifice whose sweet perfume descending
From venus' altar to your footsteps bending
Doth testify that you exceed her far
To whom you offer and whose nun you are
Why should you worship her her you surpass
As much as sparkling diamonds flaring glass
A diamond set in lead his worth retains
A heavenly nymph beloved of human swains
Receives no blemish but ofttimes more grace
Base in respect of thee divine and pure
Dutiful service may thy love procure
And i in duty will excel all other
As thou in beauty dost exceed love mother
Nor heaven nor thou were made to gaze upon
As heaven preserves all things so save thou one
A stately builded ship well rigged and tall
The ocean maketh more majestical
Why vowest thou then to live in sestos here
Who on love seas more glorious wouldst appear
Like untuned golden strings all women are
Which long time lie untouched will harshly jar
Vessels of brass oft handled brightly shine
What difference betwixt the richest mine
And basest mold but use for both not used
Are of like worth then treasure is abused
When misers keep it being put to loan
In time it will return us two for one
Rich robes themselves and others do adorn
Neither themselves nor others if not worn
Who builds a palace and rams up the gate
Shall see it ruinous and desolate
Ah simple Hero learn thyself to cherish
Lone women like to empty houses perish
Less sins the poor rich man that starves himself
In heaping up a mass of drossy pelf
Than such as you his golden earth remains
Which after his decease some other gains
But this fair gem sweet in the loss alone
When you fleet hence can be bequeathed to none
Or if it could down from th' enameled sky
All heaven would come to claim this legacy
And with intestine broils the world destroy
And quite confound nature sweet harmony
Well therefore by the gods decreed it is
We human creatures should enjoy that bliss
One is no number maids are nothing then
Without the sweet society of men
Wilt thou live single still one shalt thou be
Though never singling hymen couple thee
Wild savages that drink of running springs
Think water far excels all earthly things
But they that daily taste neat wine despise it
Compared with marriage had you tried them both
Differs as much as wine and water doth
Base bullion for the stamp sake we allow
Even so for men impression do we you
By which alone our reverend fathers say
Women receive perfection every way
This idol which you term virginity
Is neither essence subject to the eye
No nor to any one exterior sense
Nor hath it any place of residence
Nor is't of earth or mold celestial
Or capable of any form at all
Of that which hath no being do not boast
Things that are not at all are never lost
Men foolishly do call it virtuous
What virtue is it that is born with us
Much less can honor be ascribed thereto
Honor is purchased by the deeds we do
Believe me Hero honor is not won
Until some honorable deed be done
Seek you for chastity immortal fame
And know that some have wronged diana name
Whose name is it if she be false or not
So she be fair but some vile tongues will blot
But you are fair ay me so wondrous fair
So young so gentle and so debonair
As greece will think if thus you live alone
Some one or other keeps you as his own
Then Hero hate me not nor from me fly
To follow swiftly blasting infamy
Perhaps thy sacred priesthood makes thee loath
Tell me to whom mad'st thou that heedless oath
 to venus answered she and as she spake
Forth from those two tralucent cisterns brake
A stream of liquid pearl which down her face
Made milk-white paths whereon the gods might trace
To jove high court he thus replied the rites
In which love beauteous empress most delights
Are banquets doric music midnight revel
Plays masks and all that stern age counteth evil
Thee as a holy idiot doth she scorn
For thou in vowing chastity hast sworn
To rob her name and honor and thereby
Committ'st a sin far worse than perjury
Even sacrilege against her deity
To expiate which sin kiss and shake hands
Such sacrifice as this venus demands
 thereat she smiled and did deny him so
As put thereby yet might he hope for moe
Which makes him quickly re-enforce his speech
And her in humble manner thus beseech
 though neither gods nor men may thee deserve
Yet for her sake whom you have vowed to serve
Abandon fruitless cold virginity
The gentle queen of love sole enemy
Then shall you most resemble venus' nun
When venus' sweet rites are performed and done
Flint-breasted pallas joys in single life
But pallas and your mistress are at strife
Love Hero then and be not tyrannous
But heal the heart that thou hast wounded thus
Nor stain thy youthful years with avarice
Fair fools delight to be accounted nice
The richest corn dies if it be not reaped
Beauty alone is lost too warily kept
These arguments he used and many more
Wherewith she yielded that was won before
Hero looks yielded but her words made war
Women are won when they begin to jar
Thus having swallowed cupid golden hook
The more she strived the deeper was she strook
Yet evilly feigning anger strove she still
And would be thought to grant against her will
So having paused a while at last she said
who taught thee rhetoric to deceive a maid
Ay me such words as these should i abhor
And yet i like them for the orator
 with that Leander stooped to have embraced her
But from his spreading arms away she cast her
And thus bespake him gentle youth forbear
To touch the sacred garments which i wear
Upon a rock and underneath a hill
Far from the town where all is whist and still
Save that the sea playing on yellow sand
Sends forth a rattling murmur to the land
Whose sound allures the golden morpheus
In silence of the night to visit us
My turret stands and there god knows i play
A dwarfish beldam bears me company
That hops about the chamber where i lie
And spends the night that might be better spent
In vain discourse and apish merriment
Come thither as she spake this her tongue tripped
For unawares come thither from her slipped
And suddenly her former color changed
And here and there her eyes through anger ranged
And like a planet moving several ways
At one self instant she poor soul assays
Loving not to love at all and every part
Strove to resist the motions of her heart
And hands so pure so innocent nay such
As might have made heaven stoop to have a touch
Did she uphold to venus and again
Vowed spotless chastity but all in vain
Cupid beats down her prayers with his wings
Her vows above the empty air he flings
All deep enraged his sinewy bow he bent
And shot a shaft that burning from him went
Wherewith she strooken looked so dolefully
As made love sigh to see his tyranny
And as she wept her tears to pearl he turned
And wound them on his arm and for her mourned
Then towards the palace of the destinies
Laden with languishment and grief he flies
And to those stern nymphs humbly made request
Both might enjoy each other and be blest
But with a ghastly dreadful countenance
Threatening a thousand deaths at every glance
They answered love nor would vouchsafe so much
As one poor word their hate to him was such
Hearken a while and i will tell you why
Heaven winged herald jove-borne mercury
The selfsame day that he asleep had laid
Enchanted argus spied a country maid
Whose careless hair instead of pearl t' adorn it
Glistered with dew as one that seemed to scorn it
Her breath as fragrant as the morning rose
Her mind pure and her tongue untaught to gloze
Yet proud she was for lofty pride that dwells
In towered courts is oft in shepherds' cells
And silver tincture of her cheeks that drew
The love of every swain on her this god
Enamored was and with his snaky rod
Did charm her nimble feet and made her stay
The while upon a hillock down he lay
And sweetly on his pipe began to play
And with smooth speech her fancy to assay
Till in his twining arms he locked her fast
And then he wooed with kisses and at last
As shepherds do her on the ground he laid
And tumbling in the grass he often strayed
Beyond the bounds of shame in being bold
To eye those parts which no eye should behold
And like an insolent commanding lover
Boasting his parentage would needs discover
The way to new elysium but she
Whose only dower was her chastity
Having striv'n in vain was now about to cry
And crave the help of shepherds that were nigh
Herewith he stayed his fury and began
To give her leave to rise away she ran
After went mercury who used such cunning
As she to hear his tale left off her running
Maids are not won by brutish force and might
But speeches full of pleasure and delight
And knowing hermes courted her was glad
That she such loveliness and beauty had
As could provoke his liking yet was mute
And neither would deny nor grant his suit
Still vowed he love she wanting no excuse
To feed him with delays as women use
Or thirsting after immortality
All women are ambitious naturally
Imposed upon her lover such a task
As he ought not perform nor yet she ask
A draught of flowing nectar she requested
Wherewith the king of gods and men is feasted
He ready to accomplish what she willed
Stole some from hebe hebe jove cup filled
And gave it to his simple rustic love
Which being known as what is hid from jove
He inly stormed and waxed more furious
Than for the fire filched by prometheus
And thrusts him down from heaven he wandering here
Complained to cupid cupid for his sake
To be revenged on jove did undertake
And those on whom heaven earth and hell relies
I mean the adamantine destinies
He wounds with love and forced them equally
To dote upon deceitful mercury
They offered him the deadly fatal knife
That shears the slender threads of human life
At his fair feathered feet the engines laid
Which th' earth from ugly chaos' den upweighed
These he regarded not but did entreat
That jove usurper of his father seat
Might presently be banished into hell
And aged saturn in olympus dwell
They granted what he craved and once again
Saturn and ops began their golden reign
Murder rape war lust and treachery
Were with jove closed in stygian empery
But long this blessed time continued not
As soon as he his wished purpose got
He reckless of his promise did despise
The love of th' everlasting destinies
They seeing it both love and him abhorred
And jupiter unto his place restored
And but that learning in despite of fate
Will mount aloft and enter heaven gate
And to the seat of jove itself advance
Hermes had slept in hell with ignorance
Yet as a punishment they added this
That he and poverty should always kiss
And to this day is every scholar poor
Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor
Likewise the angry sisters thus deluded
To venge themselves on hermes have concluded
That midas' brood shall sit in honor chair
To which the muses' sons are only heir
And fruitful wits that in aspiring are
Shall discontent run into regions far
And few great lords in virtuous deeds shall joy
But be surprised with every garish toy
And still enrich the lofty servile clown
Who with encroaching guile keeps learning down
Then muse not cupid suit no better sped
Seeing in their loves the fates were injured
Viewing Leander face fell down and fainted
He kissed her and breathed life into her lips
Wherewith as one displeased away she trips
Yet as she went full often looked behind
And many poor excuses did she find
To linger by the way and once she stayed
And would have turned again but was afraid
In offering parley to be counted light
So on she goes and in her idle flight
Her painted fan of curled plumes let fall
Thinking to train Leander therewithal
He being a novice knew not what she meant
But stayed and after her a letter sent
Which joyful Hero answered in such sort
As he had hope to scale the beauteous fort
Wherein the liberal graces locked their wealth
And therefore to her tower he got by stealth
Wide open stood the door he need not climb
And she herself before the pointed time
Had spread the board with roses strowed the room
And oft looked out and mused he did not come
At last he came o who can tell the greeting
These greedy lovers had at their first meeting
He asked she gave and nothing was denied
Both to each other quickly were affied
Look how their hands so were their hearts united
And what he did she willingly requited
sweet are the kisses the embracements sweet
When like desires and affections meet
For from the earth to heaven is cupid raised
Where fancy is in equal balance peised
Yet she this rashness suddenly repented
And turned aside and to herself lamented
As if her name and honor had been wronged
By being possessed of him for whom she longed
Ay and she wished albeit not from her heart
That he would leave her turret and depart
The mirthful god of amorous pleasure smiled
To see how he this captive nymph beguiled
For hitherto he did but fan the fire
And kept it down that it might mount the higher
Now waxed she jealous lest his love abated
Therefore unto him hastily she goes
And like light salmacis her body throws
Upon his bosom where with yielding eyes
She offers up herself a sacrifice
To slake his anger if he were displeased
O what god would not therewith be appeased
Like aesop cock this jewel he enjoyed
And as a brother with his sister toyed
Supposing nothing else was to be done
Now he her favor and good will had won
But know you not that creatures wanting sense
By nature have a mutual appetence
And wanting organs to advance a step
Moved by love force unto each other lep
Much more in subjects having intellect
Some hidden influence breeds like effect
Albeit Leander rude in love and raw
Long dallying with Hero nothing saw
That might delight him more yet he suspected
Some amorous rites or other were neglected
Therefore unto his body hers he clung
She fearing on the rushes to be flung
Strived with redoubled strength the more she strived
The more a gentle pleasing heat revived
Which taught him all that elder lovers know
And now the same gan so to scorch and glow
As in plain terms yet cunningly he craved it
Love always makes those eloquent that have it
She with a kind of granting put him by it
And ever as he thought himself most nigh it
Like to the tree of tantalus she fled
And seeming lavish saved her maidenhead
Ne'er king more sought to keep his diadem
Than Hero this inestimable gem
Above our life we love a steadfast friend
Yet when a token of great worth we send
We often kiss it often look thereon
And stay the messenger that would be gone
No marvel then though Hero would not yield
So soon to part from that she dearly held
Jewels being lost are found again this never
'tis lost but once and once lost lost forever
 now had the morn espied her lover steeds
Whereat she starts puts on her purple weeds
All headlong throws herself the clouds among
And now Leander fearing to be missed
Embraced her suddenly took leave and kissed
Long was he taking leave and loath to go
And kissed again as lovers use to do
Sad Hero wrung him by the hand and wept
Saying let your vows and promises be kept
Then standing at the door she turned about
As loath to see Leander going out
And now the sun that through th' horizon peeps
As pitying these lovers downward creeps
So that in silence of the cloudy night
Though it was morning did he take his flight
But what the secret trusty night concealed
Leander amorous habit soon revealed
With cupid myrtle was his bonnet crowned
About his arms the purple riband wound
Wherewith she wreathed her largely spreading hair
Nor could the youth abstain but he must wear
The sacred ring wherewith she was endowed
When first religious chastity she vowed
Which made his love through sestos to be known
And thence unto abydos sooner blown
Than he could sail for incorporeal fame
Whose weight consists in nothing but her name
Is swifter than the wind whose tardy plumes
Are reeking water and dull earthly fumes
Home when he came he seemed not to be there
But like exiled air thrust from his sphere
Set in a foreign place and straight from thence
Alcides like by mighty violence
He would have chased away the swelling main
That him from her unjustly did detain
Like as the sun in a diameter
Fires and inflames objects removed far
And heateth kindly shining laterally
So beauty sweetly quickens when 'tis nigh
But being separated and removed
Burns where it cherished murders where it loved
Therefore even as an index to a book
So to his mind was young Leander look
O none but gods have power their love to hide
Affection by the countenance is descried
The light of hidden fire itself discovers
His secret flame apparently was seen
Leander father knew where he had been
And for the same mildly rebuked his son
Thinking to quench the sparkles new begun
But love resisted once grows passionate
And nothing more than counsel lovers hate
For as a hot proud horse highly disdains
To have his head controlled but breaks the reins
Spits forth the ringled bit and with his hooves
Checks the submissive ground so he that loves
The more he is restrained the worse he fares
What is it now but mad Leander dares
o Hero Hero thus he cried full oft
And then he got him to a rock aloft
Where having spied her tower long stared he on't
And prayed the narrow toiling hellespont
To part in twain that he might come and go
But still the rising billows answered no
With that he stripped him to the ivory skin
And crying love i come leaped lively in
Whereat the sapphire visaged god grew proud
And made his capering triton sound aloud
Imagining that ganymede displeased
Had left the heavens therefore on him he seized
Leander strived the waves about him wound
And pulled him to the bottom where the ground
Was strewed with pearl and in low coral groves
Sweet singing mermaids sported with their loves
On heaps of heavy gold and took great pleasure
To spurn in careless sort the shipwrack treasure
For here the stately azure palace stood
Where kingly neptune and his train abode
The lusty god embraced him called him love
And swore he never should return to jove
But when he knew it was not ganymede
For under water he was almost dead
He heaved him up and looking on his face
Beat down the bold waves with his triple mace
Which mounted up intending to have kissed him
And fell in drops like tears because they missed him
Leander being up began to swim
And looking back saw neptune follow him
o let me visit Hero ere i die
The god put helle bracelet on his arm
And swore the sea should never do him harm
He clapped his plump cheeks with his tresses played
And smiling wantonly his love bewrayed
He watched his arms and as they opened wide
At every stroke betwixt them would he slide
And steal a kiss and then run out and dance
And as he turned cast many a lustful glance
And threw him gaudy toys to please his eye
And dive into the water and there pry
Upon his breast his thighs and every limb
And up again and close beside him swim
And talk of love Leander made reply
you are deceived i am no woman i
Thereat smiled neptune and then told a tale
How that a shepherd sitting in a vale
Played with a boy so fair and kind
As for his love both earth and heaven pined
That of the cooling river durst not drink
Lest water nymphs should pull him from the brink
And when he sported in the fragrant lawns
Goat footed satyrs and upstaring fawns
Would steal him thence ere half this tale was done
ay me Leander cried th' enamored sun
That now should shine on thetis' glassy bower
Descends upon my radiant Hero tower
O that these tardy arms of mine were wings
And as he spake upon the waves he springs
Neptune was angry that he gave no ear
And in his heart revenging malice bare
He flung at him his mace but as it went
He called it in for love made him repent
The mace returning back his own hand hit
As meaning to be venged for darting it
When this fresh bleeding wound Leander viewed
His color went and came as if he rued
The grief which neptune felt in gentle breasts
Relenting thoughts remorse and pity rests
And who have hard hearts and obdurate minds
But vicious harebrained and illiterate hinds
The god seeing him with pity to be moved
Thereon concluded that he was beloved
With folly and false hope deluding us
Wherefore Leander fancy to surprise
To the rich ocean for gifts he flies
'tis wisdom to give much a gift prevails
When deep persuading oratory fails
By this Leander being near the land
Cast down his weary feet and felt the sand
Breathless albeit he were he rested not
Till to the solitary tower he got
And knocked and called at which celestial noise
The longing heart of Hero much more joys
Than nymphs and shepherds when the timbrel rings
Or crooked dolphin when the sailor sings
She stayed not for her robes but straight arose
And drunk with gladness to the door she goes
Where seeing a naked man she screeched for fear
such sights as this to tender maids are rare
And ran into the dark herself to hide
rich jewels in the dark are soonest spied
Unto her was he led or rather drawn
By those white limbs which sparkled through the lawn
The nearer that he came the more she fled
And seeking refuge slipped into her bed
Whereon Leander sitting thus began
Through numbing cold all feeble faint and wan
 if not for love yet love for pity sake
Me in thy bed and maiden bosom take
At least vouchsafe these arms some little room
Who hoping to embrace thee cheerly swum
This head was beat with many a churlish billow
And therefore let it rest upon thy pillow
Herewith affrighted Hero shrunk away
And in her lukewarm place Leander lay
Whose lively heat like fire from heaven fet
Would animate gross clay and higher set
The drooping thoughts of base declining souls
Than dreary mars carousing nectar bowls
His hands he cast upon her like a snare
She overcome with shame and sallow fear
Like chaste diana when actaeon spied her
Being suddenly betrayed dived down to hide her
And as her silver body downward went
With both her hands she made the bed a tent
O'ercast with dim and darksome coverture
And now she lets him whisper in her ear
Flatter entreat promise protest and swear
Yet ever as he greedily assayed
To touch those dainties she the harpy played
And every limb did as a soldier stout
Defend the fort and keep the foeman out
For though the rising ivory mount he scaled
Which is with azure circling lines empaled
Much like a globe a globe may i term this
By which love sails to regions full of bliss
Yet there with sisyphus he toiled in vain
Till gentle parley did the truce obtain
Wherein Leander on her quivering breast
Breathless spoke something and sighed out the rest
Which so prevailed as he with small ado
Enclosed her in his arms and kissed her too
And every kiss to her was as a charm
And to Leander as a fresh alarm
So that the truce was broke and she alas
poor silly maiden at his mercy was
Love is not full of pity as men say
But deaf and cruel where he means to prey
Even as a bird which in our hands we wring
Forth plungeth and oft flutters with her wing
She trembling strove this strife of hers like that
Which made the world another world begat
Of unknown joy treason was in her thought
And cunningly to yield herself she sought
Seeming not won yet won she was at length
In such wars women use but half their strength
Leander now like theban hercules
Entered the orchard of th' hesperides
Whose fruit none rightly can describe but he
That pulls or shakes it from the golden tree
And now she wished this night were never done
And sighed to think upon th' approaching sun
For much it grieved her that the bright daylight
Should know the pleasure of this blessed night
And them like mars and erycine display
Both in each other arms chained as they lay
Again she knew not how to frame her look
Or speak to him who in a moment took
And fain by stealth away she would have crept
And to some corner secretly have gone
Leaving Leander in the bed alone
But as her naked feet were whipping out
He on the sudden clinged her so about
That mermaidlike unto the floor she slid
One half appeared the other half was hid
Thus near the bed she blushing stood upright
And from her countenance behold ye might
A kind of twilight break which through the hair
As from an orient cloud glimpsed here and there
And round about the chamber this false morn
Brought forth the day before the day was born
So Hero ruddy cheek Hero betrayed
And her all naked to his sight displayed
Whence his admiring eyes more pleasure took
Than dis on heaps of gold fixing his look
By this apollo golden harp began
To sound forth music to the ocean
Which watchful hesperus no sooner heard
But he the bright day-bearing car prepared
And ran before as harbinger of light
And with his flaring beams mocked ugly night
Till she o'ercome with anguish shame and rage
Danged down to hell her loathsome carriage
But envious brains do nought or light esteem
Such stately steps as they cannot attain 
For whoso reaps renown above the rest
With heaps of hate shall surely be oppressed
Wherefore to write my censure of this book
This Glass of Steel unpartially doth show
Abuses all to such as in it look
From prince to poor from high estate to low
As for the verse who list like trade to try
I fear me much shall hardly reach so high
What could they say to win again my grace —
Forsooth that they had seen my mistress' face
Another time my heart I called to mind —
Thinking that he this woe on me had brought
Because that he to love his force resigned
When of such wars my fancy never thought 
What could he say when I would him have slain —
That he was hers and had forgone my chain
At last when I perceived both eyes and heart
Excuse themselves as guiltless of my ill
I found myself the cause of all my smart
And told myself that I myself would kill 
Yet when I saw myself to you was true
I loved myself because myself loved you
Yet rich in zeal though poor in learning lore
And friendly care obscured in secret breast
And love that envy in thy life suppressed —
Thy dear life done — and death hath doubled more
And I that in thy time and Hving state
Did only praise thy virtues in my thought
As one that seeld the rising sun hath sought
With words and tears now wail thy timeless fate
Drawn was thy race aright from princely line 
Nor less than such by gifts that nature gave —
The common mother that all creatures have —
Doth virtue show and princely lineage shine
A king gave thee thy name a kingly mind —
That God thee gave — who found it now too dear
For this base world and hath resumed it near
To sit in skies and sort with powers divine
Kent thy birth-days and Oxford held thy youth 
The heavens made haste and stayed nor years nor time 
The fruits of age grew ripe in thy first prime 
Thy will thy words thy words the seals of truth
Great gifts and wisdom rare employed thee thence
To treat from kings with those more great than kings 
Such hope men had to lay the highest things
On thy wise youth to be transported hence 
Whence to sharp wars sweet honour did thee call
Thy country love religion and thy friends 
Of worthy men the marks the lives and ends
And her defence for whom we labour all
There didst thou vanquish shame and tedious age
Grief sorrow sickness and base fortune might
Thy rising day saw never woeful night
But passed with praise from off this worldly stage
Back to the camp by thee that day was brought
First thine own death and after thy long fame
Tears to the soldiers the proud Castilian shame 
Virtue expressed and honour truly taught
What hath he lost that such great grace hath won 
Young years for endless years and hope unsure
Of fortune gifts for wealth that still shall dure 
Q happy race with so great praises run 
England doth hold thy limbs that bred the same 
Flanders thy valour where it last was tried 
The camp thy sorrow where thy body died 
Thy friends thy want the world thy virtue fame 
Nations thy wit our minds lay up thy love 
Letters thy learning thy loss years long to come 
In worthy hearts sorrow hath made thy tomb 
Thy soul and spright enrich the heavens above
Thy liberal heart embalmed in grateful tears
Young sighs sweet sighs sage sighs bewail thy fall
Envy her sting and spite hath left her gall 
Malice herself a mourning garment wears
That day their Hannibal died our Scipio fell—
Scipio Cicero and Petrarch of our time 
Whose virtues wounded by my worthless rhyme
Let angels speak and heaven thy praises tell
Was wont to burn and passing by that way
To see that buried dust of living fame
Whose tomb fair Love and fairer Virtue kept
All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen
At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept 
And from thenceforth those graces were not seen
For they this Queen attended in whose stead
Oblivion laid him down on Laura hearse
Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed
And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce 
Where Homer spright did tremble all for grief
And cursed the access of that celestial thief
A gown of grief my body shall attire
And broken hope shall be my strength and stay
And late repentance linked with long desire
Shall be the couch whereon my limbs lay
And at my gates despair shall linger still
To let in death when love and fortune will
My food shall be of care and sorrow made 
My drink nought else but tears fallen from mine eyes 
And for my light in such obscured shade
The flames may serve which from my heart arise
And at my gates despair shall linger still
To let in death when love and fortune will
My lost delights now clean from sight of land
Have left me all alone in unknown ways
My mind to woe my life in fortune hand 
Of all which past the sorrow only stays
As in a country strange without companion
I only wail the wrong of death delays
Whose sweet spring spent whose summer well nigh done 
Of all which past the sorrow only stays 
Whom care forewarns ere age and winter cold
To haste me hence to find my fortune fold
Therefore take heed let fancy never swerve
But unto him that will take leaves and all 
For this be sure the flower once plucked avay
Farewell the rest thy happy days decay 
Many desire but few or none deserve
To cut the corn not subject to the sickle 
Therefore take heed let fancy never swerve
But constant stand for mowers' minds are fickle 
For this be sure the crop being once obtained
Farewell the rest the soil will be disdained
Four kings shall be assembled in this isle
Where they shall keep great tumult for awhile
Many men then shall have an end of crosses
And many likewise shall sustain great losses 
Many that now full joyful are and glad
Shall at that time be sorrowful and sad 
Full many a Christian heart shall quake for fear
The dreadful sound of trump when he shall hear
Dead bones shall then be tumbled up and down
In every city and in every town
By day or night this tumult shall not cease
Until an herald shall proclaim a peace 
An herald strong the like was never born
Whose very beard is flesh and mouth is horn
We should begin by such a parting light
To write the story of all ages past
And end the same before the approaching night
Such is again the labour of my mind
Whose shroud by sorrow woven now to end
Hath seen that ever shining sun declined
So many years that so could not descend
But that the eyes of my mind held her beams
In every part transferred by love swift thought 
Far off or near in waking or in dreams
Imagination strong their lustre brought
Such force her angelic appearance had
To master distance time or cruelty 
Such art to grieve and after to make glad 
Such fear in love such love in majesty
My weary lines her memory embalmed 
My darkest ways her eyes make clear as day
What storms so great but Cynthia beams appeased 
What rage so fierce that love could not allay 
Twelve years entire I wasted in this war 
Twelve years of my most happy younger days 
But I in them and they now wasted are 
 Of all which past the sorrow only stays
So wrote I once and my mishap foretold
My mind still feeling sorrowful success 
Even as before a storm the marble cold
Doth by moist tears tempestuous times express
So felt my heavy mind my harms at hand
Which my vain thought in vain sought to recure 
At middle day my sun seemed under land
When any little cloud did it obscure
And as the icicles in a winter day
Whenas the sun shines with unwonted warm
So did my joys melt into secret tears 
So did my heart dissolve in wasting drops 
And as the season of the year outwears
And heaps of snow from off the mountain tops
• With sudden streams the valleys overflow
So did the time draw on my more despair 
Then floods of sorrow and whole seas of woe
The banks of all my hope did overbear
And drowned my mind in depths of misery 
Sometime I died sometime I was distract
My soul the stage of fancy tragedy 
Then furious madness where true reason lacked
Wrote what it would and scourged mine own conceit
Oh heavy heart who can thee witness bear 
What tongue what pen could thy tormenting treat
But thine own mourning thoughts which present were 
What stranger mind believe the meanest part 
What altered sense conceive the weakest woe
That tare that rent that pierced thy sad heart 
And as a man distract with triple might
Bound in strong chains doth strive and rage in vain
Till tired and breathless he is forced to rest —
Finds by contention but increase of pain
And fiery heat inflamed in swollen breast 
So did my mind in change of passion
From woe to wrath from wrath return to woe
Struggling in vain from love subjection 
Therefore all lifeless and all helpless bound
My fainting spirits sunk and heart appalled
My joys and hopes lay bleeding on the ground
That not long since the highest heaven scaled
I hated life and cursed destiny 
The thoughts of passed times like flames of hell
Kindled afresh within my memory
The many dear achievements that befell
In those prime years and infancy of love
Which to describe were but to die in writing 
Ah those I sought but vainly to remove
And vainly shall by which I perish living
And though strong reason hold before mine eyes
The images and forms of worlds past
Teaching the cause why all those flames that rise
From forms external can no longer last
Than that those seeming beauties hold in prime
Love ground his essence and his empery
All slaves to age and vassals unto time
Of which repentance writes the tragedy —
But this my heart desire could not conceive
Whose love outflew the fastest flying time
A beauty that can easily deceive
The arrest of years and creeping age outclimb
A spring of beauties which time ripeth not —
Time that but works on frail mortality 
A sweetness which woe wrongs outwipeth not
Whom love hath chose for his divinity 
A vestal fire that burns but never wasteth
That loseth nought by giving light to all
That endless shines each where and endless lasteth
Blossoms of pride that can nor fade nor fall 
These were those marvellous perfections
The parents of my sorrow and my envy
Most deathful and most violent infections 
These be the tyrants that in fetters tie
Their wounded vassals yet nor kill nor cure
But glory in their lasting misery —
That as her beauties would our woes should dure —
These be the effects of powerful empery
Yet have these wounders want which want compassion 
Yet hath her mind some marks of human race 
Yet will she be a woman for a fashion
So doth she please her virtues to deface
And like as that immortal power doth seat
An element of waters to allay
The fiery sunbeams that on earth do beat
And temper by cold night the heat of day
So hath perfection which begat her mind
Added thereto a change of fantasy
And left her the affections of her kind
Yet free from every evil but cruelty
But leave her praise speak thou of nought but woe 
Write on the tale that sorrow bids thee tell 
Strive to forget and care no more to know
Thy cares are known by knowing those too well
Describe her now as she appears to thee 
Not as she did appear in days fordone 
In love those things that were no more may be
For fancy seldom ends where it begun
And as a stream by strong hand bounded in
From nature course where it did sometime run
By some small rent or loose part doth begin
To find escape till it a way hath won 
Doth then all unawares in sunder tear
The forced bounds and raging run at large
In the ancient channels as they wonted were 
Such is of women love the careful charge —
Held and maintained with multitude of woes 
Of long erections such the sudden fall 
One hour diverts one instant overthrows
For which our lives for which our fortune thrall
So many years those joys have dearly bought 
Of which when our fond hopes do most assure
All is dissolved our labours come to nought 
Nor any mark thereof there doth endure 
No more than when small drops of rain do fall
Upon the parched ground by heat updried 
No cooling moisture is perceived at all
Nor any show or sign of wet doth bide
But as the fields clothed with leaves and flowers
The banks of roses smelling precious sweet
Have but their beauty date and timely hours
And then defaced by winter cold and sleet
So far as neither fruit nor form of flower
Stays for a witness what such branches bare
But as time gave time did again devour
And change our rising joy to falling care 
So of affection which our youth presented 
When she that from the sun reaves power and light
Did but decline her beams as discontented
Converting sweetest days to saddest night
All droops all dies all trodden under dust
The person place and passages forgotten 
The hardest steel eaten with softest rust
The firm and solid tree both rent and rotten
Those thoughts so full of pleasure and content
That in our absence were affection food
Are razed out and from the fancy rent 
In highest grace and heart dear care that stood
Are cast for prey to hatred and to scorn —
Our dearest treasures and our heart true joys 
 The tokens hung on breast and kindly worn
Are now elsewhere disposed or held for toys
And those which then our jealousy removed
And others for our sakes then valued dear
The one forgot the rest are dear beloved
When all of ours doth strange or vild appear
Those streams seem standing puddles which before
We saw our beauties in so were they clear 
Belphoebe course is now observed no more 
That fair resemblance weareth out of date 
Our ocean seas are but tempestuous waves
And all things base that blessed were of late
And as a field wherein the stubble stands
Of harvest past the ploughman eye offends 
He tills again or tears them up with hands
And throws to fire as foiled and fruitless ends
And takes delight another seed to sow 
So doth the mind root up all wonted thought
And scorns the care of our remaining woes 
The sorrows which themselves for us have wrought
Are burnt to cinders by new kindled fires 
The ashes are dispersed into the air 
The sighs the groans of all our past desires
Are clean outworn as things that never were
With youth is dead the hope of love return
Who looks not back to hear our after-cries 
Where he is not he laughs at those that mourn 
Whence he is gone he scorns the mind that dies
When he is absent he believes no words 
When reason speaks he careless stops his ears 
Whom he hath left he never grace affords
But bathes his wings in our lamenting tears
Unlasting passion soon outworn conceit
Whereon I built and on so dureless trust 
My mind had wounds I dare not say deceit
Were I resolved her promise was not just
Sorrow was my revenge and woe my hate 
I powerless was to alter my desire 
My love is not of time or bound to date 
My heart internal heat and living fire
Would not or could be quenched with sudden showers 
My bound respect was not confined to days 
My vowed faith not set to ended hours 
I love the bearing and not bearing sprays
Which now to others do their sweetness send 
The incarnate snow-driven white and purest azure 
Who from high heaven doth on their fields descend
Filling their barns with grain and towers with treasure
Erring or never erring such is love
As while it lasteth scorns the account of those
Seeking but self-contentment to improve
And hides if any be his inward woes
And will not know while he knows his own passion
The often and unjust perseverance
 In deeds of love and state and every action
From that first day and yearof their joy entrance
But I unblessed and ill-born creature
That did embrace the dust her body bearing
That loved her both by fancy and by nature
That drew even with the milk in my first sucking
Affection from the parent breast that bare me
Have found her as a stranger so severe
Improving my mishap in each degree 
But love was gone so would I my life were 
A queen she was to me — no more Belphoebe 
A lion then — no more a milk-white dove 
A prisoner in her breast I could not be —
She did untie the gentle chains of love
Love was no more the love of hiding
All trespass and mischance for her own glory 
It had been such it was still for the elect 
But I must be the example in love story 
This was of all forepast the sad effect
But thou my weary soul and heavy thought
Made by her love a burthen to my being
Dost know my error never was forethought
Or ever could proceed from sense of loving
Of other cause if then it had proceeding
I leave the excuse sith judgment hath been given 
The limbs divided sundered and ableeding
Cannot complain the sentence was uneven
This did that nature wonder virtue choice
The only paragon of time begetting
Divine in words angelical in voice
That spring of joys that flower of love own setting
The idea remaining of those golden ages
That beauty braving heavens and earth embalming
Which after worthless worlds but play on stages
Such didst thou her long since describe yet sighing
That thy unable spirit could not find aught
In heaven beauties or in earth delight
For likeness fit to satisfy thy thought 
But what hath it availed thee so to write 
She cares not for thy praise who knows not theirs 
It now an idle labour and a tale
Told out of time that dulls the hearer ears 
A merchandize whereof there is no sale
Leave them or lay them up with thy despairs 
She hath resolved and judged thee long ago
Thy lines are now a murmuring to her ears
Like to a falling stream which passing slow
Is wont to nourish sleep and quietness 
So shall thy painful labours be perused
And draw on rest which sometime had regard 
But those her cares thy errors have excused
Thy days fordone have had their day reward 
So her hard heart so her estranged mind
In which above the heavens I once reposed 
So to thy error have her ears inclined
And have forgotten all thy past deserving
Holding in mind but only thine offence 
And only now afiecteth thy depraving
And thinks all vain that pleadeth thy defence
Yet greater fancy beauty never bred 
A more desire the heart-blood never nourished 
Her sweetness an affection never fed
Which more in any age hath ever flourished
The mind and virtue never have begotten
A firmer love since love on earth had power 
A love obscured but cannot be forgotten 
Too great and strong for time jaws to devour 
Containing such a faith as ages wound not
Care wakeful ever of her good estate
Fear dreading loss which sighs and joys not
A memory of the joys her grace begat 
A lasting gratefulness for those comforts past
Of which the cordial sweetness cannot die 
These thoughts knit up by faith shall ever last 
These time assays but never can untie
Whose life once lived in her pearl-like breast
Whose joys were drawn but from her happiness
Whose hearts high pleasure and whose mind's true rest
Proceeded from her fortune blessedness 
Who was intentive wakeful and dismayed
In fears in dreams in feverous jealousy
Who long in silence served and obeyed
With secret heart and hidden loyalty
Which never change to sad adversity
Which never age or nature overthrow
Which never sickness or deformity
Which never wasting care or wearing woe
If subject unto these she could have been —
Which never words or wits malicious
Which never honour bait or world s fame
Achieved by attempts adventurous
Or aught beneath the sun or heavens frame
Can so dissolve dissever or destroy
The essential love of no frail parts compounded
Though of the same now buried be the joy
The hope the comfort and the sweetness ended
But that the thoughts and memories of thfese
Work a relapse of passion and remain
Of mv sad heart the sorrow-suckmg bees 
The wrongs received the frowns persuade in vain
And though these medicines work desire to end
And are in others the true cure of liking
The salves that heal love wounds and do amend
Consuming woe and slake our hearty sighing
They work not so in thy mind long decease 
External fancy time alone recureth
All whose effects do wear away with ease
Love of delight while such delight endureth 
Stays by the pleasure but no longer stays 
But in my mind so is her love inclosed
And is thereof not only the best part
But into it the essence is disposed
Oh love the more my woe to it thou art
Even as the moisture in each plant that grows 
Even as the sun unto the frozen ground 
Even as the sweetness to the incarnate rose 
Even as the centre in each perfect round
As water to the fish to men as air
As heat to fire as light unto the sun 
Oh love it is but vain to say thou were 
Ages and times cannot thy power outrun
Thou art the soul of that unhappy mind
Which being by nature made an idle thought
Began even then to take immortal kind
When first her virtues in thy spirits wrought
From thee therefore that mover cannot move
Because it is become thy cause of being 
Whatever error may obscure that love
Whatever frail effect in mortal living
Whatever passion from distempered heart
What absence time or injuries effect
What faithless friends or deep dissembled art
Present to feed her most unkind suspect
Yet as the air in deep caves underground
Is strongly drawn when violent heat hath vent
Great clefts therein till moisture do abound
And then the same imprisoned and uppent
Breaks out in earthquakes tearing all asunder 
So in the centre of my cloven heart —
My heart to whom her beauties were such wonder —
Lies the sharp poisoned head of that love dart
Which till all break and all dissolve to dust
Thence drawn it cannot be or therein known 
There mixed with my heart-blood the fretting rust
The better part hath eaten and outgrown
But what of those or these or what of ought
Of that which was or that which is to treat 
What I possess is but the same I sought 
My love was false my labours were deceit
Nor less than such they are esteemed to be 
A fraud bought at the price of many woes 
A guile whereof the profits unto me —
Could it be thought premeditate for those 
Witness those withered leaves left on the tree
The sorrow-worn face the pensive mind 
The external shews what may the internal be 
Cold care hath bitten both the root and rind
But stay my thoughts make end give fortune way 
Harsh is the voice of woe and sorrow sound 
Complaints cure not and tears do but allay
Griefs for a time which after more abound
To seek for moisture in the Arabian sand
Is but a loss of labour and of rest 
The links which time did break of hearty bands
Words cannot knit or wailings make anew
Seek not the sun in clouds when it is set 
On highest mountains where those cedars grew
Against whose banks the troubled ocean beat
And were the marks to find thy hoped port
Into a soil far off themselves remove
On Sestus' shore Leander late resort
Hero hath left no lamp to guide her love
Thou lookest for light in vain and storms arise 
She sleeps thy death that erst thy danger sighed
To God I leave it who first gave it me
And I her gave and she returned again
As it was hers so let His mercies be
Of my last comforts the essential mean
But be it so or not the effects are past
Her love hath end my woe must ever last
My days' delights my spring-time joys fordone
Which in the dawn and rising sun of youth
Had their creation and were first begun
Do in the evening and the winter sad
Present my mind which takes my time account
The grief remaining of the joy it had
My times that then ran o'er themselves in these
And now run out in other happiness
Bring unto those new joys and new-born days
So could she not if she were not the sun
Which sees the birth and burial of all else
And holds that power with which she first begun
Leaving each withered body to be torn
By fortune and by times tempestuous
Which by her virtue once fair fruit have born 
Knowing she can renew and can create
Green from the ground and flowers even out of stone 
By virtue lasting over time and date
Leaving us only woe which like the moss
Having compassion of unburied bones
Cleaves to mischance and unrepaired loss

FROM fairest creatures we desire increase
That thereby beauty rose might never die
But as the riper should by time decease
His tender heir might bear his memory
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel
Making a famine where abundance lies
Thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
Thou that art now the world fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And tender churl makest waste in niggarding
Pity the world or else this glutton be
To eat the world due by the grave and thee

When forty winters shall beseige thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty field
Thy youth proud livery so gazed on now
Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise
How much more praise deserved thy beauty use
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse
Proving his beauty by succession thine
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold

Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his self-love to stop posterity
Thou art thy mother glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime
So thou through windows of thine age shall see
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
But if thou live remember'd not to be
Die single and thine image dies with thee

Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
Upon thyself thy beauty legacy
Nature bequest gives nothing but doth lend
And being frank she lends to those are free
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
For having traffic with thyself alone
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
What acceptable audit canst thou leave
Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee
Which used lives th' executor to be

Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel
For never-resting time leads summer on
To hideous winter and confounds him there
Sap check'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where
Then were not summer distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
Beauty effect with beauty were bereft
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet

Then let not winter ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer ere thou be distill'd
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
With beauty treasure ere it be self-kill'd
That use is not forbidden usury
Which happies those that pay the willing loan
That for thyself to breed another thee
Or ten times happier be it ten for one
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
Leaving thee living in posterity
Be not self-will'd for thou art much too fair
To be death conquest and make worms thine heir

Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head each under eye
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight
Serving with looks his sacred majesty
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill
Resembling strong youth in his middle age
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
Attending on his golden pilgrimage
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
The eyes 'fore duteous now converted are
From his low tract and look another way
So thou thyself out-going in thy noon
Unlook'd on diest unless thou get a son

Music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds
By unions married do offend thine ear
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
Mark how one string sweet husband to another
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
Whose speechless song being many seeming one
Sings this to thee 'thou single wilt prove none

Is it for fear to wet a widow eye
That thou consumest thyself in single life
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind
When every private widow well may keep
By children eyes her husband shape in mind
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
But beauty waste hath in the world an end
And kept unused the user so destroys it
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murderous shame commits

For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
Who for thyself art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
But that thou none lovest is most evident
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove
Make thee another self for love of me
That beauty still may live in thine or thee

As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest
In one of thine from that which thou departest
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
Without this folly age and cold decay
If all were minded so the times should cease
And threescore year would make the world away
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
Look whom she best endow'd she gave the more
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die

When I do count the clock that tells the time
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
When I behold the violet past prime
And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
And summer green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
Then of thy beauty do I question make
That thou among the wastes of time must go
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow
And nothing 'gainst Time scythe can make defence
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence

O that you were yourself but love you are
No longer yours than you yourself here live
Against this coming end you should prepare
And your sweet semblance to some other give
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination then you were
Yourself again after yourself decease
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winter day
And barren rage of death eternal cold
O none but unthrifts Dear my love you know
You had a father let your son say so

Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck
And yet methinks I have astronomy
But not to tell of good or evil luck
Of plagues of dearths or seasons' quality
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
And constant stars in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
Or else of thee this I prognosticate
Thy end is truth and beauty doom and date

When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
When I perceive that men as plants increase
Cheered and check'd even by the self-same sky
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
And wear their brave state out of memory
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night
And all in war with Time for love of you
As he takes from you I engraft you new

But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
And fortify yourself in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
Now stand you on the top of happy hours
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers
Much liker than your painted counterfeit
So should the lines of life that life repair
Which this Time pencil or my pupil pen
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men
To give away yourself keeps yourself still
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill

Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
And in fresh numbers number all your graces
The age to come would say 'This poet lies
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces
So should my papers yellow'd with their age
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue
And your true rights be term'd a poet rage
And stretched metre of an antique song
But were some child of yours alive that time
You should live twice in it and in my rhyme

Shall I compare thee to a summer day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summer lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or nature changing course untrimm'd
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou growest
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee

Devouring Time blunt thou the lion paws
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger jaws
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
To the wide world and all her fading sweets
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime
O carve not with thy hours my love fair brow
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty pattern to succeeding men
Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young

A woman face with Nature own hand painted
Hast thou the master-mistress of my passion
A woman gentle heart but not acquainted
With shifting change as is false women fashion
An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling
Much steals men eyes and women souls amazeth
And for a woman wert thou first created
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting
And by addition me of thee defeated
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
But since she prick'd thee out for women pleasure
Mine be thy love and thy love use their treasure

So is it not with me as with that Muse
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Making a couplement of proud compare
With sun and moon with earth and sea rich gems
With April first-born flowers and all things rare
That heaven air in this huge rondure hems
O' let me true in love but truly write
And then believe me my love is as fair
As any mother child though not so bright
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven air
Let them say more than like of hearsay well
I will not praise that purpose not to sell

My glass shall not persuade me I am old
So long as youth and thou are of one date
But when in thee time furrows I behold
Then look I death my days should expiate
For all that beauty that doth cover thee
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart
Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
How can I then be elder than thou art
O therefore love be of thyself so wary
As I not for myself but for thee will
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
Thou gavest me thine not to give back again

As an unperfect actor on the stage
Who with his fear is put besides his part
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
Whose strength abundance weakens his own heart
So I for fear of trust forget to say
The perfect ceremony of love rite
And in mine own love strength seem to decay
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love might
O let my books be then the eloquence
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
Who plead for love and look for recompense
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd
O learn to read what silent love hath writ
To hear with eyes belongs to love fine wit

Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
Thy beauty form in table of my heart
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held
And perspective it is the painter art
For through the painter must you see his skill
To find where your true image pictured lies
Which in my bosom shop is hanging still
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
Are windows to my breast where-through the sun
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
They draw but what they see know not the heart

Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun eye
And in themselves their pride lies buried
For at a frown they in their glory die
The painful warrior famoused for fight
After a thousand victories once foil'd
Is from the book of honour razed quite
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd
Then happy I that love and am beloved
Where I may not remove nor be removed

Lord of my love to whom in vassalage
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
To thee I send this written embassage
To witness duty not to show my wit
Duty so great which wit so poor as mine
May make seem bare in wanting words to show it
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
In thy soul thought all naked will bestow it
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me

Weary with toil I haste me to my bed
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired
But then begins a journey in my head
To work my mind when body work expired
For then my thoughts from far where I abide
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
Looking on darkness which the blind do see
Save that my soul imaginary sight
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
For thee and for myself no quiet find

How can I then return in happy plight
That am debarr'd the benefit of rest
When day oppression is not eased by night
But day by night and night by day oppress'd
And each though enemies to either reign
Do in consent shake hands to torture me
The one by toil the other to complain
How far I toil still farther off from thee
I tell the day to please them thou art bright
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
And night doth nightly make grief strength
seem stronger

When in disgrace with fortune and men eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featured like him like him with friends possess'd
Desiring this man art and that man scope
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
Haply I think on thee and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven gate
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings

When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
And with old woes new wail my dear time waste
Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
For precious friends hid in death dateless night
And weep afresh love long since cancell'd woe
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan
Which I new pay as if not paid before
But if the while I think on thee dear friend
All losses are restored and sorrows end

Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
Which I by lacking have supposed dead
And there reigns love and all love loving parts
And all those friends which I thought buried
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
As interest of the dead which now appear
But things removed that hidden in thee lie
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
Who all their parts of me to thee did give
That due of many now is thine alone
Their images I loved I view in thee
And thou all they hast all the all of me

If thou survive my well-contented day
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
Compare them with the bettering of the time
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
Exceeded by the height of happier men
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
'Had my friend Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
To march in ranks of better equipage
But since he died and poets better prove
Theirs for their style I'll read his for his love

Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye
Kissing with golden face the meadows green
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With all triumphant splendor on my brow
But out alack he was but one hour mine
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
Suns of the world may stain when heaven sun staineth

Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
And make me travel forth without my cloak
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
The offender sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offence cross
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds

No more be grieved at that which thou hast done
Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
All men make faults and even I in this
Authorizing thy trespass with compare
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense 
Thy adverse party is thy advocate 
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence
Such civil war is in my love and hate
That I an accessary needs must be
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me

Let me confess that we two must be twain
Although our undivided loves are one
So shall those blots that do with me remain
Without thy help by me be borne alone
In our two loves there is but one respect
Though in our lives a separable spite
Which though it alter not love sole effect
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love delight
I may not evermore acknowledge thee
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
Nor thou with public kindness honour me
Unless thou take that honour from thy name
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report

As a decrepit father takes delight
To see his active child do deeds of youth
So I made lame by fortune dearest spite
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
Or any of these all or all or more
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
I make my love engrafted to this store
So then I am not lame poor nor despised
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
That I in thy abundance am sufficed
And by a part of all thy glory live
Look what is best that best I wish in thee
This wish I have then ten times happy me

How can my Muse want subject to invent
While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
Thine own sweet argument too excellent
For every vulgar paper to rehearse
O give thyself the thanks if aught in me
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
For who so dumb that cannot write to thee
When thou thyself dost give invention light
Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
Eternal numbers to outlive long date
If my slight Muse do please these curious days
The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise

O how thy worth with manners may I sing
When thou art all the better part of me
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee
Even for this let us divided live
And our dear love lose name of single one
That by this separation I may give
That due to thee which thou deservest alone
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
To entertain the time with thoughts of love
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
And that thou teachest how to make one twain
By praising him here who doth hence remain

Take all my loves my love yea take them all
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before
No love my love that thou mayst true love call
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
Then if for my love thou my love receivest
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
But yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
Although thou steal thee all my poverty
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
To bear love wrong than hate known injury
Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes

Those petty wrongs that liberty commits
When I am sometime absent from thy heart
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits
For still temptation follows where thou art
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won
Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
And when a woman woos what woman son
Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed
Ay me but yet thou mightest my seat forbear
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
Who lead thee in their riot even there
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
Thine by thy beauty being false to me

That thou hast her it is not all my grief
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief
A loss in love that touches me more nearly
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye
Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
If I lose thee my loss is my love gain
And losing her my friend hath found that loss
Both find each other and I lose both twain
And both for my sake lay on me this cross
But here the joy my friend and I are one
Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone

When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
For all the day they view things unrespected
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
How would thy shadow form form happy show
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
All days are nights to see till I see thee
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me

If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
Injurious distance should not stop my way
For then despite of space I would be brought
From limits far remote where thou dost stay
No matter then although my foot did stand
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
As soon as think the place where he would be
But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
But that so much of earth and water wrought
I must attend time leisure with my moan
Receiving nought by elements so slow
But heavy tears badges of either woe

The other two slight air and purging fire
Are both with thee wherever I abide
The first my thought the other my desire
These present-absent with swift motion slide
For when these quicker elements are gone
In tender embassy of love to thee
My life being made of four with two alone
Sinks down to death oppress'd with melancholy
Until life composition be recured
By those swift messengers return'd from thee
Who even but now come back again assured
Of thy fair health recounting it to me
This told I joy but then no longer glad
I send them back again and straight grow sad

Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
How to divide the conquest of thy sight
Mine eye my heart thy picture sight would bar
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie 
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes 
But the defendant doth that plea deny
And says in him thy fair appearance lies
To 'cide this title is impanneled
A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
And by their verdict is determined
The clear eye moiety and the dear heart part
As thus mine eye due is thy outward part
And my heart right thy inward love of heart

Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
And each doth good turns now unto the other
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
With my love picture then my eye doth feast
And to the painted banquet bids my heart
Another time mine eye is my heart guest
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part
So either by thy picture or my love
Thyself away art resent still with me
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
And I am still with them and they with thee
Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
Awakes my heart to heart and eye delight

How careful was I when I took my way
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust
That to my use it might unused stay
From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
But thou to whom my jewels trifles are
Most worthy of comfort now my greatest grief
Thou best of dearest and mine only care
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief
Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest
Save where thou art not though I feel thou art
Within the gentle closure of my breast
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear

Against that time if ever that time come
When I shall see thee frown on my defects
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
Call'd to that audit by advised respects
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
When love converted from the thing it was
Shall reasons find of settled gravity 
Against that time do I ensconce me here
Within the knowledge of mine own desert
And this my hand against myself uprear
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
Since why to love I can allege no cause

How heavy do I journey on the way
When what I seek my weary travel end
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
The beast that bears me tired with my woe
Plods dully on to bear that weight in me
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
His rider loved not speed being made from thee
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
Which heavily he answers with a groan
More sharp to me than spurring to his side
For that same groan doth put this in my mind
My grief lies onward and my joy behind

Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed
From where thou art why should I haste me thence
Till I return of posting is no need
O what excuse will my poor beast then find
When swift extremity can seem but slow
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind
In winged speed no motion shall I know
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace
Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade
Since from thee going he went wilful-slow
Towards thee I'll run and give him leave to go

So am I as the rich whose blessed key
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure
The which he will not every hour survey
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
Since seldom coming in the long year set
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are
Or captain jewels in the carcanet
So is the time that keeps you as my chest
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
To make some special instant special blest
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
Being had to triumph being lack'd to hope

What is your substance whereof are you made
That millions of strange shadows on you tend
Since every one hath every one one shade
And you but one can every shadow lend
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you
On Helen cheek all art of beauty set
And you in Grecian tires are painted new
Speak of the spring and foison of the year
The one doth shadow of your beauty show
The other as your bounty doth appear
And you in every blessed shape we know
In all external grace you have some part
But you like none none you for constant heart

O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour which doth in it live
The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye
As the perfumed tincture of the roses
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
When summer breath their masked buds discloses
But for their virtue only is their show
They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade
Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
When that shall fade my verse distills your truth

Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time
When wasteful war shall statues overturn
And broils root out the work of masonry
Nor Mars his sword nor war quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory
'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom
So till the judgment that yourself arise
You live in this and dwell in lover eyes

Sweet love renew thy force be it not said
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd
To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might
So love be thou although to-day thou fill
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness
To-morrow see again and do not kill
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Come daily to the banks that when they see
Return of love more blest may be the view
Else call it winter which being full of care
Makes summer welcome thrice more wish'd more rare

Being your slave what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire
I have no precious time at all to spend
Nor services to do till you require
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be or your affairs suppose
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
Save where you are how happy you make those
So true a fool is love that in your will
Though you do any thing he thinks no ill

That god forbid that made me first your slave
I should in thought control your times of pleasure
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
O let me suffer being at your beck
The imprison'd absence of your liberty
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check
Without accusing you of injury
Be where you list your charter is so strong
That you yourself may privilege your time
To what you will to you it doth belong
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime
I am to wait though waiting so be hell
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well

If there be nothing new but that which is
Hath been before how are our brains beguiled
Which labouring for invention bear amiss
The second burden of a former child
O that record could with a backward look
Even of five hundred courses of the sun
Show me your image in some antique book
Since mind at first in character was done
That I might see what the old world could say
To this composed wonder of your frame
Whether we are mended or whether better they
Or whether revolution be the same
O sure I am the wits of former days
To subjects worse have given admiring praise

Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
So do our minutes hasten to their end
Each changing place with that which goes before
In sequent toil all forwards do contend
Nativity once in the main of light
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crown'd
Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beauty brow
Feeds on the rarities of nature truth
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand

Is it thy will thy image should keep open
My heavy eyelids to the weary night
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
So far from home into my deeds to pry
To find out shames and idle hours in me
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy
O no thy love though much is not so great
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
To play the watchman ever for thy sake
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
From me far off with others all too near

Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
And all my soul and all my every part
And for this sin there is no remedy
It is so grounded inward in my heart
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine
No shape so true no truth of such account
And for myself mine own worth do define
As I all other in all worths surmount
But when my glass shows me myself indeed
Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read
Self so self-loving were iniquity
'Tis thee myself that for myself I praise
Painting my age with beauty of thy days

Against my love shall be as I am now
With Time injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
Hath travell'd on to age steepy night
And all those beauties whereof now he king
Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight
Stealing away the treasure of his spring
For such a time do I now fortify
Against confounding age cruel knife
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet love beauty though my lover life
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
And they shall live and he in them still green

When I have seen by Time fell hand defaced
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
And the firm soil win of the watery main
Increasing store with loss and loss with store
When I have seen such interchange of state
Or state itself confounded to decay
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
That Time will come and take my love away
This thought is as a death which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose

Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
But sad mortality o'er-sways their power
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
Whose action is no stronger than a flower
O how shall summer honey breath hold out
Against the wreckful siege of battering days
When rocks impregnable are not so stout
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays
O fearful meditation where alack
Shall Time best jewel from Time chest lie hid
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
O none unless this miracle have might
That in black ink my love may still shine bright

Tired with all these for restful death I cry
As to behold desert a beggar born
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity
And purest faith unhappily forsworn
And guilded honour shamefully misplaced
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced
And strength by limping sway disabled
And art made tongue-tied by authority
And folly doctor-like controlling skill
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity
And captive good attending captain ill
Tired with all these from these would I be gone
Save that to die I leave my love alone

Ah wherefore with infection should he live
And with his presence grace impiety
That sin by him advantage should achieve
And lace itself with his society
Why should false painting imitate his cheek
And steal dead seeing of his living hue
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Roses of shadow since his rose is true
Why should he live now Nature bankrupt is
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins
For she hath no excheckr now but his
And proud of many lives upon his gains
O him she stores to show what wealth she had
In days long since before these last so bad

Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now
Before the bastard signs of fair were born
Or durst inhabit on a living brow
Before the golden tresses of the dead
The right of sepulchres were shorn away
To live a second life on second head
Ere beauty dead fleece made another gay
In him those holy antique hours are seen
Without all ornament itself and true
Making no summer of another green
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new
And him as for a map doth Nature store
To show false Art what beauty was of yore

Those parts of thee that the world eye doth view
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
In other accents do this praise confound
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
They look into the beauty of thy mind
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
The solve is this that thou dost common grow

That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
For slander mark was ever yet the fair
The ornament of beauty is suspect
A crow that flies in heaven sweetest air
So thou be good slander doth but approve
Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime
Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days
Either not assail'd or victor being charged
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
To tie up envy evermore enlarged
If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe

No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
Nay if you read this line remember not
The hand that writ it for I love you so
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
If thinking on me then should make you woe
O if I say you look upon this verse
When I perhaps compounded am with clay
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
But let your love even with my life decay
Lest the wise world should look into your moan
And mock you with me after I am gone

O lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me that you should love
After my death dear love forget me quite
For you in me can nothing worthy prove
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
To do more for me than mine own desert
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Than niggard truth would willingly impart
O lest your true love may seem false in this
That you for love speak well of me untrue
My name be buried where my body is
And live no more to shame nor me nor you
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
And so should you to love things nothing worth

That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
Bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west
Which by and by black night doth take away
Death second self that seals up all in rest
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
As the death-bed whereon it must expire
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by
This thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong
To love that well which thou must leave ere long

But be contented when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away
My life hath in this line some interest
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
When thou reviewest this thou dost review
The very part was consecrate to thee
The earth can have but earth which is his due
My spirit is thine the better part of me
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
The prey of worms my body being dead
The coward conquest of a wretch knife
Too base of thee to be remembered
The worth of that is that which it contains
And that is this and this with thee remains

So are you to my thoughts as food to life
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
Now counting best to be with you alone
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
And by and by clean starved for a look
Possessing or pursuing no delight
Save what is had or must from you be took
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
Or gluttoning on all or all away

Why is my verse so barren of new pride
So far from variation or quick change
Why with the time do I not glance aside
To new-found methods and to compounds strange
Why write I still all one ever the same
And keep invention in a noted weed
That every word doth almost tell my name
Showing their birth and where they did proceed
O know sweet love I always write of you
And you and love are still my argument
So all my best is dressing old words new
Spending again what is already spent
For as the sun is daily new and old
So is my love still telling what is told

Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
The vacant leaves thy mind imprint will bear
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
Thou by thy dial shady stealth mayst know
Time thievish progress to eternity
Look what thy memory can not contain
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
Those children nursed deliver'd from thy brain
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
These offices so oft as thou wilt look
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book

So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
And found such fair assistance in my verse
As every alien pen hath got my use
And under thee their poesy disperse
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
Have added feathers to the learned wing
And given grace a double majesty
Yet be most proud of that which I compile
Whose influence is thine and born of thee
In others' works thou dost but mend the style
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
But thou art all my art and dost advance
As high as learning my rude ignorance

Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd
And my sick Muse doth give another place
I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of and pays it thee again
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
From thy behavior beauty doth he give
And found it in thy cheek he can afford
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
Then thank him not for that which he doth say
Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay

O how I faint when I of you do write
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
And in the praise thereof spends all his might
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame
But since your worth wide as the ocean is
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
My saucy bark inferior far to his
On your broad main doth wilfully appear
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
Or being wreck'd I am a worthless boat
He of tall building and of goodly pride
Then if he thrive and I be cast away
The worst was this my love was my decay

Or I shall live your epitaph to make
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
From hence your memory death cannot take
Although in me each part will be forgotten
Your name from hence immortal life shall have
Though I once gone to all the world must die
The earth can yield me but a common grave
When you entombed in men eyes shall lie
Your monument shall be my gentle verse
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
When all the breathers of this world are dead
You still shall live such virtue hath my pen 
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men

I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject blessing every book
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days
And do so love yet when they have devised
What strained touches rhetoric can lend
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
In true plain words by thy true-telling friend
And their gross painting might be better used
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused

I never saw that you did painting need
And therefore to your fair no painting set
I found or thought I found you did exceed
The barren tender of a poet debt
And therefore have I slept in your report
That you yourself being extant well might show
How far a modern quill doth come too short
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
This silence for my sin you did impute
Which shall be most my glory being dumb
For I impair not beauty being mute
When others would give life and bring a tomb
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both your poets can in praise devise

Who is it that says most which can say more
Than this rich praise that you alone are you
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory
But he that writes of you if he can tell
That you are you so dignifies his story
Let him but copy what in you is writ
Not making worse what nature made so clear
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
Making his style admired every where
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse

My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still
While comments of your praise richly compiled
Reserve their character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words
And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen
To every hymn that able spirit affords
In polish'd form of well-refined pen
Hearing you praised I say ''Tis so 'tis true
And to the most of praise add something more
But that is in my thought whose love to you
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
Then others for the breath of words respect
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect

Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
Bound for the prize of all too precious you
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
No neither he nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid my verse astonished
He nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
As victors of my silence cannot boast
I was not sick of any fear from thence
But when your countenance fill'd up his line
Then lack'd I matter that enfeebled mine

Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
My bonds in thee are all determinate
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
And for that riches where is my deserving
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
And so my patent back again is swerving
Thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing
Or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking
So thy great gift upon misprision growing
Comes home again on better judgment making
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king but waking no such matter

When thou shalt be disposed to set me light
And place my merit in the eye of scorn
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight
And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
With mine own weakness being best acquainted
Upon thy part I can set down a story
Of faults conceal'd wherein I am attainted
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory
And I by this will be a gainer too
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
The injuries that to myself I do
Doing thee vantage double-vantage me
Such is my love to thee I so belong
That for thy right myself will bear all wrong

Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
And I will comment upon that offence
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt
Against thy reasons making no defence
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
To set a form upon desired change
As I'll myself disgrace knowing thy will
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
Lest I too much profane should do it wrong
And haply of our old acquaintance tell
For thee against myself I'll vow debate
For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate

Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
Join with the spite of fortune make me bow
And do not drop in for an after-loss
Ah do not when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
To linger out a purposed overthrow
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
When other petty griefs have done their spite
But in the onset come so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortune might
And other strains of woe which now seem woe
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so

Some glory in their birth some in their skill
Some in their wealth some in their bodies' force
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill
Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest
But these particulars are not my measure
All these I better in one general best
Thy love is better than high birth to me
Richer than wealth prouder than garments' cost
Of more delight than hawks or horses be
And having thee of all men pride I boast
Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
All this away and me most wretched make

But do thy worst to steal thyself away
For term of life thou art assured mine
And life no longer than thy love will stay
For it depends upon that love of thine
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs
When in the least of them my life hath end
I see a better state to me belongs
Than that which on thy humour doth depend
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
O what a happy title do I find
Happy to have thy love happy to die
But what so blessed-fair that fears no blot
Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not

So shall I live supposing thou art true
Like a deceived husband so love face
May still seem love to me though alter'd new
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
For there can live no hatred in thine eye
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
In many looks the false heart history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart workings be
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
How like Eve apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show

They that have power to hurt and will do none
That do not do the thing they most do show
Who moving others are themselves as stone
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
They rightly do inherit heaven graces
And husband nature riches from expense
They are the lords and owners of their faces
Others but stewards of their excellence
The summer flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die
But if that flower with base infection meet
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds

How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
That tongue that tells the story of thy days
Making lascivious comments on thy sport
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
Naming thy name blesses an ill report
O what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee
Where beauty veil doth cover every blot
And all things turn to fair that eyes can see
Take heed dear heart of this large privilege
The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge

Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less
Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort
As on the finger of a throned queen
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd
So are those errors that in thee are seen
To truths translated and for true things deem'd
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
If like a lamb he could his looks translate
How many gazers mightst thou lead away
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report

How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen
What old December bareness every where
And yet this time removed was summer time
The teeming autumn big with rich increase
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
And thou away the very birds are mute
Or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale dreading the winter near

From you have I been absent in the spring
When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Could make me any summer story tell
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
Nor did I wonder at the lily white
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
They were but sweet but figures of delight
Drawn after you you pattern of all those
Yet seem'd it winter still and you away
As with your shadow I with these did play

The forward violet thus did I chide
Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
If not from my love breath The purple pride
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
In my love veins thou hast too grossly dyed
The lily I condemned for thy hand
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand
One blushing shame another white despair
A third nor red nor white had stol'n of both
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath
But for his theft in pride of all his growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death
More flowers I noted yet I none could see
But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee

Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem
In gentle numbers time so idly spent
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument
Rise resty Muse my love sweet face survey
If Time have any wrinkle graven there
If any be a satire to decay
And make Time spoils despised every where
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life
So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife

O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
Both truth and beauty on my love depends
So dost thou too and therein dignified
Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say
'Truth needs no colour with his colour fix'd
Beauty no pencil beauty truth to lay
But best is best if never intermix'd
Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
Excuse not silence so for't lies in thee
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
And to be praised of ages yet to be
Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how
To make him seem long hence as he shows now

My love is strengthen'd though more weak in seeming
I love not less though less the show appear
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
The owner tongue doth publish every where
Our love was new and then but in the spring
When I was wont to greet it with my lays
As Philomel in summer front doth sing
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
But that wild music burthens every bough
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
Because I would not dull you with my song

Alack what poverty my Muse brings forth
That having such a scope to show her pride
The argument all bare is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside
O blame me not if I no more can write
Look in your glass and there appears a face
That over-goes my blunt invention quite
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
Were it not sinful then striving to mend
To mar the subject that before was well
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
And more much more than in my verse can sit
Your own glass shows you when you look in it

To me fair friend you never can be old
For as you were when first your eye I eyed
Such seems your beauty still Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
In process of the seasons have I seen
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
Ah yet doth beauty like a dial-hand
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
Ere you were born was beauty summer dead

Let not my love be call'd idolatry
Nor my beloved as an idol show
Since all alike my songs and praises be
To one of one still such and ever so
Kind is my love to-day to-morrow kind
Still constant in a wondrous excellence
Therefore my verse to constancy confined
One thing expressing leaves out difference
'Fair kind and true' is all my argument
'Fair kind and true' varying to other words
And in this change is my invention spent
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
'Fair kind and true' have often lived alone
Which three till now never kept seat in one

When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty best
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
I see their antique pen would have express'd
Even such a beauty as you master now
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time all you prefiguring
And for they look'd but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
For we which now behold these present days
Had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise

Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
And the sad augurs mock their own presage
Incertainties now crown themselves assured
And peace proclaims olives of endless age
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
And thou in this shalt find thy monument
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent

What in the brain that ink may character
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
What new to speak what new to register
That may express my love or thy dear merit
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
I must each day say o'er the very same
Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name
So that eternal love in love fresh case
Weighs not the dust and injury of age
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
But makes antiquity for aye his page
Finding the first conceit of love there bred
Where time and outward form would show it dead

O never say that I was false of heart
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
That is my home of love if I have ranged
Like him that travels I return again
Just to the time not with the time exchanged
So that myself bring water for my stain
Never believe though in my nature reign'd
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
That it could so preposterously be stain'd
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
For nothing this wide universe I call
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all

Alas 'tis true I have gone here and there
And made myself a motley to the view
Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
Made old offences of affections new
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
Askance and strangely but by all above
These blenches gave my heart another youth
And worse essays proved thee my best of love
Now all is done have what shall have no end
Mine appetite I never more will grind
On newer proof to try an older friend
A god in love to whom I am confined
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast

O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
And almost thence my nature is subdued
To what it works in like the dyer hand
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
No bitterness that I will bitter think
Nor double penance to correct correction
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me

Your love and pity doth the impression fill
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow
For what care I who calls me well or ill
So you o'er-green my bad my good allow
You are my all the world and I must strive
To know my shames and praises from your tongue
None else to me nor I to none alive
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong
In so profound abysm I throw all care
Of others' voices that my adder sense
To critic and to flatterer stopped are
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
You are so strongly in my purpose bred
That all the world besides methinks are dead

Since I left you mine eye is in my mind
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function and is partly blind
Seems seeing but effectually is out
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
The mountain or the sea the day or night
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
Incapable of more replete with you
My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue

Or whether doth my mind being crown'd with you
Drink up the monarch plague this flattery
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true
And that your love taught it this alchemy
To make of monsters and things indigest
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
Creating every bad a perfect best
As fast as objects to his beams assemble
O'tis the first 'tis flattery in my seeing
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing
And to his palate doth prepare the cup
If it be poison'd 'tis the lesser sin
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin

Those lines that I before have writ do lie
Even those that said I could not love you dearer
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
But reckoning time whose million'd accidents
Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings
Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things
Alas why fearing of time tyranny
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best
When I was certain o'er incertainty
Crowning the present doubting of the rest
Love is a babe then might I not say so
To give full growth to that which still doth grow

Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandering bark
Whose worth unknown although his height be taken
Love not Time fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ nor no man ever loved

Accuse me thus that I have scanted all
Wherein I should your great deserts repay
Forgot upon your dearest love to call
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
That I have frequent been with unknown minds
And given to time your own dear-purchased right
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Which should transport me farthest from your sight
Book both my wilfulness and errors down
And on just proof surmise accumulate
Bring me within the level of your frown
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
The constancy and virtue of your love

Like as to make our appetites more keen
With eager compounds we our palate urge
As to prevent our maladies unseen
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge
Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
To be diseased ere that there was true needing
Thus policy in love to anticipate
The ills that were not grew to faults assured
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
But thence I learn and find the lesson true
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you

What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
Still losing when I saw myself to win
What wretched errors hath my heart committed
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
In the distraction of this madding fever
O benefit of ill now I find true
That better is by evil still made better
And ruin'd love when it is built anew
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
So I return rebuked to my content
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent

That you were once unkind befriends me now
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
As I by yours you've pass'd a hell of time
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime
O that our night of woe might have remember'd
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
And soon to you as you to me then tender'd
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
But that your trespass now becomes a fee
Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me

'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd
When not to be receives reproach of being
And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing
For why should others false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies
Which in their wills count bad what I think good
No I am that I am and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
Unless this general evil they maintain
All men are bad and in their badness reign

Thy gift thy tables are within my brain
Full character'd with lasting memory
Which shall above that idle rank remain
Beyond all date even to eternity
Or at the least so long as brain and heart
Have faculty by nature to subsist
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
Of thee thy record never can be miss'd
That poor retention could not so much hold
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
Therefore to give them from me was I bold
To trust those tables that receive thee more
To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Were to import forgetfulness in me

No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel nothing strange
They are but dressings of a former sight
Our dates are brief and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told
Thy registers and thee I both defy
Not wondering at the present nor the past
For thy records and what we see doth lie
Made more or less by thy continual haste
This I do vow and this shall ever be
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee

If my dear love were but the child of state
It might for Fortune bastard be unfather'd
As subject to Time love or to Time hate
Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gather'd
No it was builded far from accident
It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
Under the blow of thralled discontent
Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls
It fears not policy that heretic
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours
But all alone stands hugely politic
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
To this I witness call the fools of time
Which die for goodness who have lived for crime

Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy
With my extern the outward honouring
Or laid great bases for eternity
Which prove more short than waste or ruining
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Lose all and more by paying too much rent
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
No let me be obsequious in thy heart
And take thou my oblation poor but free
Which is not mix'd with seconds knows no art
But mutual render only me for thee
Hence thou suborn'd informer a true soul
When most impeach'd stands least in thy control

O thou my lovely boy who in thy power
Dost hold Time fickle glass his sickle hour
Who hast by waning grown and therein show'st
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure
She may detain but not still keep her treasure
Her audit though delay'd answer'd must be
And her quietus is to render thee

In the old age black was not counted fair
Or if it were it bore not beauty name
But now is black beauty successive heir
And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame
For since each hand hath put on nature power
Fairing the foul with art false borrow'd face
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
But is profaned if not lives in disgrace
Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
At such who not born fair no beauty lack
Slandering creation with a false esteem
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
That every tongue says beauty should look so

How oft when thou my music music play'st
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
At the wood boldness by thee blushing stand
To be so tickled they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
Making dead wood more blest than living lips
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss

The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action and till action lust
Is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallow'd bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
Had having and in quest to have extreme
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell

My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun
Coral is far more red than her lips' red
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
I have seen roses damask'd red and white
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
I love to hear her speak yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
I grant I never saw a goddess go
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare

Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
To say they err I dare not be so bold
Although I swear it to myself alone
And to be sure that is not false I swear
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
One on another neck do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgment place
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
And thence this slander as I think proceeds

Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain
Have put on black and loving mourners be
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
And suit thy pity like in every part
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack

Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
Is't not enough to torture me alone
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd
Of him myself and thee I am forsaken
A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom ward
But then my friend heart let my poor heart bail
Whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
Perforce am thine and all that is in me

So now I have confess'd that he is thine
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will
Myself I'll forfeit so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
For thou art covetous and he is kind
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole and yet am I not free

Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy 'Will
And 'Will' to boot and 'Will' in overplus
More than enough am I that vex thee still
To thy sweet will making addition thus
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
Shall will in others seem right gracious
And in my will no fair acceptance shine
The sea all water yet receives rain still
And in abundance addeth to his store
So thou being rich in 'Will' add to thy 'Will
One will of mine to make thy large 'Will' more
Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
Think all but one and me in that one 'Will

If thy soul check thee that I come so near
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will
And will thy soul knows is admitted there
Thus far for love my love-suit sweet fulfil
'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Among a number one is reckon'd none
Then in the number let me pass untold
Though in thy stores' account I one must be
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
Make but my name thy love and love that still
And then thou lovest me for my name is 'Will

Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see
They know what beauty is see where it lies
Yet what the best is take the worst to be
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide world common place
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred
And to this false plague are they now transferr'd

When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutor'd youth
Unlearned in the world false subtleties
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Although she knows my days are past the best
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd
But wherefore says she not she is unjust
And wherefore say not I that I am old
O love best habit is in seeming trust
And age in love loves not to have years told
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be

O call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Use power with power and slay me not by art
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
And therefore from my face she turns my foes
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Yet do not so but since I am near slain
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain

Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
The manner of my pity-wanting pain
If I might teach thee wit better it were
Though not to love yet love to tell me so
As testy sick men when their deaths be near
No news but health from their physicians know
For if I should despair I should grow mad
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
That I may not be so nor thou belied
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide

In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
For they in thee a thousand errors note
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue tune delighted
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone
Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
Only my plague thus far I count my gain
That she that makes me sin awards me pain

Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
O but with mine compare thou thine own state
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
Or if it do not from those lips of thine
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovest those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
By self-example mayst thou be denied

Lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
One of her feather'd creatures broke away
Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face
Not prizing her poor infant discontent
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
And play the mother part kiss me be kind
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will
If thou turn back and my loud crying still

Two loves I have of comfort and despair
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The better angel is a man right fair
The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill
To win me soon to hell my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
Wooing his purity with her foul pride
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
Suspect I may but not directly tell
But being both from me both to each friend
I guess one angel in another hell
Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out

Those lips that Love own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate
To me that languish'd for her sake
But when she saw my woeful state
Straight in her heart did mercy come
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom
And taught it thus anew to greet
'I hate' she alter'd with an end
That follow'd it as gentle day
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away
'I hate' from hate away she threw
And saved my life saying 'not you

Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
 these rebel powers that thee array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge is this thy body end
Then soul live thou upon thy servant loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shalt thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead there no more dying then

My love is as a fever longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
The uncertain sickly appetite to please
My reason the physician to my love
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
Hath left me and I desperate now approve
Desire is death which physic did except
Past cure I am now reason is past care
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen are
At random from the truth vainly express'd
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
Who art as black as hell as dark as night

O me what eyes hath Love put in my head
Which have no correspondence with true sight
Or if they have where is my judgment fled
That censures falsely what they see aright
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
What means the world to say it is not so
If it be not then love doth well denote
Love eye is not so true as all men 'No
How can it O how can Love eye be true
That is so vex'd with watching and with tears
No marvel then though I mistake my view
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears
O cunning Love with tears thou keep'st me blind
Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find

Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
Am of myself all tyrant for thy sake
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon
Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan
What merit do I in myself respect
That is so proud thy service to despise
When all my best doth worship thy defect
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
But love hate on for now I know thy mind
Those that can see thou lovest and I am blind

O from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway
To make me give the lie to my true sight
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantize of skill
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate
O though I love what others do abhor
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
If thy unworthiness raised love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee

Love is too young to know what conscience is
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
For thou betraying me I do betray
My nobler part to my gross body treason
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love flesh stays no father reason
But rising at thy name doth point out thee
As his triumphant prize Proud of this pride
He is contented thy poor drudge to be
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
No want of conscience hold it that I call
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall

In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn
In vowing new hate after new love bearing
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee
When I break twenty I am perjured most
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
And all my honest faith in thee is lost
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
Or made them swear against the thing they see
For I have sworn thee fair more perjured eye
To swear against the truth so foul a lie

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
A maid of Dian this advantage found
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat still to endure
And grew a seething bath which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
But at my mistress' eye Love brand new-fired
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
I sick withal the help of bath desired
And thither hied a sad distemper'd guest
But found no cure the bath for my help lies
Where Cupid got new fire my mistress' eyes

The little Love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd
This brand she quenched in a cool well by
Which from Love fire took heat perpetual
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased but I my mistress' thrall
Came there for cure and this by that I prove
Love fire heats water water cools not love
Not at first sight nor with a dribbed shot
Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed
But known worth did in mine of time proceed
Till by degrees it had full conquest got
I saw and liked I liked but loved not
I lov’d but straight did not what Love decreed
At length to love decrees I forc’d agreed
Yet with repining at so partial lot
Now even that footstep of lost liberty
Is gone and now like slave-born Muscovite
I call it praise to suffer tyranny
And now employ the remnant of my wit
To make myself believe that all is well
While with a feeling skill I paint my hell
Let dainty wits cry on the Sisters nine
That bravely mask’d their fancies may be told
Or Pindar apes flaunt they in phrases fine
Enam’ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold
Or else let them in statelier glory shine
Ennobling new found tropes with problems old
Or with strange similes enrich each line
Of herbs or beasts which Inde or Afric’ hold
For me in sooth no Muse but one I know
Phrases and problems from my reach do grow
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites
How then Even thus in Stella face I read
What love and beauty be then all my deed
But copying is what in her Nature writes
Virtue alas now let me take some rest
Thou set’st a bate between my will and wit
If vain love have my simple soul oppress’d
Leave what thou likest not deal not thou with it
Thy scepter use in some old Cato breast
Churches or schools are for thy seat more fit
I do confess pardon a fault confess’d
My mouth too tender is for thy hard bit
But if that needs thou wilt usurping be
The little reason that is left in me
And still th’effect of thy persuasions prove
I swear my heart such one shall show to thee
That shrines in flesh so true a deity
That Virtue thou thyself shalt be in love
It is most true that eyes are form’d to serve
The inward light and that the heavenly part
Ought to be king from whose rules who do swerve
Rebels to Nature strive for their own smart
It is most true what we call Cupid dart
An image is which for ourselves we carve
And fools adore in temple of our heart
Till that good God make Church and churchman starve
True that true beauty virtue is indeed
Whereof this beauty can be but a shade
Which elements with mortal mixture breed
True that on earth we are but pilgrims made
And should in soul up to our country move
True and yet true that I must Stella love
When Nature made her chief work Stella eyes
In colour black why wrapp’d she beams so bright
Would she in beamy black like painter wise
Frame daintiest lustre mix’d of shades and light
Or did she else that sober hue devise
In object best to knit and strength our sight
Lest if no veil those brave gleams did disguise
They sun-like should more dazzle than delight
Or would she her miraculous power show
That whereas black seems Beauty contrary
She even in black doth make all beauties flow
Both so and thus she minding Love should be
Placed ever there gave him this mourning weed
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed
Queen Virtue court which some call Stella face
Prepar’d by Nature choicest furniture
Hath his front built of alabaster pure
Gold in the covering of that stately place
The door by which sometimes comes forth her Grace
Red porphyr is which lock of pearl makes sure
Whose porches rich which name of cheeks endure
Marble mix’d red and white do interlace
The windows now through which this heav’nly guest
Looks o’er the world and can find nothing such
Which dare claim from those lights the name of best
Of touch they are that without touch doth touch
Which Cupid self from Beauty mine did draw
Of touch they are and poor I am their straw
Reason in faith thou art well serv’d that still
Wouldst brabbling be with sense and love in me
I rather wish’d thee climb the Muses’ hill
Or reach the fruit of Nature choicest tree
Or seek heav’n course or heav’n inside to see
Why shouldst thou toil our thorny soil to till
Leave sense and those which sense objects be
Deal thou with powers of thoughts leave love to will
But thou wouldst needs fight both with love and sense
With sword of wit giving wounds of dispraise
Till downright blows did foil thy cunning fence
For soon as they strake thee with Stella rays
Reason thou kneel’dst and offeredst straight to prove
By reason good good reason her to love
In truth oh Love with what a boyish kind
Thou doest proceed in thy most serious ways
That when the heav’n to thee his best displays
Yet of that best thou leav’st the best behind
For like a child that some fair book doth find
With gilded leaves or coloured vellum plays
Or at the most on some fine picture stays
But never heeds the fruit of writer mind
So when thou saw’st in Nature cabinet
Stella thou straight look’st babies in her eyes
In her cheek pit thou didst thy pitfold set
And in her breast bo-peep or couching lies
Playing and shining in each outward part
But fool seek’st not to get into her heart
Cupid because thou shin’st in Stella eyes
That from her locks thy day-nets none ‘scapes free
That those lips swell so full of thee they be
That her sweet breath makes oft thy flames to rise
That in her breast thy pap well sugared lies
That her Grace gracious makes thy wrongs that she
What words so ere she speak persuades for thee
That her clear voice lifts thy fame to the skies
Thou countest Stella thine like those whose powers
Having got up a breach by fighting well
Cry “Victory this fair day all is ours”
Oh no her heart is such a citadel
So fortified with wit stored with disdain
That to win it is all the skill and pain
Phoebus was judge between Jove Mars and Love
Of those three gods whose arms the fairest were
Jove golden shield did eagle sables bear
Whose talons held young Ganymede above
But in vert field Mars bare a golden spear
Which through a bleeding heart his point did shove
Each had his crest Mars carried Venus’ glove
Jove in his helm the thunderbolt did rear
Cupid them smiles for on his crest there lies
Stella fair hair her face he makes his shield
Where roses gules are borne in silver field
Phoebus drew wide the curtains of the skies
To blaze these last and sware devoutly then
The first thus match’d were scantly gentlemen
Alas have I not pain enough my friend
Upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire
Than did on him who first stole down the fire
While Love on me doth all his quiver spend
But with your rhubarb words you must contend
To grieve me worse in saying that desire
Doth plunge my well-form’d soul even in the mire
Of sinful thoughts which do in ruin end
If that be sin which doth the manners frame
Well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed
Ready of wit and fearing nought but shame
If that be sin which in fix’d hearts doth breed
A loathing of all loose unchastity
Then love is sin and let me sinful be
You that do search for every purling spring
Which from the ribs of old Parnassus flows
And every flower not sweet perhaps which grows
Near thereabouts into your poesy wring
You that do dictionary method bring
Into your rimes running in rattling rows
You that poor Petrarch long-deceased woes
With new-born sighs and denizen’d wit do sing
You take wrong ways those far-fet helps be such
As do bewray a want of inward touch
And sure at length stol’n goods do come to light
But if both for your love and skill your name
You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame
Stella behold and then begin to endite
In nature apt to like when I did see
Beauties which were of many carats fine
My boiling sprites did thither soon incline
And Love I thought that I was full of thee
But finding not those restless flames in me
Which others said did make their souls to pine
I thought those babes of some pin hurt did whine
By my love judging what love pain might be
But while I thus with this young lion played
Mine eyes shall I say curst or blest beheld
Stella now she is nam’d need more be said
In her sight I a lesson new have spell’d
I now have learn’d Love right and learn’d even so
As who by being poisoned doth poison know
His mother dear Cupid offended late
Because that Mars grown slacker in her love
With pricking shot he did not throughly more
To keep the pace of their first loving state
The boy refus’d for fear of Mars hate
Who threaten’d stripes if he his wrath did prove
But she in chafe him from her lap did shove
Brake bow brake shafts while Cupid weeping sate
Till that his grandame Nature pitying it
Of Stella brows make him two better bows
And in her eyes of arrows infinite
Oh how for joy he leaps oh how he crows
And straight therewith like wags new got to play
Falls to shrewd turns and I was in his way
With what sharp checks I in myself am shent
When into Reason audit I do go
And by just counts myself a bankrupt know
Of all the goods which heav’n to me hath lent
Unable quite to pay even Nature rent
Which unto it by birthright I do owe
And which is worse no good excuse can show
But that my wealth I have most idly spent
My youth doth waste my knowledge brings forth toys
My wit doth strive those passions to defend
Which for reward spoil it with vain annoys
I see my course to lose myself doth bend
I see and yet no greater sorrow take
Than that I lose no more for Stella sake
On Cupid bow how are my heartstrings bent
That see my wrack and yet embrace the same
When most I glory then I feel most shame
I willing run yet while I run repent
My best wits still their own disgrace invent
My very ink turns straight to Stella name
And yet my words as them my pen doth frame
Avise themselves that they are vainly spent
For though she pass all things yet what is all
That unto me who fare like him that both
Looks to the skies and in a ditch doth fall
Oh let me prop my mind yet in his growth
And not in Nature for best fruits unfit
“Scholar” saith Love “bend hitherward your wit”
Fly fly my friends I have my death wound fly
See there that boy that murd’ring boy I say
Who like a thief hid in dark bush doth lie
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey
So tyrant he no fitter place could spy
Nor so fair level in so secret stay
As that sweet black which veils the heav’nly eye
There himself with his shot he close doth lay
Poor passenger pass now thereby I did
And stayed pleas’d with the prospect of the place
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid
But straight I saw motions of lightning grace
And then descried the glist’ring of his dart
But ere I could fly hence it pierc’d my heart
Your words my friend right healthful caustics blame
My young mind marr’d whom Love doth windlass so
That mine own writings like bad servants show
My wits quick in vain thoughts in virtue lame
That Plato I read for nought but if he tame
Such doltish gyres that to my birth I owe
Nobler desires lest else that friendly foe
Great Expectation were a train of shame
For since mad March great promise made of me
If now the May of my years much decline
What can be hoped my harvest time will be
Sure you say well “Your wisdom golden mine
Dig deep with learning spade” Now tell me this
Hath this world aught so fair as Stella is
In highest way of heav’n the Sun did ride
Progressing then from fair twins’ golden place
Having no scarf of clouds before his face
But shining forth of heat in his chief pride
When some fair ladies by hard promise tied
On horseback met him in his furious race
Yet each prepar’d with fan well-shading grace
From that foe wounds their tender skins to hide
Stella alone with face unarmed march’d
Either to do like him which open shone
Or careless of the wealth because her own
Yet were the hid and meaner beauties parch’d
Her daintiest bare went free the cause was this
The Sun which others burn’d did her but kiss
The curious wits seeing dull pensiveness
Bewray itself in my long settled eyes
Whence those same fumes of melancholy rise
With idle pains and missing aim do guess
Some that know how my spring I did address
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies
Others because the Prince my service tries
Think that I think state errors to redress
But harder judges judge ambition rage
Scourge of itself still climbing slipp’ry place
Holds my young brain captiv’d in golden cage
Oh Fools or over-wise alas the race
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start
But only Stella eyes and Stella heart
Rich fools there be whose base and filthy heart
Lies hatching still the goods wherein they flow
And damning their own selves to Tantal smart
Wealth breeding want more blest more wretched grow
Yet to those fools heav’n such wit doth impart
As what their hands do hold their heads do know
And knowing love and loving lay apart
As sacred things far from all danger show
But that rich fool who by blind Fortune lot
The richest gem of love and life enjoys
And can with foul abuse such beauties blot
Let him depriv’d of sweet but unfelt joys
Exil’d for aye from those high treasures which
He knows not grow in only folly rich
The wisest scholar of the wight most wise
By Phoebus’ doom with sugar’d sentence says
That Virtue if it once met with our eyes
Strange flames of love it in our souls would raise
But for that man with pain his truth descries
Whiles he each thing in sense balance weighs
And so nor will nor can behold those skies
Which inward sun to heroic mind displays
Virtue of late with virtuous care to stir
Love of herself took Stella shape that she
To mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her
It is most true for since I her did see
Virtue great beauty in that face I prove
And find th’effect for I do burn in love
Though dusty wits dare scorn astrology
And fools can think those lamps of purest light
Whose numbers ways greatness eternity
Promising wonders wonder do invite
To have for no cause birthright in the sky
But for to spangle the black weeds of night
Or for some brawl which in that chamber high
They should still dance to please a gazer sight
For me I do Nature un-idle know
And know great causes great effects procure
And know those bodies high reign on the low
And if these rules did fail proof makes me sure
Who oft fore-judge my after-following race
By only those two stars in Stella face

Lo I the man whose Muse whilome did maske
As time her taught in lowly Shepheards weeds
Am now enforst a far unfitter taske
For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds 
Whose prayses having slept in silence long
Me all too meane the sacred Muse areeds
To blazon broade emongst her learned throng

Helpe then O holy Virgin chiefe of nine 
Thy weaker Novice to performe thy will
Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne
The antique rolles which there lye hidden still
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long 
Sought through the world and suffered so much ill
That I must rue his undeserved wrong

And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove
Faire Venus sonne that with thy cruell dart 
At that good knight so cunningly didst rove
That glorious fire it kindled in his hart
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart
And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde
Come both and with you bring triumphant Mart 
In loves and gentle jollities arrayd

And with them eke O Goddesse heavenly bright
Mirrour of grace and Majestie divine
Great Lady of the greatest Isle whose light 
Like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne
And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile
To thinke of that true glorious type of thine
The argument of mine afflicted stile 

A GENTLE Knight was pricking on the plaine
Ycladd in mightie armes and silver shielde
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine
The cruel markes of many'a bloudy fielde
Yet armes till that time did he never wield 
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield
Full jolly knight he seemd and faire did sitt

And on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore 
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore
And dead as living ever him ador'd
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd
For soveraine hope which in his helpe he had 
Right faithfull true he was in deede and word
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad

Upon a great adventure he was bond
That greatest Gloriana to him gave 
That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond
To winne him worship and her grace to have
Which of all earthly things he most did crave
And ever as he rode his hart did earne
To prove his puissance in battell brave 
Upon his foe and his new force to learne

A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside
Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow
Yet she much whiter but the same did hide 
Under a vele that wimpled was full low
And over all a blacke stole she did throw
As one that inly mournd so was she sad
And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had 

So pure and innocent as that same lambe
She was in life and every vertuous lore
And by descent from Royall lynage came
Of ancient Kings and Queenes that had of yore 
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore
And all the world in their subjection held
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore
Forwasted all their land and them expeld

Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag
That lasie seemd in being ever last
Or wearied with bearing of her bag
Of needments at his backe Thus as they past
The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast 
And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine
Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast
That everie wight to shrowd it did constrain

Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand 
A shadie grove not far away they spide
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride
Did spred so broad that heavens light did hide
Not perceable with power of any starre 
And all within were pathes and alleies wide
With footing worne and leading inward farre

And foorth they passe with pleasure forward led
Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony 
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy
The sayling Pine the Cedar proud and tall
The vine-prop Elme the Poplar never dry 
The builder Oake sole king of forrests all

The Laurell meed of mightie Conquerours
And Poets sage the firre that weepeth still
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours 
The Eugh obedient to the benders will
The Birch for shaftes the Sallow for the mill
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound
The warlike Beech the Ash for nothing ill
The fruitfull Olive and the Platane round 

Led with delight they thus beguile the way
Untill the blustring storme is overblowne
When weening to returne whence they did stray
They cannot finde that path which first was showne 
But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne
Furthest from end then when they neerest weene
That makes them doubt their wits be not their owne
So many pathes so many turnings seene

At last resolving forward still to fare
Till that some end they finde or in or out
That path they take that beaten seemd most bare
And like to lead the labyrinth about
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout 
At length it brought them to a hollow cave
Amid the thickest woods The Champion stout
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave

Be well aware quoth then that Ladie milde 
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke
The danger hid the place unknowne and wilde
Breedes dreadfull doubts Oft fire is without smoke
And perill without show therefore your stroke
Sir Knight with-hold till further triall made 
Ah Ladie said he shame were to revoke
The forward footing for an hidden shade

Yea but quoth she the perill of this place
I better wot then you though now too late 
To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace
Yet wisedome warnes whilest foot is in the gate
To stay the steppe ere forced to retrate
This is the wandring wood this Errours den
A monster vile whom God and man does hate 
Therefore I read beware Fly fly quoth then

But full of fire and greedy hardiment
The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide
But forth unto the darksome hole he went 
And looked in his glistring armor made
A litle glooming light much like a shade
By which he saw the ugly monster plaine
Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide
But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine 

And as she lay upon the durtie ground
Her huge long taile her den all overspred
Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound
Pointed with mortall sting Of her there bred 
A thousand yong ones which she dayly fed
Sucking upon her poisnous dugs eachone
Of sundry shapes yet all ill favored
Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone

Their dam upstart out of her den effraide
And rushed forth hurling her hideous taile
About her cursed head whose folds displaid
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile
She lookt about and seeing one in mayle 
Armed to point sought backe to turne againe
For light she hated as the deadly bale
Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine

Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd he lept 
As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept
From turning backe and forced her to stay
Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray
And turning fierce her speckled taile advaunst 
Threatning her angry sting him to dismay
Who nought aghast his mightie hand enhaunst

Much daunted with that dint her sence was dazd
Yet kindling rage her selfe she gathered round 
And all attonce her beastly body raizd
With doubled forces high above the ground
Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd
Lept fierce upon his shield and her huge traine
All suddenly about his body wound 
That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine

His Lady sad to see his sore constraint
Cride out Now now Sir knight shew what ye bee
Add faith unto your force and be not faint 
Strangle her else she sure will strangle thee
That when he heard in great perplexitie
His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine
And knitting all his force got one hand free
Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine 

Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw
A floud of poyson horrible and blacke
Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw
Which stunck so vildly that it forst him slacke 
His grasping hold and from her turne him backe
Her vomit full of bookes and papers was
With loathly frogs and toades which eyes did lacke
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras

As when old father Nilus gins to swell
With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale
His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale
But when his later spring gins to avale 
Huge heapes of mudd he leaves wherein there breed
Ten thousand kindes of creatures partly male
And partly female of his fruitful seed

The same so sore annoyed has the knight 
That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke
His forces faile ne can no lenger fight
Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke
Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small 
Deformed monsters fowle and blacke as inke
With swarming all about his legs did crall

As gentle Shepheard in sweete even-tide
When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west 
High on an hill his flocke to vewen wide
Markes which do byte their hasty supper best
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest
All striving to infixe their feeble stings
That from their noyance he no where can rest 
But with his clownish hands their tender wings

Thus ill bestedd and fearefull more of shame
Then of the certeine perill he stood in
Halfe furious unto his foe he came 
Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win
Or soone to lose before he once would lin
And strooke at her with more then manly force
That from her body full of filthie sin
He raft her hatefull head without remorse 

Her scattred brood soone as their Parent deare
They saw so rudely falling to the ground
Groning full deadly all with troublous feare
Gathred themselves about her body round 
Weening their wonted entrance to have found
At her wide mouth but being there withstood
They flocked all about her bleeding wound
And sucked up their dying mothers blood

That detestable sight him much amazde
To see th' unkindly Impes of heaven accurst
Devoure their dam on whom while so he gazd
Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst 
And bowels gushing forth well worthy end
Of such as drunke her life the which them nurst
Now needeth him no lenger labour spend

His Ladie seeing all that chaunst from farre 
Approcht in hast to greet his victorie
And said Faire knight borne under happy starre
Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye
Well worthie be you of that Armorie
Wherin ye have great glory wonne this day 
And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie
Your first adventure many such I pray

Then mounted he upon his Steede againe
And with the Lady backward sought to wend 
That path he kept which beaten was most plaine
Ne ever would to any by-way bend
But still did follow one unto the end
The which at last out of the wood them brought
So forward on his way with God to frend 
He passed forth and new adventure sought

At length they chaunst to meet upon the way
An aged Sire in long blacke weedes yclad
His feete all bare his beard all hoarie gray 
And by his belt his booke he hanging had
Sober he seemde and very sagely sad
And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent
Simple in shew and voyde of malice bad
And all the way he prayed as he went 

He faire the knight saluted louting low
Who faire him quited as that courteous was
And after asked him if he did know
Of straunge adventures which abroad did pas 
Ah my deare Sonne quoth he how should alas
Silly old man that lives in hidden cell
Bidding his beades all day for his trespas
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell

But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell
And homebred evil ye desire to heare
Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare
Of such said he I chiefly do inquere 
And shall you well reward to shew the place
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare
For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace

Far hence quoth he in wastfull wildernesse 
His dwelling is by which no living wight
May ever passe but thorough great distresse
Now sayd the Lady draweth toward night
And well I wote that of your later fight
Ye all forwearied be for what so strong 
But wanting rest will also want of might
The Sunne that measures heaven all day long

Then with the Sunne take Sir your timely rest
And with new day new worke at once begin 
Untroubled night they say gives counsell best
Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin
Quoth then that aged man the way to win
Is wisely to advise now day is spent
Therefore with me ye may take up your In 
For this same night The knight was well content

A little lowly Hermitage it was
Downe in a dale hard by a forests side
Far from resort of people that did pas 
In travell to and froe a little wyde
There was an holy Chappell edifyde
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say
His holy things each morne and eventyde
Thereby a Christall streame did gently play 

Arrived there the little house they fill
Ne looke for entertainement where none was
Rest is their feast and all things at their will
The noblest mind the best contentment has 
With faire discourse the evening so they pas
For that old man of pleasing wordes had store
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas
He told of Saintes and Popes and evermore

The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast
And the sad humour loading their eye liddes
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast
Sweet slombring deaw the which to sleepe them biddes
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes 
Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes
He to this study goes and there amiddes
His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes

Then choosing out few words most horrible 
Let none them read thereof did verses frame
With which and other spelles like terrible
He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame
And cursed heaven and spake reprochfull shame
Of highest God the Lord of life and light 
A bold bad man that dar'd to call by name
Great Gorgon Prince of darknesse and dead night

And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred
Legions of Sprights the which like little flyes 
Fluttring about his ever damned hed
Awaite whereto their service he applyes
To aide his friends or fray his enimies
Of those he chose out two the falsest twoo
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes 
The one of them he gave a message too

He making speedy way through spersed ayre
And through the world of waters wide and deepe
To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire 
Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe
And low where dawning day doth never peepe
His dwelling is there Tethys his wet bed
Doth ever wash and Cynthia still doth steepe
In silver deaw his ever-drouping hed 

Whose double gates he findeth locked fast
The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory
The other all with silver overcast
And wakeful dogges before them farre do lye 
Watching to banish Care their enimy
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe
By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly
And unto Morpheus comes whom drowned deepe

And more to lulle him in his slumber soft
A trickling streame from high rock tumbling downe
And ever-drizling raine upon the loft
Mixt with a murmuring winde much like the sowne
Of swarming Bees did cast him in a swowne 
No other noyse nor peoples troublous cryes
As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne
Might there be heard but carelesse Quiet lyes

The messenger approching to him spake 
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine
So sound he slept that nought mought him awake
Then rudely he him thrust and pusht with paine
Whereat he gan to stretch but he againe
Shooke him so hard that forced him to speake 
As one then in a dreame whose dryer braine
Is tost with troubled sights and fancies weake

The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake
And threatned unto him the dreaded name 
Of Hecate whereat he gan to quake
And lifting up his lumpish head with blame
Halfe angry asked him for what he came
Hither quoth he me Archimago sent
He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame 
He bids thee to him send for his intent

The God obayde and calling forth straightway
A diverse dreame out of his prison darke
Delivered it to him and downe did lay 
His heavie head devoide of carefull carke
Whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke
He backe returning by the Yvorie dore
Remounted up as light as chearefull Larke
And on his litle winges the dreame he bore 

Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes
Had made a Lady of that other Spright
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes
So lively and so like in all mens sight 
That weaker sence it could have ravisht quight
The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight
Her all in white he clad and over it

Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought
Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly
Where he slept soundly void of evill thought
And with false shewes abuse his fantasy
In sort as he him schooled privily 
And that new creature borne without her dew
Full of the makers guile with usage sly
He taught to imitate that Lady trew

Thus well instructed to their worke they hast 
And coming where the knight in slomber lay
The one upon his hardy head him plast
And made him dreame of loves and lustfull play
That nigh his manly hart did melt away
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy 
Then seemed him his Lady by him lay
And to him playnd how that false winged boy

And she herselfe of beautie soveraigne Queene
Fayre Venus seemde unto his bed to bring 
Her whom he waking evermore did weene
To bee the chastest flowre that ay did spring
On earthly braunch the daughter of a king
Now a loose Leman to vile service bound
And eke the Graces seemed all to sing 
Hymen Io Hymen dauncing all around

In this great passion of unwonted lust
Or wonted feare of doing ought amis
He started up as seeming to mistrust 
Some secret ill or hidden foe of his
Lo there before his face his Lady is
Under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke
And as halfe blushing offred him to kis
With gentle blandishment and lovely looke 

All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight
And half enraged at her shamelesse guise
He thought have slaine her in his fierce despight
But hasty heat tempring with suffrance wise 
He stayde his hand and gan himselfe advise
To prove his sense and tempt her faigned truth
Wringing her hands in womans pitteous wise
Tho can she weepe to stirre up gentle ruth

And said Ah Sir my liege Lord and my love
Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate
And mightie causes wrought in heaven above
Or the blind God that doth me thus amate
For hoped love to winne me certaine hate 
Yet thus perforce he bids me do or die
Die is my dew yet rew my wretched state
You whom my hard avenging destinie

Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leave 
My Fathers kingdome There she stopt with teares
Her swollen hart her speech seemd to bereave
And then againe begun My weaker yeares
Captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares
Fly to your fayth for succour and sure ayde 
Let me not dye in languor and long teares
Why Dame quoth he what hath ye thus dismayd

Love of your selfe she saide and deare constraint
Lets me not sleepe but wast the wearie night 
In secret anguish and unpittied plaint
Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight
Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight
Suspect her truth yet since no' untruth he knew
Her fawning love with foule disdainefull spight 
He would not shend but said Deare dame I rew

Assure your selfe it fell not all to ground
For all so deare as life is to my hart
I deeme your love and hold me to you bound 
Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart
Where cause is none but to your rest depart
Not all content yet seemd she to appease
Her mournefull plaintes beguiled of her art
And fed with words that could not chuse but please 

Long after lay he musing at her mood
Much griev'd to thinke that gentle Dame so light
For whose defence he was to shed his blood
At last dull wearinesse of former fight 
Having yrockt asleepe his irkesome spright
That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine
With bowres and beds and Ladies deare delight
But when he saw his labour all was vaine

By this the Northerne wagoner had set
His sevenfold teme behind the stedfast starre
That was in Ocean waves yet never wet
But firme is fixt and sendeth light from farre
To all that in the wide deepe wandring arre 
And chearefull Chaunticlere with his note shrill
Had warned once that Phoebus fiery carre
In hast was climbing up the Easterne hill

When those accursed messengers of hell 
That feigning dreame and that faire-forged Spright
Came to their wicked maister and gan tell
Their bootelesse paines and ill succeeding night
Who all in rage to see his skilfull might
Deluded so gan threaten hellish paine 
And sad Proserpines wrath them to affright
But when he saw his threatning was but vaine

Eftsoones he tooke that miscreated faire
And that false other Spright on whom he spred 
A seeming body of the subtile aire
Like a young Squire in loves and lustybed
His wanton dayes that ever loosely led
Without regard of armes and dreaded fight
Those two he tooke and in a secret bed 
Coverd with darknesse and misdeeming night

Forthwith he runnes with feigned faithfull hast
Unto his guest who after troublous sights
And dreames gan now to take more sound repast 
Whom suddenly he wakes with fearfull frights
As one aghast with feends or damned sprights
And to him cals Rise rise unhappy Swaine
That here wex old in sleepe whiles wicked wights
Have knit themselves in Venus shameful chaine 

All in amaze he suddenly upstart
With sword in hand and with the old man went
Who soone him brought into a secret part
Where that false couple were full closely ment 
In wanton lust and leud embracement
Which when he saw he burnt with gealous fire
The eye of reason was with rage yblent
And would have slaine them in his furious ire

Returning to his bed in torment great
And bitter anguish of his guiltie sight
He could not rest but did his stout heart eat
And wast his inward gall with deepe despight
Yrkesome of life and too long lingring night 
At last faire Hesperus in highest skie
Had spent his lampe and brought forth dawning light
Then up he rose and clad him hastily

Now when the rosy-fingred Morning faire 
Weary of aged Tithones saffron bed
Had spread her purple robe through deawy aire
And the high hils Titan discovered
The royall virgin shooke off drowsy-hed
And rising forth out of her baser bowre 
Lookt for her knight who far away was fled
And for her Dwarfe that wont to wait each houre

And after him she rode with so much speede
As her slow beast could make but all in vaine 
For him so far had borne his light-foot steede
Pricked with wrath and fiery fierce disdaine
That him to follow was but fruitlesse paine
Yet she her weary limbes would never rest
But every hill and dale each wood and plaine 
Did search sore grieved in her gentle brest

But subtill Archimago when his guests
He saw divided into double parts
And Una wandring in woods and forrests 
Th' end of his drift he praisd his divelish arts
That had such might over true meaning harts
Yet rests not so but other meanes doth make
How he may worke unto her further smarts
For her he hated as the hissing snake 

He then devisde himselfe how to disguise
For by his mightie science he could take
As many formes and shapes in seeming wise
As ever Proteus to himselfe could make 
Sometime a fowle sometime a fish in lake
Now like a foxe now like a dragon fell
That of himselfe he ofte for feare would quake
And oft would flie away O who can tell

But now seemde best the person to put on
Of that good knight his late beguiled guest
In mighty armes he was yclad anon
And silver shield upon his coward brest
A bloudy crosse and on his craven crest 
A bounch of haires discolourd diversly
Full jolly knight he seemde and well addrest
And when he sate upon his courser free

But he the knight whose semblaunt he did beare 
The true Saint George was wandred far away
Still flying from his thoughts and gealous feare
Will was his guide and griefe led him astray
At last him chaunst to meete upon the way
A faithless Sarazin all arm'd to point 
In whose great shield was writ with letters gay
Sans foy full large of limbe and every joint

He had a faire companion of his way
A goodly Lady clad in scarlot red 
Purfled with gold and pearle of rich assay
And like a Persian mitre on her hed
She wore with crowns and owches garnished
The which her lavish lovers to her gave
Her wanton palfrey all was overspred 
With tinsell trappings woven like a wave

With faire disport and courting dalliaunce
She intertainde her lover all the way
But when she saw the knight his speare advaunce 
She soone left off her mirth and wanton play
And bade her knight addresse him to the fray
His foe was nigh at hand He prickt with pride
And hope to winne his Ladies heart that day
Forth spurred fast adowne his coursers side 

The knight of the Redcrosse when him he spide
Spurring so hote with rage dispiteous
Gan fairely couch his speare and towards ride
Soone meete they both both fell and furious 
That daunted with their forces hideous
Their steeds do stagger and amazed stand
And eke themselves too rudely rigorous
Astonied with the stroke of their owne hand

As when two rams stird with ambitious pride
Fight for the rule of the rich fleeced flocke
Their horned fronts so fierce on either side
Do meete that with the terrour of the shocke
Astonied both stand sencelesse as a blocke 
Forgetfull of the hanging victory
So stood these twaine unmoved as a rocke
Both staring fierce and holding idely

The Sarazin sore daunted with the buffe 
Snatcheth his sword and fiercely to him flies
Who well it wards and quyteth cuff with cuff
Each others equall puissaunce envies
And through their iron sides with cruell spies
Does seeke to perce repining courage yields 
No foote to foe The flashing fier flies
As from a forge out of their burning shields

Curse on that Crosse quoth then the Sarazin
That keepes thy body from the bitter fit 
Dead long ygoe I wote thou haddest bin
Had not that charme from thee forwarned it
But yet I warne thee now assured sitt
And hide thy head Therewith upon his crest
With rigour so outrageous he smitt 
That a large share it hewd out of the rest

Who thereat wondrous wroth the sleeping spark
Of native vertue gan eftsoones revive
And at his haughtie helmet making mark 
So hugely stroke that it the steele did rive
And cleft his head He tumbling downe alive
With bloudy mouth his mother earth did kis
Greeting his grave his grudging ghost did strive
With the fraile flesh at last it flitted is 

The Lady when she saw her champion fall
Like the old ruines of a broken towre
Staid not to waile his woefull funerall
But from him fled away with all her powre 
Who after her as hastily gan scowre
Bidding the Dwarfe with him to bring away
The Sarazins shield signe of the conqueroure
Her soone he overtooke and bad to stay

She turning backe with ruefull countenaunce
Cride Mercy mercy Sir vouchsafe to show
On silly Dame subject to hard mischaunce
And to your mighty will Her humblesse low
In so ritch weedes and seeming glorious show 
Did much emmove his stout heroicke heart
And said Deare dame your suddin overthrow
Much rueth me but now put feare apart

Melting in teares then gan she thus lament 
The wretched woman whom unhappy howre
Hath now made thrall to your commandement
Before that angry heavens list to lowre
And fortune false betraide me to your powre
Was O what now availeth that I was 
Borne the sole daughter of an Emperour
He that the wide West under his rule has

He in the first flowre of my freshest age
Betrothed me unto the onely haire 
Of a most mighty king most rich and sage
Was never Prince so faithfull and so faire
Was never Prince so meeke and debonaire
But ere my hoped day of spousall shone
My dearest Lord fell from high honours staire 
Into the hands of his accursed fone

His blessed body spoild of lively breath
Was afterward I know not how convaid
And fro me hid of whose most innocent death 
When tidings came to me unhappy maid
O how great sorrow my sad soule assaid
Then forth I went his woefull corse to find
And many yeares throughout the world I straid
A virgin widow whose deepe wounded mind 

At last it chaunced this proud Sarazin
To meete me wandring who perforce me led
With him away but yet could never win
The Fort that Ladies hold in soveraigne dread 
There lies he now with foule dishonour dead
Who whiles he livde was called proud Sansfoy
The eldest of three brethren all three bred
Of one bad sire whose youngest is Sansjoy

In this sad plight friendlesse unfortunate
Now miserable I Fidessa dwell
Craving of you in pitty of my state
To do none ill if please ye not do well
He in great passion all this while did dwell 
More busying his quicke eyes her face to view
Then his dull eares to heare what she did tell
And said Faire Lady hart of flint would rew

Henceforth in safe assuraunce may ye rest 
Having both found a new friend you to aid
And lost an old foe that did you molest
Better new friend then an old foe is said
With chaunge of cheare the seeming simple maid
Let fall her eyen as shamefast to the earth 
And yeelding soft in that she nought gain-said
So forth they rode he feining seemely merth

Long time they thus together traveiled
Till weary of their way they came at last 
Where grew two goodly trees that faire did spred
Their armes abroad with gray mosse overcast
And their greene leaves trembling with every blast
Made a calme shadow far in compasse round
The fearfull Shepheard often there aghast 
Under them never sat ne wont there sound

But this good knight soone as he them can spie
For the cool shade him thither hastly got
For golden Phoebus now ymounted hie 
From fiery wheeles of his faire chariot
Hurled his beame so scorching cruell hot
That living creature mote it not abide
And his new Lady it endured not
There they alight in hope themselves to hide 

Faire seemely pleasaunce each to other makes
With goodly purposes there as they sit
And in his falsed fancy he her takes
To be the fairest wight that lived yit 
Which to expresse he bends his gentle wit
And thinking of those braunches greene to frame
A girlond for her dainty forehead fit
He pluckt a bough out of whose rift there came

Therewith a piteous yelling voyce was heard
Crying O spare with guilty hands to teare
My tender sides in this rough rynd embard
But fly ah fly far hence away for feare
Least to you hap that happened to me heare 
And to this wretched Lady my deare love
O too deare love love bought with death too deare
Astond he stood and up his haire did hove

At last whenas the dreadfull passion 
Was overpast and manhood well awake
Yet musing at the straunge occasion
And doubting much his sence he thus bespake
What voyce of damned Ghost from Limbo lake
Or guilefull spright wandring in empty aire 
Both which fraile men do oftentimes mistake
Sends to my doubtfull eares these speaches rare

Then groning deepe Nor damned Ghost quoth he
Nor guileful sprite to thee these wordes doth speake 
But once a man Fradubio now a tree
Wretched man wretched tree whose nature weake
A cruell witch her cursed will to wreake
Hath thus transformd and plast in open plaines
Where Boreas doth blow full bitter bleake 
And scorching Sunne does dry my secret vaines

Say on Fradubio then or man or tree
Quoth then the knight by whose mischievous arts
Art thou misshaped thus as now I see 
He oft finds med'cine who his griefe imparts
But double griefs afflict concealing harts
As raging flames who striveth to suppresse
The author then said he of all my smarts
Is one Duessa a false sorceresse 

In prime of youthly yeares when corage hot
The fire of love and joy of chevalree
First kindled in my brest it was my lot
To love this gentle Lady whom ye see 
Now not a Lady but a seeming tree
With whom as once I rode accompanyde
Me chaunced of a knight encountred bee
That had a like faire Lady by his syde

Whose forged beauty he did take in hand
All other Dames to have exceeded farre
I in defence of mine did likewise stand
Mine that did then shine as the Morning starre
So both to battell fierce arraunged arre 
In which his harder fortune was to fall
Under my speare such is the dye of warre
His Lady left as a prise martiall

So doubly lov'd of Ladies unlike faire 
Th' one seeming such the other such indeede
One day in doubt I cast for to compare
Whether in beauties glorie did exceede
A Rosy girlond was the victors meede
Both seemde to win and both seemde won to bee 
So hard the discord was to be agreede
Fraelissa was as faire as faire mote bee

The wicked witch now seeing all this while
The doubtfull ballaunce equally to sway 
What not by right she cast to win by guile
And by her hellish science raisd streightway
A foggy mist that overcast the day
And a dull blast that breathing on her face
Dimmed her former beauties shining ray 
And with foule ugly forme did her disgrace

Then cride she out Fye fye deformed wight
Whose borrowed beautie now appeareth plaine
To have before bewitched all mens sight 
O leave her soone or let her soone be slaine
Her loathly visage viewing with disdaine
Eftsoones I thought her such as she me told
And would have kild her but with faigned paine
The false witch did my wrathfull hand with-hold 

Then forth I tooke Duessa for my Dame
And in the witch unweeting joyd long time
Ne ever wist but that she was the same
Till on a day that day is every Prime 
When Witches wont do penance for their crime
I chaunst to see her in her proper hew
Bathing her selfe in origane and thyme
A filthy foule old woman I did vew

Her neather parts misshapen monstruous
Were hidd in water that I could not see
But they did seeme more foule and hideous
Then womans shape man would beleeve to bee
Thensforth from her most beastly companie 
I gan refraine in minde to slip away
Soone as appeard safe opportunitie
For danger great if not assur'd decay

The divelish hag by chaunges of my cheare 
Perceiv'd my thought and drownd in sleepie night
With wicked herbs and ointments did besmeare
My body all through charms and magicke might
That all my senses were bereaved quight
Then brought she me into this desert waste 
And by my wretched lovers side me pight
Where now enclosd in wooden wals full faste

But how long time said then the Elfin knight
Are you in this misformed house to dwell 
We may not chaunge quoth he this evil plight
Till we be bathed in a living well
That is the terme prescribed by the spell
O how said he mote I that well out find
That may restore you to your wonted well 
Time and suffised fates to former kynd

The false Duessa now Fidessa hight
Heard how in vaine Fradubio did lament
And knew well all was true But the good knight 
Full of sad feare and ghastly dreriment
When all this speech the living tree had spent
The bleeding bough did thrust into the ground
That from the bloud he might be innocent
And with fresh clay did close the wooden wound 

Her seeming dead he found with feigned feare
As all unweeting of that well she knew
And paynd himselfe with busie care to reare
Her out of carelesse swowne Her eyelids blew 
And dimmed sight with pale and deadly hew
At last she up gan lift with trembling cheare
Her up he tooke too simple and too trew
And oft her kist At length all passed feare

Nought is there under heav'ns wide hollownesse
That moves more deare compassion of mind
Then beautie brought t' unworthy wretchednesse
Through envies snares or fortunes freakes unkind
I whether lately through her brightnesse blind 
Or through alleageance and fast fealtie
Which I do owe unto all woman kind
Feele my hart perst with so great agonie

And now it is empassioned so deepe 
For fairest Unaes sake of whom I sing
That my fraile eyes these lines with teares do steepe
To thinke how she through guilefull handeling
Though true as touch though daughter of a king
Though faire as ever living wight was faire 
Though nor in word nor deede ill meriting
Is from her knight divorced in despaire

Yet she most faithfull Ladie all this while
Forsaken wofull solitarie mayd 
Far from all peoples prease as in exile
In wildernesse and wastfull deserts strayd
To seeke her knight who subtilly betrayd
Through that late vision which th' Enchaunter wrought
Had her abandond She of nought affrayd 
Through woods and wastnesse wide him daily sought

One day nigh wearie of the yrkesome way
From her unhastie beast she did alight
And on the grasse her daintie limbes did lay 
In secret shadow farre from all mens sight
From her faire head her fillet she undight
And laid her stole aside Her angels face
As the great eye of heaven shyned bright
And made a sunshine in the shadie place 

It fortuned out of the thickest wood
A ramping Lyon rushed suddainly
Hunting full greedy after salvage blood
Soone as the royall virgin he did spy 
With gaping mouth at her ran greedily
To have attonce devourd her tender corse
But to the pray when as he drew more ny
His bloody rage asswaged with remorse

In stead thereof he kist her wearie feet
And lickt her lilly hands with fawning tong
As he her wronged innocence did weet
O how can beautie maister the most strong
And simple truth subdue avenging wrong 
Whose yeelded pride and proud submission
Still dreading death when she had marked long
Her hart gan melt in great compassion

The Lyon Lord of every beast in field 
Quoth she his princely puissance doth abate
And mightie proud to humble weake does yield
Forgetfull of the hungry rage which late
Him prickt in pittie of my sad estate
But he my Lyon and my noble Lord 
How does he find in cruell hart to hate
Her that him lov'd and ever most adord

Redounding teares did choke th' end of her plaint
Which softly ecchoed from the neighbour wood 
And sad to see her sorrowfull constraint
The kingly beast upon her gazing stood
With pittie calmd downe fell his angry mood
At last in close hart shutting up her paine
Arose the virgin borne of heavenly brood 
And to her snowy Palfrey got againe

The Lyon would not leave her desolate
But with her went along as a strong gard
Of her chast person and a faithfull mate 
Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard
Still when she slept he kept both watch and ward
And when she wakt he waited diligent
With humble service to her will prepard
From her faire eyes he tooke commaundement 

Long she thus traveiled through deserts wyde
By which she thought her wandring knight shold pas
Yet never shew of living wight espyde
Till that at length she found the troden gras 
In which the tract of peoples footing was
Under the steepe foot of a mountaine hore
The same she followes till at last she has
A damzell spyde slow footing her before

To whom approching she to her gan call
To weet if dwelling place were nigh at hand
But the rude wench her answerd nought at all
She could not heare nor speake nor understand
Till seeing by her side the Lyon stand 
With suddaine feare her pitcher downe she threw
And fled away for never in that land
Face of faire Ladie she before did vew

Full fast she fled ne never lookt behynd 
As if her life upon the wager lay
And home she came whereas her mother blynd
Sate in eternall night nought could she say
But suddaine catching hold did her dismay
With quaking hands and other signes of feare 
Who full of ghastly fright and cold affray
Gan shut the dore By this arrived there

Which when none yeelded her unruly Page
With his rude claws the wicket open rent 
And let her in where of his cruell rage
Nigh dead with feare and faint astonishment
She found them both in darkesome corner pent
Where that old woman day and night did pray
Upon her beads devoutly penitent 
Nine hundred Pater nosters every day

And to augment her painefull pennance more
Thrise every weeke in ashes she did sit
And next her wrinkled skin rough sackcloth wore 
And thrise three times did fast from any bit
But now for feare her beads she did forget
Whose needlesse dread for to remove away
Faire Una framed words and count'nance fit
Which hardly doen at length she gan them pray 

The day is spent and commeth drowsie night
When every creature shrowded is in sleepe
Sad Una downe her laies in wearie plight
And at her feete the Lyon watch doth keepe 
In stead of rest she does lament and weepe
For the late losse of her deare loved knight
And sighes and grones and ever more does steepe
Her tender brest in bitter teares all night

Now when Aldeboran was mounted hie
Above the shynie Cassiopeias chaire
And all in deadly sleepe did drowned lie
One knocked at the dore and in would fare
He knocked fast and often curst and sware 
That readie entrance was not at his call
For on his backe a heavy load he bare
Of nightly stelths and pillage severall

He was to weete a stout and sturdy thiefe 
Wont to robbe Churches of their ornaments
And poore mens boxes of their due reliefe
Which given was to them for good intents
The holy Saints of their rich vestiments
He did disrobe when all men carelesse slept 
And spoild the Priests of their habiliments
Whiles none the holy things in safety kept

And all that he by right or wrong could find
Unto this house he brought and did bestow 
Upon the daughter of this woman blind
Abessa daughter of Corceca slow
With whom he whoredome usd that few did know
And fed her fat with feast of offerings
And plentie which in all the land did grow 
Ne spared he to give her gold and rings

Thus long the dore with rage and threats he bet
Yet of those fearfull women none durst rize
The Lyon frayed them him in to let 
He would no longer stay him to advize
But open breakes the dore in furious wize
And entring is when that disdainfull beast
Encountring fierce him suddaine doth surprize
And seizing cruell clawes on trembling brest 

Him booteth not resist nor succour call
His bleeding hart is in the vengers hand
Who streight him rent in thousand peeces small
And quite dismembred hath the thirsty land 
Drunke up his life his corse left on the strand
His fearefull friends weare out the wofull night
Ne dare to weepe nor seeme to understand
The heavie hap which on them is alight

Now when broad day the world discovered has
Up Una rose up rose the Lyon eke
And on their former journey forward pas
In wayes unknowne her wandring knight to seeke
With paines farre passing that long wandring Greeke 
That for his love refused deitie
Such were the labours of his Lady meeke
Still seeking him that from her still did flie

Soone as she parted thence the fearfull twaine 
That blind old woman and her daughter deare
Came forth and finding Kirkrapine there slaine
For anguish great they gan to rend their heare
And beat their brests and naked flesh to teare
And when they both had wept and wayld their fill 
Then forth they ran like two amazed deare
Halfe mad through malice and revenging will

Whom overtaking they gan loudly bray
With hollow howling and lamenting cry 
Shamefully at her rayling all the way
And her accusing of dishonesty
That was the flowre of faith and chastity
And still amidst her rayling she did pray
That plagues and mischiefs and long misery 
Might fall on her and follow all the way

But when she saw her prayers nought prevaile
She backe returned with some labour lost
And in the way as shee did weepe and waile 
A knight her met in mighty armes embost
Yet knight was not for all his bragging bost
But subtill Archimag that Una sought
By traynes into new troubles to have tost
Of that old woman tidings he besought 

Therewith she gan her passion to renew
And cry and curse and raile and rend her heare
Saying that harlot she too lately knew
That caused her shed so many a bitter teare 
And so forth told the story of her feare
Much seemed he to mone her haplesse chaunce
And after for that Ladie did inquere
Which being taught he forward gan advaunce

Ere long he came where Una traveild slow
And that wilde Champion wayting her besyde
Whom seeing such for dread he durst not show
Himselfe too nigh at hand but turned wyde
Unto an hill from whence when she him spyde 
By his like seeming shield her knight by name
She weend it was and towards him gan ryde
Approaching nigh she wist it was the same

And weeping said Ah my long lacked Lord 
Where have ye bene thus long out of my sight
Much feared I to have bene quite abhord
Or ought have done that ye displeasen might
That should as death unto my deare heart light
For since mine eye your joyous sight did mis 
My chearefull day is turnd to chearelesse night
And eke my night of death the shadow is

He thereto meeting said My dearest Dame
Farre be it from your thought and fro my will 
To thinke that knighthood I so much should shame
As you to leave that have me loved still
And chose in Faery court of meere goodwill
Where noblest knights were to be found on earth
The earth shall sooner leave her kindly skill 
To bring forth fruit and make eternall derth

And sooth to say why I left you so long
Was for to seeke adventure in strange place
Where Archimago said a felon strong 
To many knights did daily worke disgrace
But knight he now shall never more deface
Good cause of mine excuse that mote ye please
Well to accept and evermore embrace
My faithfull service that by land and seas 

His lovely words her seemd due recompence
Of all her passed paines one loving howre
For many yeares of sorrow can dispence
A dram of sweet is worth a pound of sowre 
She has forgot how many a woful stowre
For him she late endurd she speakes no more
Of past true is that true love hath no powre
To looken backe his eyes be fixt before

Much like as when the beaten marinere
That long hath wandred in the Ocean wide
Oft soust in swelling Tethys saltish teare
And long time having tand his tawney hide
With blustring breath of heaven that none can bide 
And scorching flames of fierce Orions hound
Soone as the port from farre he has espide
His chearefull whistle merrily doth sound

Such joy made Una when her knight she found 
And eke th' enchaunter joyous seemd no lesse
Then the glad marchant that does vew from ground
His ship farre come from watrie wildernesse
He hurles out vowes and Neptune oft doth blesse
So forth they past and all the way they spent 
Discoursing of her dreadful late distresse
In which he askt her what the Lyon ment

They had not ridden farre when they might see
One pricking towards them with hastie heat 
Full strongly armd and on a courser free
That through his fiercenesse fomed all with sweat
And the sharpe yron did for anger eat
When his hot ryder spurd his chauffed side
His looke was sterne and seemed still to threat 
Cruell revenge which he in hart did hyde

When nigh he drew unto this gentle payre
And saw the Red-crosse which the knight did beare
He burnt in fire and gan eftsoones prepare 
Himselfe to battell with his couched speare
Loth was that other and did faint through feare
To taste th' untryed dint of deadly steele
But yet his Lady did so well him cheare
That hope of new goodhap he gan to feele 

But that proud Paynim forward came so fierce
And full of wrath that with his sharp-head speare
Through vainly crossed shield he quite did pierce
And had his staggering steede not shrunke for feare 
Through shield and bodie eke he should him beare
Yet so great was the puissance of his push
That from his saddle quite he did him beare
He tombling rudely downe to ground did rush

Dismounting lightly from his loftie steed
He to him lept in mind to reave his life
And proudly said Lo there the worthie meed
Of him that slew Sansfoy with bloudie knife
Henceforth his ghost freed from repining strife 
In peace may passen over Lethe lake
When mourning altars purgd with enemies life
The blacke infernall Furies doen aslake

Therewith in haste his helmet gan unlace 
Till Una cried O hold that heavie hand
Deare Sir what ever that thou be in place
Enough is that thy foe doth vanquisht stand
Now at thy mercy Mercie not withstand
For he is one the truest knight alive 
Though conquered now he lie on lowly land
And whilest him fortune favourd faire did thrive

Her piteous words might not abate his rage
But rudely rending up his helmet would 
Have slaine him straight but when he sees his age
And hoarie head of Archimago old
His hasty hand he doth amazed hold
And halfe ashamed wondred at the sight
For that old man well knew he though untold 
In charmes and magicke to have wondrous might

And said Why Archimago lucklesse syre
What doe I see what hard mishap is this
That hath thee hither brought to taste mine yre 
Or thine the fault or mine the error is
Instead of foe to wound my friend amis
He answered nought but in a traunce still lay
And on those guilefull dazed eyes of his
The cloude of death did sit Which doen away 

But to the virgin comes who all this while
Amased stands her selfe so mockt to see
By him who has the guerdon of his guile
For so misfeigning her true knight to bee 
Yet is she now in more perplexitie
Left in the hand of that same Paynim bold
From whom her booteth not at all to flie
Who by her cleanly garment catching hold

But her fierce servant full of kingly awe
And high disdaine whenas his soveraine Dame
So rudely handled by her foe he sawe
With gaping jawes full greedy at him came
And ramping on his shield did weene the same 
Have reft away with his sharpe rending clawes
But he was stout and lust did now inflame
His corage more that from his griping pawes

O then too weake and feeble was the forse 
Of salvage beast his puissance to withstand
For he was strong and of so mightie corse
As ever wielded speare in warlike hand
And feates of armes did wisely understand
Eftsoones he perced through his chaufed chest 
With thrilling point of deadly yron brand
And launcht his Lordly hart with death opprest

Who now is left to keepe the forlorne maid
From raging spoile of lawlesse victors will 
Her faithfull gard remov'd her hope dismaid
Her selfe a yielded pray to save or spill
He now Lord of the field his pride to fill
With foule reproches and disdainfull spight
Her vildly entertaines and will or nill 
Beares her away upon his courser light

And all the way with great lamenting paine
And piteous plaints she filleth his dull eares
That stony hart could riven have in twaine 
And all the way she wets with flowing teares
But he enrag'd with rancor nothing heares
Her servile beast yet would not leave her so
But followes her farre off ne ought he feares
To be partaker of her wandring woe 

Young knight whatever that dost armes professe
And through long labours huntest after fame
Beware of fraud beware of ficklenesse
In choice and change of thy deare loved Dame
Least thou of her beleeve too lightly blame 
And rash misweening doe thy hart remove
For unto knight there is no greater shame
Then lightnesse and inconstancie in love

Who after that he had faire Una lorne 
Through light misdeeming of her loialtie
And false Duessa in her sted had borne
Called Fidess' and so supposd to bee
Long with her traveild till at last they see
A goodly building bravely garnished 
The house of mightie Prince it seemd to bee
And towards it a broad high way that led

Great troupes of people traveild thitherward
Both day and night of each degree and place 
But few returned having scaped hard
With balefull beggerie or foule disgrace
Which ever after in most wretched case
Like loathsome lazars by the hedges lay
Thither Duessa bad him bend his pace 
For she is wearie of the toilesome way

A stately Pallace built of squared bricke
Which cunningly was without morter laid
Whose wals were high but nothing strong nor thick 
And golden foile all over them displaid
That purest skye with brightnesse they dismaid
High lifted up were many loftie towres
And goodly galleries farre over laid
Full of faire windowes and delightful bowres 

It was a goodly heape for to behould
And spake the praises of the workmans wit
But full great pittie that so faire a mould
Did on so weake foundation ever sit 
For on a sandie hill that still did flit
And fall away it mounted was full hie
That every breath of heaven shaked it
And all the hinder parts that few could spie

Arrived there they passed in forth right
For still to all the gates stood open wide
Yet charge of them was to a Porter hight
Cald Malvenu who entrance none denide
Thence to the hall which was on every side 
With rich array and costly arras dight
Infinite sorts of people did abide
There waiting long to win the wished sight

By them they passe all gazing on them round 
And to the Presence mount whose glorious vew
Their frayle amazed senses did confound
In living Princes court none ever knew
Such endlesse richesse and so sumptuous shew
Ne Persia selfe the nourse of pompous pride 
Like ever saw And there a noble crew
Of Lordes and Ladies stood on every side

High above all a cloth of State was spred
And a rich throne as bright as sunny day 
On which there sate most brave embellished
With royall robes and gorgeous array
A mayden Queene that shone as Titans ray
In glistring gold and peerelesse pretious stone
Yet her bright blazing beautie did assay 
To dim the brightnesse of her glorious throne

Exceeding shone like Phoebus fairest childe
That did presume his fathers firie wayne
And flaming mouthes of steedes unwonted wilde 
Through highest heaven with weaker hand to rayne
Proud of such glory and advancement vaine
While flashing beames do daze his feeble eyen
He leaves the welkin way most beaten plaine
And rapt with whirling wheeles inflames the skyen 

So proud she shyned in her Princely state
Looking to heaven for earth she did disdayne
And sitting high for lowly she did hate
Lo underneath her scornefull feete was layne 
A dreadfull Dragon with an hideous trayne
And in her hand she held a mirrhour bright
Wherein her face she often vewed fayne
And in her selfe-lov'd semblance tooke delight

Of griesly Pluto she the daughter was
And sad Proserpina the Queene of hell
Yet did she thinke her pearlesse worth to pas
That parentage with pride so did she swell
And thundring Jove that high in heaven doth dwell 
And wield the world she claymed for her syre
Or if that any else did Jove excell
For to the highest she did still aspyre

And proud Lucifera men did her call 
That made her selfe a Queene and crownd to be
Yet rightfull kingdome she had none at all
Ne heritage of native soveraintie
But did usurpe with wrong and tyrannie
Upon the scepter which she now did hold 
Ne ruld her Realmes with lawes but pollicie
And strong advizement of six wisards old

Soone as the Elfin knight in presence came
And false Duessa seeming Lady faire 
A gentle Husher Vanitie by name
Made rowme and passage for them did prepaire
So goodly brought them to the lowest staire
Of her high throne where they on humble knee
Making obeyssance did the cause declare 
Why they were come her royall state to see

With loftie eyes halfe loth to looke so low
She thanked them in her disdainefull wise
Ne other grace vouchsafed them to show 
Of Princesse worthy scarse them bad arise
Her Lordes and Ladies all this while devise
Themselves to setten forth to straungers sight
Some frounce their curled haire in courtly guise
Some prancke their ruffes and others trimly dight 

Goodly they all that knight do entertaine
Right glad with him to have increast their crew
But to Duess' each one himselfe did paine
All kindnesse and faire courtesie to shew 
For in that court whylome her well they knew
Yet the stout Faerie mongst the middest crowd
Thought all their glorie vaine in knightly vew
And that great Princesse too exceeding prowd

Suddein upriseth from her stately place
The royall Dame and for her coche did call
All hurtlen forth and she with Princely pace
As faire Aurora in her purple pall
Out of the east the dawning day doth call 
So forth she comes her brightnesse brode doth blaze
The heapes of people thronging in the hall
Do ride each other upon her to gaze

So forth she comes and to her coche does clyme 
Adorned all with gold and girlonds gay
That seemd as fresh as Flora in her prime
And strove to match in royall rich array
Great Junoes golden chaire the which they say
The Gods stand gazing on when she does ride 
To Joves high house through heavens bras-paved way
Drawne of faire Pecocks that excell in pride

But this was drawne of six unequall beasts
On which her six sage Counsellours did ryde 
Taught to obay their bestiall beheasts
With like conditions to their kinds applyde
Of which the first that all the rest did guyde
Was sluggish Idlenesse the nourse of sin
Upon a slouthful Asse he chose to ryde 
Arayd in habit blacke and amis thin

And in his hand his Portesse still he bare
That much was worne but therein little red
For of devotion he had little care 
Still drownd in sleepe and most of his dayes ded
Scarse could he once uphold his heavie hed
To looken whether it were night or day
May seeme the wayne was very evill led
When such an one had guiding of the way 

From worldly cares himselfe he did esloyne
And greatly shunned manly exercise
From every worke he chalenged essoyne
For contemplation sake yet otherwise 
His life he led in lawlesse riotise
By which he grew to grievous malady
For in his lustlesse limbs through evill guise
A shaking fever raignd continually

And by his side rode loathsome Gluttony
Deformed creature on a filthie swyne
His belly was up-blowne with luxury
And eke with fatnesse swollen were his eyne
And like a Crane his necke was long and fyne 
With which he swallowed up excessive feast
For want whereof poore people oft did pyne
And all the way most like a brutish beast

In greene vine leaves he was right fitly clad 
For other clothes he could not weare for heat
And on his head an yvie girland had
From under which fast trickled downe the sweat
Still as he rode he somewhat still did eat
And in his hand did beare a bouzing can 
Of which he supt so oft that on his seat
His dronken corse he scarse upholden can

Unfit he was for any worldly thing
And eke unhable once to stirre or go 
Not meet to be of counsell to a king
Whose mind in meat and drinke was drowned so
That from his friend he seldome knew his fo
Full of diseases was his carcas blew
And a dry dropsie through his flesh did flow 
Which by misdiet daily greater grew

And next to him rode lustfull Lechery
Upon a bearded Goat whose rugged haire
And whally eyes the signe of gelosy 
Was like the person selfe whom he did beare
Who rough and blacke and filthy did appeare
Unseemely man to please faire Ladies eye
Yet he of Ladies oft was loved deare
When fairer faces were bid standen by 

In a greene gowne he clothed was full faire
Which underneath did hide his filthinesse
And in his hand a burning hart he bare
Full of vaine follies and new fanglenesse 
For he was false and fraught with ficklenesse
And learned had to love with secret lookes
And well could daunce and sing with ruefulnesse
And fortunes tell and read in loving bookes

Inconstant man that loved all he saw
And lusted after all that he did love
Ne would his looser life be tide to law
But joyd weak wemens hearts to tempt and prove
If from their loyall loves he might them move 
Which lewdnesse fild him with reprochfull paine
Of that fowle evill which all men reprove
That rots the marrow and consumes the braine

And greedy Avarice by him did ride 
Upon a Camell loaden all with gold
Two iron coffers hong on either side
With precious mettall full as they might hold
And in his lap an heape of coine he told
For of his wicked pelfe his God he made 
And unto hell him selfe for money sold
Accursed usurie was all his trade

His life was nigh unto deaths doore yplast
And thred-bare cote and cobled shoes he ware 
Ne scarse good morsell all his life did tast
But both from backe and belly still did spare
To fill his bags and richesse to compare
Yet chylde ne kinsman living had he none
To leave them to but thorough daily care 
To get and nightly feare to lose his owne

Most wretched wight whom nothing might suffise
Whose greedy lust did lacke in greatest store
Whose need had end but no end covetise 
Whose wealth was want whose plenty made him pore
Who had enough yet wished ever more
A vile disease and eke in foote and hand
A grievous gout tormented him full sore
That well he could not touch nor go nor stand 

And next to him malicious Envie rode
Upon a ravenous wolfe and still did chaw
Betweene his cankred teeth a venemous tode
That all the poison ran about his chaw 
But inwardly he chawed his owne maw
At neighbours wealth that made him ever sad
For death it was when any good he saw
And wept that cause of weeping none he had

All in a kirtle of discolourd say
He clothed was ypainted full of eyes
And in his bosome secretly there lay
An hatefull Snake the which his taile uptyes
In many folds and mortall sting implyes 
Still as he rode he gnasht his teeth to see
Those heapes of gold with griple Covetyse
And grudged at the great felicitie

He hated all good workes and vertuous deeds 
And him no lesse that any like did use
And who with gracious bread the hungry feeds
His almes for want of faith he doth accuse
So every good to bad he doth abuse
And eke the verse of famous Poets witt 
He does backebite and spightfull poison spues
From leprous mouth on all that ever writt

And him beside rides fierce revenging Wrath
Upon a Lion loth for to be led 
And in his hand a burning brond he hath
The which he brandisheth about his hed
His eyes did hurle forth sparkles fiery red
And stared sterne on all that him beheld
As ashes pale of hew and seeming ded 
And on his dagger still his hand he held

His ruffin raiment all was staind with blood
Which he had spilt and all to rags yrent
Through unadvized rashnesse woxen wood 
For of his hands he had no governement
Ne car'd for bloud in his avengement
But when the furious fit was overpast
His cruell facts he often would repent
Yet wilfull man he never would forecast 

Full many mischiefes follow cruell Wrath
Abhorred bloodshed and tumultuous strife
Unmanly murder and unthrifty scath
Bitter despight with rancours rusty knife 
And fretting griefe the enemy of life
All these and many evils moe haunt ire
The swelling Splene and Frenzy raging rife
The shaking Palsey and Saint Fraunces fire

And after all upon the wagon beame
Rode Sathan with a smarting whip in hand
With which he forward lasht the laesie teme
So oft as Slowth still in the mire did stand
Hugh routs of people did about them band 
Showting for joy and still before their way
A foggy mist had covered all the land
And underneath their feet all scattered lay

So forth they marchen in this goodly sort 
To take the solace of the open aire
And in fresh flowring fields themselves to sport
Emongst the rest rode that false Lady faire
The foule Duessa next unto the chaire
Of proud Lucifera as one of the traine 
But that good knight would not so nigh repaire
Him selfe estraunging from their joyaunce vaine

So having solaced themselves a space
With pleasaunce of the breathing fields yfed 
They backe retourned to the Princely Place
Whereas an errant knight in armes ycled
And heathnish shield wherein with letters red
Was writ Sans joy they new arrived find
Enflam'd with fury and fiers hardy-hed 
He seemd in hart to harbour thoughts unkind

Who when the shamed shield of slaine Sansfoy
He spide with that same Faery champions page
Bewraying him that did of late destroy 
His eldest brother burning all with rage
He to him leapt and that same envious gage
Of victors glory from him snatcht away
But th' Elfin knight which ought that warlike wage
Disdaind to loose the meed he wonne in fray 

Therewith they gan to hurtlen greedily
Redoubted battaile ready to darrayne
And clash their shields and shake their swords on hy
That with their sturre they troubled all the traine 
Till that great Queene upon eternall paine
Of high displeasure that ensewen might
Commaunded them their fury to refraine
And if that either to that shield had right

Ah dearest Dame quoth then the Paynim bold
Pardon the error of enraged wight
Whom great griefe made forget the raines to hold
Of reasons rule to see this recreant knight
No knight but treachour full of false despight 
And shamefull treason who through guile hath slayn
The prowest knight that ever field did fight
Even stout Sansfoy O who can then refrayn

And to augment the glorie of his guile 
His dearest love the faire Fidessa loe
Is there possessed of the traytour vile
Who reapes the harvest sowen by his foe
Sowen in bloudy field and bought with woe
That brothers hand shall dearely well requight 
So be O Queene you equall favour showe
Him litle answerd th' angry Elfin knight

But threw his gauntlet as a sacred pledge
His cause in combat the next day to try 
So been they parted both with harts on edge
To be aveng'd each on his enimy
That night they pas in joy and jollity
Feasting and courting both in bowre and hall
For Steward was excessive Gluttonie 
That of his plenty poured forth to all

Now whenas darkesome night had all displayed
Her coleblacke curtein over brightest skye
The warlike youthes on dayntie couches layd 
Did chace away sweet sleepe from sluggish eye
To muse on meanes of hoped victory
But whenas Morpheus had with leaden mace
Arrested all that courtly company
Up-rose Duessa from her resting place 

Whom broad awake she finds in troublous fit
Forecasting how his foe he might annoy
And him amoves with speaches seeming fit
Ah deare Sansjoy next dearest to Sansfoy 
Cause of my new griefe cause of my new joy
Joyous to see his ymage in mine eye
And greev'd to thinke how foe did him destroy
That was the flowre of grace and chevalrye

With gentle wordes he can her fairely greet
And bad say on the secret of her hart
Then sighing soft I learne that litle sweet
Oft tempred is quoth she with muchell smart
For since my brest was launcht with lovely dart 
Of deare Sans foy I never joyed howre
But in eternall woes my weaker hart
Have wasted loving him with all my powre

At last when perils all I weened past 
And hop'd to reape the crop of all my care
Into new woes unweeting I was cast
By this false faytor who unworthy ware
His worthy shield whom he with guilefull snare
Entrapped slew and brought to shamefull grave 
Me silly maid away with him he bare
And ever since hath kept in darksome cave

But since faire Sunne hath sperst that lowring clowd
And to my loathed life now shewes some light 
Under your beames I will me safely shrowd
From dreaded storme of his disdainfull spight
To you th' inheritance belongs by right
Of brothers prayse to you eke longs his love
Let not his love let not his restlesse spright 
Be unreveng'd that calles to you above

Thereto said he Faire Dame be nought dismaid
For sorrowes past their griefe is with them gone
Ne yet of present perill be affraid 
For needlesse feare did never vantage none
And helplesse hap it booteth not to mone
Dead is Sansfoy his vitall paines are past
Though greeved ghost for vengeance deepe do grone
He lives that shall him pay his dewties last 

O but I feare the fickle freakes quoth shee
Of fortune false and oddes of armes in field
Why Dame quoth he what oddes can ever bee
Where both do fight alike to win or yield 
Yea but quoth she he beares a charmed shield
And eke enchaunted armes that none can perce
Ne none can wound the man that does them wield
Charmd or enchaunted answerd he then ferce

But faire Fidessa sithens fortunes guile
Or enimies powre hath now captived you
Returne from whence ye came and rest a while
Till morrow next that I the Elfe subdew
And with Sansfoyes dead dowry you endew 
Ay me that is a double death she said
With proud foes sight my sorrow to renew
Where ever yet I be my secret aid

THE noble hart that harbours vertuous thought
And is with child of glorious great intent
Can never rest untill it forth have brought
Th' eternall brood of glorie excellent
Such restlesse passion did all night torment 
The flaming corage of that Faery knight
Devizing how that doughtie turnament
With greatest honour he atchieven might

At last the golden Orientall gate 
Of greatest heaven gan to open faire
And Phoebus fresh as bridegrome to his mate
Came dauncing forth shaking his deawie haire
And hurls his glistring beams through gloomy aire
Which when the wakeful Elfe perceiv'd streightway 
He started up and did him selfe prepaire
In sunbright armes and battailous array

And forth he comes into the commune hall
Where earely waite him many a gazing eye 
To weet what end to straunger knights may fall
There many Minstrales maken melody
To drive away the dull melancholy
And many Bardes that to the trembling chord
Can tune their timely voyces cunningly 
And many Chroniclers that can record

Soone after comes the cruell Sarazin
In woven maile all armed warily
And sternly lookes at him who not a pin 
Does care for looke of living creatures eye
They bring them wines of Greece and Araby
And daintie spices fetcht from furthest Ynd
To kindle heat of corage privily
And in the wine a solemne oth they bynd 

At last forth comes that far renowmed Queene
With royall pomp and Princely majestie
She is ybrought unto a paled greene
And placed under stately canapee 
The warlike feates of both those knights to see
On th' other side in all mens open vew
Duessa placed is and on a tree
Sans-foy his shield is hangd with bloody hew

A shrilling trompet sownded from on hye
And unto battaill bad them selves addresse
Their shining shieldes about their wrestes they tye
And burning blades about their heads do blesse
The instruments of wrath and heavinesse 
With greedy force each other doth assayle
And strike so fiercely that they do impresse
Deepe dinted furrowes in the battred mayle

The Sarazin was stout and wondrous strong 
And heaped blowes like yron hammers great
For after bloud and vengeance he did long
The knight was fiers and full of youthly heat
And doubled strokes like dreaded thunders threat
For all for prayse and honour he did fight 
Both stricken strike and beaten both do beat
That from their shields forth flyeth firie light

So th' one for wrong the other strives for right
As when a Gryfon seized of his pray 
A Dragon fiers encountreth in his flight
Through widest ayre making his ydle way
That would his rightfull ravine rend away
With hideous horror both together smight
And souce so sore that they the heavens affray 
The wise Soothsayer seeing so sad sight

So th' one for wrong the other strives for right
And each to deadly shame would drive his foe
The cruell steele so greedily doth bight 
In tender flesh that streames of bloud down flow
With which the armes that earst so bright did show
Into a pure vermillion now are dyde
Great ruth in all the gazers harts did grow
Seeing the gored woundes to gape so wyde 

At last the Paynim chaunst to cast his eye
His suddein eye flaming with wrathful fyre
Upon his brothers shield which hong thereby
Therewith redoubled was his raging yre 
And said Ah wretched sonne of wofull syre
Doest thou sit wayling by blacke Stygian lake
Whilest here thy shield is hangd for victors hyre
And sluggish german doest thy forces slake

Goe caytive Elfe him quickly overtake
And soone redeeme from his long wandring woe
Goe guiltie ghost to him my message make
That I his shield have quit from dying foe
Therewith upon his crest he stroke him so 
That twise he reeled readie twise to fall
End of the doubtfull battell deemed tho
The lookers on and lowd to him gan call

Soone as the Faerie heard his Ladie speake 
Out of his swowning dreame he gan awake
And quickning faith that earst was woxen weake
The creeping deadly cold away did shake
Tho mov'd with wrath and shame and Ladies sake
Of all attonce he cast avengd to bee 
And with so' exceeding furie at him strake
That forced him to stoupe upon his knee

And to him said Goe now proud Miscreant
Thy selfe thy message do to german deare 
Alone he wandring thee too long doth want
Goe say his foe thy shield with his doth beare
Therewith his heavie hand he high gan reare
Him to have slaine when loe a darkesome clowd
Upon him fell he no where doth appeare 
But vanisht is The Elfe him calls alowd

In haste Duessa from her place arose
And to him running said O prowest knight
That ever Ladie to her love did chose 
Let now abate the terror of your might
And quench the flame of furious despight
And bloudie vengeance lo th' infernall powres
Covering your foe with cloud of deadly night
Have borne him hence to Plutoes balefull bowres 

Not all so satisfide with greedie eye
He sought all round about his thristie blade
To bath in bloud of faithlesse enemy
Who all that while lay hid in secret shade 
He standes amazed how he thence should fade
At last the trumpets Triumph sound on hie
And running Heralds humble homage made
Greeting him goodly with new victorie

Wherewith he goeth to that soveraine Queene
And falling her before on lowly knee
To her makes present of his service seene
Which she accepts with thankes and goodly gree
Greatly advauncing his gay chevalree 
So marcheth home and by her takes the knight
Whom all the people follow with great glee
Shouting and clapping all their hands on hight

Home is he brought and laid in sumptuous bed 
Where many skilfull leaches him abide
To salve his hurts that yet still freshly bled
In wine and oyle they wash his woundes wide
And softly can embalme on every side
And all the while most heavenly melody 
About the bed sweet musicke did divide
Him to beguile of griefe and agony

As when a wearie traveller that strayes
By muddy shore of broad seven-mouthed Nile 
Unweeting of the perillous wandring wayes
Doth meete a cruell craftie Crocodile
Which in false griefe hyding his harmefull guile
Doth weepe full sore and sheddeth tender teares
The foolish man that pitties all this while 
His mournefull plight is swallowed up unawares

So wept Duessa untill eventide
That shyning lampes in Joves high house were light
Then forth she rose ne lenger would abide 
But comes unto the place where th' Hethen knight
In slombring swownd nigh voyd of vitall spright
Lay cover'd with inchaunted cloud all day
Whom when she found as she him left in plight
To wayle his woefull case she would not stay 

Where griesly Night with visage deadly sad
That Phoebus chearefull face durst never vew
And in a foule blacke pitchie mantle clad
She findes forth comming from her darkesome mew 
Where she all day did hide her hated hew
Before the dore her yron charet stood
Alreadie harnessed for journey new
And coleblacke steedes yborne of hellish brood

Who when she saw Duessa sunny bright
Adornd with gold and jewels shining cleare
She greatly grew amazed at the sight
And th' unacquainted light began to feare
For never did such brightnesse there appeare 
And would have backe retyred to her cave
Until the witches speech she gan to heare
Saying Yet O thou dreaded Dame I crave

She stayd and foorth Duessa gan proceede 
O thou most auncient Grandmother of all
More old then Jove whom thou at first didst breede
Or that great house of Gods caelestiall
Which wast begot in Daemogorgons hall
And sawst the secrets of the world unmade 
Why suffredst thou thy Nephewes deare to fall
With Elfin sword most shamefully betrade

And him before I saw with bitter eyes
The bold Sansfoy shrinke underneath his speare 
And now the pray of fowles in field he lyes
Nor wayld of friends nor layd on groning beare
That whylome was to me too dearely deare
O what of Gods then boots it to be borne
If old Aveugles sonnes so evill heare 
Or who shall not great Nightes children scorne

Up then up dreary Dame of darknesse Queene
Go gather up the reliques of thy race
Or else goe them avenge and let be seene 
That dreaded Night in brightest day hath place
And can the children of faire light deface
Her feeling speeches some compassion moved
In hart and chaunge in that great mothers face
Yet pittie in her hart was never proved 

And said Deare daughter rightly may I rew
The fall of famous children borne of mee
And good successes which their foes ensew
But who can turne the streame of destinee 
Or breake the chayne of strong necessitee
Which fast is tyde to Joves eternall seat
The sonnes of Day he favoureth I see
And by my ruines thinkes to make them great

Yet shall they not escape so freely all
For some shall pay the price of others guilt
And he the man that made Sansfoy to fall
Shall with his owne bloud price that he has spilt
But what art thou that telst of Nephews kilt 
I that do seeme not I Duessa am
Quoth she how ever now in garments gilt
And gorgeous gold arrayd I to thee came

Then bowing downe her aged backe she kist 
The wicked witch saying In that faire face
The false resemblance of Deceipt I wist
Did closely lurke yet so true-seeming grace
It carried that I scarce in darkesome place
Could it discerne though I the mother bee 
Of falshood and roote of Duessaes race
O welcome child whom I have longd to see

Then to her yron wagon she betakes
And with her beares the fowle welfavourd witch 
Through mirkesome aire her readie way she makes
Her twyfold Teme of which two blacke as pitch
And two were browne yet each to each unlich
Did softly swim away ne ever stampe
Unlesse she chaunst their stubborne mouths to twitch 
Then foming tarre their bridles they would champe

So well they sped that they be come at length
Unto the place whereas the Paynim lay
Devoid of outward sense and native strength 
Coverd with charmed cloud from vew of day
And sight of men since his late luckelesse fray
His cruell wounds with cruddy bloud congeald
They binden up so wisely as they may
And handle softly till they can be healed 

And all the while she stood upon the ground
The wakefull dogs did never cease to bay
As giving warning of th' unwonted sound
With which her yron wheeles did them affray 
And her darke griesly looke them much dismay
The messenger of death the ghastly Owle
With drery shriekes did also her bewray
And hungry Wolves continually did howle

Thence turning backe in silence soft they stole
And brought the heavie corse with easie pace
To yawning gulfe of deepe Avernus hole
By that same hole an entrance darke and bace
With smoake and sulphure hiding all the place 
Descends to hell there creature never past
That backe returned without heavenly grace
But dreadfull Furies which their chaines have brast

By that same way the direfull dames doe drive 
Their mournefull charet fild with rusty blood
And downe to Plutoes house are come bilive
Which passing through on every side them stood
The trembling ghosts with sad amazed mood
Chattring their yron teeth and staring wide 
With stonie eyes and all the hellish brood
Of feends infernall flockt on every side

They pas the bitter waves of Acheron
Where many soules sit wailing woefully 
And come to fiery flood of Phlegeton
Whereas the damned ghosts in torments fry
And with sharpe shrilling shriekes doe bootlesse cry
Cursing high Jove the which them thither sent
The house of endlesse paine is built thereby 
In which ten thousand sorts of punishment

Before the threshold dreadfull Cerberus
His three deformed heads did lay along
Curled with thousand adders venemous 
And lilled forth his bloudie flaming tong
At them he gan to reare his bristles strong
And felly gnarre until Dayes enemy
Did him appease then downe his taile he hong
And suffred them to passen quietly 

There was Ixion turned on a wheele
For daring tempt the Queene of heaven to sin
And Sisyphus an huge round stone did reele
Against an hill ne might from labour lin 
There thirsty Tantalus hong by the chin
And Tityus fed a vulture on his maw
Typhoeus joynts were stretched on a gin
Theseus condemnd to endlesse slouth by law

They all beholding worldly wights in place
Leave off their worke unmindfull of their smart
To gaze on them who forth by them doe pace
Till they be come unto the furthest part
Where was a Cave ywrought by wondrous art 
Deepe darke uneasie dolefull comfortlesse
In which sad Aesculapius farre apart
Emprisond was in chaines remedilesse

Hippolytus a jolly huntsman was 
That wont in charett chace the foming Bore
He all his Peeres in beauty did surpas
But Ladies love as losse of time forbore
His wanton stepdame loved him the more
But when she saw her offred sweets refused 
Her love she turnd to hate and him before
His father fierce of treason false accused

Who all in rage his Sea-god syre besought
Some cursed vengeaunce on his sonne to cast 
From surging gulf two monsters straight were brought
With dread whereof his chasing steedes aghast
Both charet swift and huntsman overcast
His goodly corps on ragged cliffs yrent
Was quite dismembred and his members chast 
Scattered on every mountaine as he went

His cruell step-dame seeing what was donne
Her wicked dayes with wretched knife did end
In death avowing th' innocence of her sonne 
Which hearing his rash Syre began to rend
His haire and hastie tongue that did offend
Tho gathering up the relicks of his smart
By Dianes meanes who was Hippolyts frend
Them brought to Aesculape that by his art 

Such wondrous science in mans wit to raine
When Jove avizd that could the dead revive
And fates expired could renew againe
Of endlesse life he might him not deprive 
But unto hell did thrust him downe alive
With flashing thunderbolt ywounded sore
Where long remaining he did alwaies strive
Himselfe with salves to health for to restore

There auncient Night arriving did alight
From her nigh wearie waine and in her armes
To Aesculapius brought the wounded knight
Whom having softly disarayd of armes
Tho gan to him discover all his harmes 
Beseeching him with prayer and with praise
If either salves or oyles or herbes or charmes
A fordonne wight from dore of death mote raise

Ah Dame quoth he thou temptest me in vaine 
To dare the thing which daily yet I rew
And the old cause of my continued paine
With like attempt to like end to renew
Is not enough that thrust from heaven dew
Here endlesse penance for one fault I pay 
But that redoubled crime with vengeance new
Thou biddest me to eeke can Night defray

Not so quoth she but sith that heavens king
From hope of heaven hath thee excluded quight 
Why fearest thou that canst not hope for thing
And fearest not that more thee hurten might
Now in the powre of everlasting Night
Goe to then O thou farre renowmed sonne
Of great Apollo shew thy famous might 
In medicine that else hath to thee wonne

Her words prevaild And then the learned leach
His cunning hand gan to his wounds to lay
And all things else the which his art did teach 
Which having seene from thence arose away
The mother of dread darknesse and let stay
Aveugles sonne there in the leaches cure
And backe returning tooke her wonted way
To runne her timely race whilst Phoebus pure 

The false Duessa leaving noyous Night
Returnd to stately pallace of Dame Pride
Where when she came she found the Faery knight
Departed thence albe his woundes wide 
Not throughly heald unreadie were to ride
Good cause he had to hasten thence away
For on a day his wary Dwarfe had spide
Where in a dongeon deepe huge numbers lay

A ruefull sight as could be seene with eie
Of whom he learned had in secret wise
The hidden cause of their captivitie
How mortgaging their lives to Covetise
Through wastfull Pride and wanton Riotise 
They were by law of that proud Tyrannesse
Provokt with Wrath and Envies false surmise
Condemned to that Dongeon mercilesse

There was that great proud king of Babylon 
That would compell all nations to adore
And him as onely God to call upon
Till through celestiall doome throwne out of dore
Into an Oxe he was transform'd of yore
There also was king Croesus that enhaunst 
His hart too high through his great riches store
And proud Antiochus the which advaunst

And them long time before great Nimrod was
That first the world with sword and fire warrayd 
And after him old Ninus farre did pas
In princely pompe of all the world obayd
There also was that mightie Monarch layd
Low under all yet above all in pride
That name of native syre did fowle upbrayd 
And would as Ammons sonne be magnifide

All these together in one heape were throwne
Like carkases of beasts in butchers stall
And in another corner wide were strowne 
The antique ruines of the Romaines fall
Great Romulus the Grandsyre of them all
Proud Tarquin and too lordly Lentulus
Stout Scipio and stubborne Hanniball
Ambitious Sylla and sterne Marius 

Amongst these mightie men were wemen mixt
Proud wemen vaine forgetfull of their yoke
The bold Semiramis whose sides transfixt
With sonnes own blade her fowle reproches spoke 
Faire Sthenoboea that her selfe did choke
With wilfull cord for wanting of her will
High minded Cleopatra that with stroke
Of Aspes sting her selfe did stoutly kill

Besides the endlesse routs of wretched thralles
Which thither were assembled day by day
From all the world after their wofull falles
Through wicked pride and wasted wealthes decay
But most of all which in the Dongeon lay 
Fell from high Princes courts or Ladies bowres
Where they in idle pompe or wanton play
Consumed had their goods and thriftlesse howres

Whose case when as the carefull Dwarfe had tould 
And made ensample of their mournefull sight
Unto his maister he no lenger would
There dwell in perill of like painefull plight
But early rose and ere that dawning light
Discovered had the world to heaven wyde 
He by a privie Posterne tooke his flight
That of no envious eyes he mote be spyde

Scarse could he footing find in that fowle way
For many corses like a great Lay-stall 
Of murdred men which therein strowed lay
Without remorse or decent funerall
Which all through that great Princesse pride did fall
And came to shamefull end And them beside
Forth ryding underneath the castell wall 
A donghill of dead carkases he spide

As when a ship that flyes faire under saile
An hidden rocke escaped hath unwares
That lay in waite her wrack for to bewaile
The Marriner yet halfe amazed stares
At perill past and yet in doubt ne dares 
To joy at his foole-happie oversight
So doubly is distrest 'twixt joy and cares
The dreadlesse courage of this Elfin knight

Yet sad he was that his too hastie speede 
The faire Duess' had forst him leave behind
And yet more sad that Una his deare dreed
Her truth had staind with treason so unkind
Yet crime in her could never creature find
But for his love and for her owne selfe sake 
She wandred had from one to other Ynd
Him for to seeke ne ever would forsake

Who after Archimagoes fowle defeat
Led her away into a forest wilde 
And turning wrathfull fyre to lustfull heat
With beastly sin thought her to have defilde
And made the vassal of his pleasures wilde
Yet first he cast by treatie and by traynes
Her to persuade that stubborne fort to yilde 
For greater conquest of hard love he gaynes

With fawning words he courted her awhile
And looking lovely and oft sighing sore
Her constant hart did tempt with diverse guile 
But wordes and lookes and sighes she did abhore
As rocke of Diamond steadfast evermore
Yet for to feed his fyrie lustfull eye
He snatcht the vele that hong her face before
Then gan her beautie shyne as brightest skye 

So when he saw his flatt'ring artes to fayle
And subtile engines bett from batteree
With greedy force he gan the fort assayle
Whereof he weend possessed soone to bee 
And with rich spoile of ransackt chastitee
Ah heavens that do this hideous act behold
And heavenly virgin thus outraged see
How can ye vengeance just so long withold

The pitteous maiden carefull comfortlesse
Does throw out thrilling shriekes and shrieking cryes
The last vaine helpe of womens great distresse
And with loud plaints importuneth the skyes
That molten starres do drop like weeping eyes 
And Phoebus flying so most shameful sight
His blushing face in foggy cloud implyes
And hides for shame What wit of mortall wight

Eternal providence exceeding thought 
Where none appeares can make herselfe a way
A wondrous way it for this Lady wrought
From Lyons clawes to pluck the griped pray
Her shrill outcryes and shriekes so loud did bray
That all the woodes and forestes did resownd 
A troupe of Faunes and Satyres far away
Within the wood were dauncing in a rownd

Who when they heard that pitteous strained voice
In haste forsooke their rurall meriment 
And ran towards the far rebownded noyce
To weet what wight so loudly did lament
Unto the place they come incontinent
Whom when the raging Sarazin espide
A rude mishapen monstrous rablement 
Whose like he never saw he durst not bide

The wyld woodgods arrived in the place
There find the virgin dolefull desolate
With ruffled rayments and faire blubbred face 
As her outrageous foe had left her late
And trembling yet through feare of former hate
All stand amazed at so uncouth sight
And gin to pittie her unhappie state
All stand astonied at her beautie bright 

She more amaz'd in double dread doth dwell
And every tender part for feare doth shake
As when a greedie Wolfe through hunger fell
A seely Lambe farre from the flocke does take 
Of whom he meanes his bloudie feast to make
A Lyon spyes fast running towards him
The innocent pray in hast he does forsake
Which quit from death yet quakes in every lim

Such fearefull fit assaid her trembling hart
Ne word to speake ne joynt to move she had
The salvage nation feele her secret smart
And read her sorrow in her count'nance sad
Their frowning forheads with rough hornes yclad 
And rustick horror all a side doe lay
And gently grenning show a semblance glad
To comfort her and feare to put away

The doubtfull Damzell dare not yet commit 
Her single person to their barbarous truth
But still 'twixt feare and hope amazd does sit
Late learnd what harme to hasty trust ensu'th
They in compassion of her tender youth
And wonder of her beautie soveraine 
Are wonne with pitty and unwonted ruth
And all prostrate upon the lowly plaine

Their harts she ghesseth by their humble guise
And yieldes her to extremitie of time 
So from the ground she fearlesse doth arise
And walketh forth without suspect of crime
They all as glad as birdes of joyous Prime
Thence lead her forth about her dauncing round
Shouting and singing all a shepheards ryme 
And with greene braunches strowing all the ground

And all the way their merry pipes they sound
That all the woods with doubled Eccho ring
And with their horned feet do weare the ground 
Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant Spring
So towards old Sylvanus they her bring
Who with the noyse awaked commeth out
To weet the cause his weake steps governing
And aged limbs on Cypresse stadle stout 

Far off he wonders what them makes so glad
Or Bacchus merry fruit they did invent
Or Cybeles franticke rites have made them mad
They drawing nigh unto their God present 
That flowre of faith and beautie excellent
The God himselfe vewing that mirrhour rare
Stood long amazd and burnt in his intent
His owne faire Dryope now he thinkes not faire

The woodborne people fall before her flat
And worship her as Goddesse of the wood
And old Sylvanus selfe bethinkes not what
To thinke of wight so faire but gazing stood
In doubt to deeme her borne of earthly brood 
Sometimes Dame Venus selfe he seemes to see
But Venus never had so sober mood
Sometimes Diana he her takes to bee

By vew of her he ginneth to revive 
His ancient love and dearest Cyparisse
And calles to mind his pourtraiture alive
How faire he was and yet not faire to this
And how he slew with glauncing dart amisse
A gentle Hynd the which the lovely boy 
Did love as life above all worldly blisse
For griefe whereof the lad n'ould after joy

The wooddy Nymphes faire Hamadryades
Her to behold do thither runne apace 
And all the troupe of light-foot Naiades
Flocke all about to see her lovely face
But when they vewed have her heavenly grace
They envy her in their malitious mind
And fly away for feare of fowle disgrace 
But all the Satyres scorne their woody kind

Glad of such lucke the luckelesse lucky maid
Did her content to please their feeble eyes
And long time with that salvage people staid 
To gather breath in many miseries
During which time her gentle wit she plyes
To teach them truth which worshipt her in vaine
And made her th' Image of Idolatryes
But when their bootlesse zeale she did restraine 

It fortuned a noble warlike knight
By just occasion to that forrest came
To seeke his kindred and the lignage right
From whence he tooke his well deserved name 
He had in armes abroad wonne muchell fame
And fild far lands with glorie of his might
Plaine faithfull true and enimy of shame
And ever lov'd to fight for Ladies right

A Satyres sonne yborne in forrest wyld
By straunge adventure as it did betyde
And there begotten of a Lady myld
Faire Thyamis the daughter of Labryde
That was in sacred bands of wedlocke tyde 
To Therion a loose unruly swayne
Who had more joy to raunge the forrest wyde
And chase the salvage beast with busie payne

The forlorne mayd did with loves longing burne 
And could not lacke her lovers company
But to the wood she goes to serve her turne
And seeke her spouse that from her still does fly
And followes other game and venery
A Satyre chaunst her wandring for to finde 
 

So long in secret cabin there he held
 
Then home he suffred her for to retyre
For ransome leaving him the late borne childe
Whom till to ryper yeares he gan aspire 
He noursled up in life and manners wilde

For all he taught the tender ymp was but
To banish cowardize and bastard feare
His trembling hand he would him force to put 
Upon the Lyon and the rugged Beare
And from the she Beares teats her whelps to teare
And eke wyld roaring Buls he would him make
To tame and ryde their backes not made to beare
And the Robuckes in flight to overtake 

Thereby so fearlesse and so fell he grew
That his owne sire and maister of his guise
Did often tremble at his horrid vew
And oft for dread of hurt would him advise 
The angry beasts not rashly to despise
Nor too much to provoke for he would learne
The Lyon stoup to him in lowly wise
A lesson hard and make the Libbard sterne

And for to make his powre approved more
Wyld beasts in yron yokes he would compell
The spotted Panther and the tusked Bore
The Pardale swift and the tigre cruell
The Antelope and Wolfe both fierce and fell 
And them constraine in equall teme to draw
Such joy he had their stubborne harts to quell
And sturdie courage tame with dreadfull aw

His loving mother came upon a day 
Unto the woods to see her little sonne
And chaunst unwares to meet him in the way
After his sportes and cruell pastime donne
When after him a Lyonesse did runne
That roaring all with rage did lowd requere 
Her children deare whom he away had wonne
The Lyon whelpes she saw how he did beare

The fearefull Dame all quaked at the sight
And turning backe gan fast to fly away 
Untill with love revokt from vaine affright
She hardly yet perswaded was to stay
And then to him these womanish words gan say
Ah Satyrane my dearling and my joy
For love of me leave off this dreadfull play 
To dally thus with death is no fit toy

In these and like delights of bloudy game
He trayned was till ryper yeares he raught
And there abode whilst any beast of name 
Walkt in that forest whom he had not taught
To feare his force and then his courage haught
Desird of forreine foemen to be knowne
And far abroad for straunge adventures sought
In which his might was never overthrowne 

Yet evermore it was his manner faire
After long labours and adventures spent
Unto those native woods for to repaire
To see his sire and offspring auncient 
And now he thither came for like intent
Where he unwares the fairest Una found
Straunge Lady in so straunge habiliment
Teaching the Satyres which her sat around

He wondred at her wisedome heavenly rare
Whose like in womens wit he never knew
And when her curteous deeds he did compare
Gan her admire and her sad sorrowes rew
Blaming of Fortune which such troubles threw 
And joyd to make proofe of her crueltie
On gentle Dame so hurtlesse and so trew
Thenceforth he kept her goodly company

But she all vowd unto the Redcrosse knight 
His wandring perill closely did lament
Ne in this new acquaintaunce could delight
But her deare heart with anguish did torment
And all her wit in secret counsels spent
How to escape At last in privie wise 
To Satyrane she shewed her intent
Who glad to gain such favour gan devise

So on a day when Satyres all were gone
To do their service to Sylvanus old 
The gentle virgin left behind alone
He led away with courage stout and bold
Too late it was to Satyres to be told
Or ever hope recover her againe
In vaine he seekes that having cannot hold 
So fast he carried her with carefull paine

The better part now of the lingring day
They traveild had whenas they farre espide
A weary wight forwandring by the way 
And towards him they gan in haste to ride
To weete of newes that did abroad betide
Or tydings of her knight of the Redcrosse
But he them spying gan to turne aside
For feare as seemd or for some feigned losse 

A silly man in simple weedes forworne
And soild with dust of the long dried way
His sandales were with toilsome travell torne
And face all tand with scorching sunny ray 
As he had traveild many a sommers day
Through boyling sands of Arabie and Ynde
And in his hand a Jacobs staffe to stay
His wearie limbes upon and eke behind

The knight approaching nigh of him inquerd
Tidings of warre and of adventures new
But warres nor new adventures none he herd
Then Una gan to aske if ought he knew
Or heard abroad of that her champion trew 
That in his armour bare a croslet red
Aye me Deare dame quoth he well may I rew
To tell the sad sight which mine eies have red

That cruell word her tender hart so thrild 
That suddein cold did runne through every vaine
And stony horrour all her sences fild
With dying fit that downe she fell for paine
The knight her lightly reared up againe
And comforted with curteous kind reliefe 
Then wonne from death she bad him tellen plaine
The further processe of her hidden griefe

Then gan the Pilgrim thus I chaunst this day
This fatall day that shall I ever rew 
To see two knights in travell on my way
A sory sight arraung'd in battell new
Both breathing vengeaunce both of wrathfull hew
My fearefull flesh did tremble at their strife
To see their blades so greedily imbrew 
That drunke with bloud yet thristed after life

Ah dearest Lord quoth she how might that bee
And he the stoughtest knight that ever wonne
Ah dearest dame quoth he how might I see 
The thing that might not be and yet was donne
Where is said Satyrane that Paynims sonne
That him of life and us of joy hath reft
Not far away quoth he he hence doth wonne
Foreby a fountaine where I late him left 

Therewith the knight thence marched forth in hast
Whiles Una with huge heavinesse opprest
Could not for sorrow follow him so fast
And soone he came as he the place had ghest 
Whereas that Pagan proud him selfe did rest
In secret shadow by a fountaine side
Even he it was that earst would have supprest
Faire Una whom when Satyrane espide

And said Arise thou cursed Miscreaunt
That hast with knightlesse guile and trecherous train
Faire knighthood fowly shamed and doest vaunt
That good knight of the Redcrosse to have slain
Arise and with like treason now maintain 
Thy guilty wrong or els thee guilty yield
The Sarazin this hearing rose amain
And catching up in hast his three-square shield

And drawing nigh him said Ah misborne Elfe 
In evill houre thy foes thee hither sent
Anothers wrongs to wreake upon thy selfe
Yet ill thou blamest me for having blent
My name with guile and traiterous intent
That Redcrosse knight perdie I never slew 
But had he beene where earst his arms were lent
Th' enchaunter vaine his errour should not rew

Therewith they gan both furious and fell
To thunder blowes and fiersly to assaile 
Each other bent his enimy to quell
That with their force they perst both plate and maile
And made wide furrowes in their fleshes fraile
That it would pitty any living eie
Large floods of bloud adowne their sides did raile 
But floods of bloud could not them satisfie

So long they fight and fell revenge pursue
That fainting each themselves to breathen let
And oft refreshed battell oft renue 
As when two Bores with rancling malice met
Their gory sides fresh bleeding fiercely fret
Til breathlesse both them selves aside retire
Where foming wrath their cruell tuskes they whet
And trample th' earth the whiles they may respire 

So fiersly when these knights had breathed once
They gan to fight returne increasing more
Their puissant force and cruell rage attonce
With heaped strokes more hugely then before 
That with their drerie wounds and bloudy gore
They both deformed scarsely could be known
By this sad Una fraught with anguish sore
Led with their noise which through the aire was thrown

Whom all so soone as that proud Sarazin
Espide he gan revive the memory
Of his lewd lusts and late attempted sin
And left the doubtfull battell hastily
To catch her newly offred to his eie 
But Satyrane with strokes him turning staid
And sternely bad him other businesse plie
Then hunt the steps of pure unspotted Maid

O foolish faeries son what fury mad 
Hath thee incenst to hast thy doefull fate
Were it not better I that Lady had
Then that thou hadst repented it too late
Most senseless man he that himselfe doth hate
To love another Lo then for thine ayd 
Here take thy lovers token on thy pate
So they two fight the whiles the royall Mayd

But that false Pilgrim which that leasing told
Being in deed old Archimage did stay 
In secret shadow all this to behold
And much rejoiced in their bloudy fray
But when he saw the Damsell passe away
He left his stond and her pursewd apace
In hope to bring her to her last decay 
But for to tell her lamentable cace

What man so wise what earthly wit so ware
As to discry the crafty cunning traine
By which deceipt doth maske in visour faire
And cast her colours dyed deepe in graine
To seeme like Truth whose shape she well can faine 
And fitting gestures to her purpose frame
The guiltlesse man with guile to entertaine
Great maistresse of her art was that false Dame

Who when returning from the drery Night 
She fownd not in that perilous house of Pryde
Where she had left the noble Redcrosse knight
Her hoped pray she would no lenger bide
But forth she went to seeke him far and wide
Ere long she fownd whereas he wearie sate 
To rest him selfe foreby a fountaine side
Disarmed all of yron-coted Plate

He feedes upon the cooling shade and bayes
His sweatie forehead in the breathing wind 
Which through the trembling leaves full gently playes
Wherein the cherefull birds of sundry kind
Do chaunt sweet musick to delight his mind
The Witch approaching gan him fairely greet
And with reproch of carelesnesse unkind 
Upbrayd for leaving her in place unmeet

Unkindnesse past they gan of solace treat
And bathe in pleasaunce of the joyous shade
Which shielded them against the boyling heat 
And with greene boughes decking a gloomy glade
About the fountaine like a girlond made
Whose bubbling wave did ever freshly well
Ne ever would through fervent sommer fade
The sacred Nymph which therein wont to dwell 

The cause was this One day when Phoebe fayre
With all her band was following the chace
This Nymph quite tyr'd with heat of scorching ayre
Sat downe to rest in middest of the race 
The goddesse wroth gan fowly her disgrace
And bad the waters which from her did flow
Be such as she her selfe was then in place
Thenceforth her waters waxed dull and slow

Hereof this gentle knight unweeting was
And lying downe upon the sandie graile
Drunke of the streame as cleare as cristall glas
Eftsoones his manly forces gan to faile
And mightie strong was turned to feeble fraile 
His chaunged powres at first them selves not felt
Till crudled cold his corage gan assaile
And cheareful bloud in faintnesse chill did melt

Yet goodly court he made still to his Dame 
Pourd out in loosnesse on the grassy grownd
Both carelesse of his health and of his fame
Till at the last he heard a dreadfull sownd
Which through the wood loud bellowing did rebownd
That all the earth for terrour seemd to shake 
And trees did tremble Th' Elfe therewith astownd
Upstarted lightly from his looser make

But ere he could his armour on him dight
Or get his shield his monstrous enimy 
With sturdie steps came stalking in his sight
An hideous Geant horrible and hye
That with his tallnesse seemd to threat the skye
The ground eke groned under him for dreed
His living like saw never living eye 
Ne durst behold his stature did exceed

The greatest Earth his uncouth mother was
And blustering Aeolus his boasted syre
 
Brought forth this monstrous masse of earthly slime 

So growen great through arrogant delight
Of th' high descent whereof he was yborne
And through presumption of his matchlesse might
All other powres and knighthood he did scorne 
Such now he marcheth to this man forlorne
And left to losse his stalking steps are stayde
Upon a snaggy Oke which he had torne
Out of his mothers bowelles and it made

That when the knight he spide he gan advance
With huge force and insupportable mayne
And towardes him with dreadfull fury praunce
Who haplesse and eke hopelesse all in vaine
Did to him pace sad battaile to darrayne 
Disarmd disgrast and inwardly dismayde
And eke so faint in every joynt and vaine
Through that fraile fountaine which him feeble made

The Geaunt strooke so maynly mercilesse 
That could have overthrowne a stony towre
And were not heavenly grace that did him blesse
He had beene pouldred all as thin as flowre
But he was wary of that deadly stowre
And lightly lept from underneath the blow 
Yet so exceeding was the villeins powre
That with the wind it did him overthrow

As when that divelish yron Engin wrought
In deepest Hell and framd by Furies skill 
With windy Nitre and quick Sulphur fraught
And ramd with bullet round ordaind to kill
Conceiveth fire the heavens it doth fill
With thundring noyse and all the ayre doth choke
That none can breath nor see nor heare at will 
Through smouldry cloud of duskish stincking smoke

So daunted when the Geaunt saw the knight
His heavie hand he heaved up on hye
And him to dust thought to have battred quight 
Untill Duessa loud to him gan crye
O great Orgoglio greatest under skye
O hold thy mortall hand for Ladies sake
Hold for my sake and do him not to dye
But vanquisht thine eternall bondslave make 

He hearkned and did stay from further harmes
To gayne so goodly guerdon as she spake
So willingly she came into his armes
Who her as willingly to grace did take 
And was possessed of his new found make
Then up he tooke the slombred sencelesse corse
And ere he could out of his swowne awake
Him to his castle brought with hastie forse

From that day forth Duessa was his deare
And highly honourd in his haughtie eye
He gave her gold and purple pall to weare
And triple crowne set on her head full hye
And her endowd with royall majestye 
Then for to make her dreaded more of men
And peoples harts with awfull terrour tye
A monstrous beast ybred in filthy fen

Such one it was as that renowmed Snake 
Which great Alcides in Stremona slew
Long fostred in the filth of Lerna lake
Whose many heads out budding ever new
Did breed him endlesse labour to subdew
But this same Monster much more ugly was 
For seven great heads out of his body grew
An yron brest and back of scaly bras

His tayle was stretched out in wondrous length
That to the house of heavenly gods it raught 
And with extorted powre and borrow'd strength
The ever-burning lamps from thence it braught
And prowdly threw to ground as things of naught
And underneath his filthy feet did tread
The sacred things and holy heasts foretaught 
Upon this dreadfull Beast with sevenfold head

The wofull Dwarfe which saw his maisters fall
Whiles he had keeping of his grasing steed
And valiant knight become a caytive thrall 
When all was past tooke up his forlorne weed
His mightie armour missing most at need
His silver shield now idle maisterlesse
His poynant speare that many made to bleed
The rueful moniments of heavinesse 

He had not travaild long when on the way
He wofull Ladie wofull Una met
Fast flying from that Paynims greedy pray
Whilest Satyrane him from pursuit did let 
Who when her eyes she on the Dwarfe had set
And saw the signes that deadly tydings spake
She fell to ground for sorrowfull regret
And lively breath her sad brest did forsake

The messenger of so unhappie newes
Would faine have dyde dead was his hart within
Yet outwardly some little comfort shewes
At last recovering hart he does begin
To rub her temples and to chaufe her chin 
And everie tender part does tosse and turne
So hardly he the flitted life does win
Unto her native prison to retourne

Ye dreary instruments of dolefull sight 
That doe this deadly spectacle behold
Why do ye lenger feed on loathed light
Or liking find to gaze on earthly mould
Sith cruell fates the carefull threeds unfould
The which my life and love together tyde 
Now let the stony dart of senselesse cold
Perce to my hart and pas through every side

O lightsome day the lampe of highest Jove
First made by him mens wandring wayes to guyde 
When darkenesse he in deepest dongeon drove
Henceforth thy hated face for ever hyde
And shut up heavens windowes shyning wyde
For earthly sight can nought but sorrow breed
And late repentance which shall long abyde 
Mine eyes no more on vanitie shall feed

Then downe againe she fell unto the ground
But he her quickly reared up againe
Thrise did she sinke adowne in deadly swownd 
And thrise he her reviv'd with busie paine
At last when life recover'd had the raine
And over-wrestled his strong enemie
With foltring tong and trembling every vaine
Tell on quoth she the wofull Tragedie 

Tempestuous fortune hath spent all her spight
And thrilling sorrow throwne his utmost dart
Thy sad tongue cannot tell more heavy plight
Then that I feele and harbour in mine hart 
Who hath endur'd the whole can beare each part
If death it be it is not the first wound
That launched hath my brest with bleeding smart
Begin and end the bitter balefull stound

Then gan the Dwarfe the whole discourse declare
The subtill traines of Archimago old
The wanton loves of false Fidessa faire
Bought with the blood of vanquisht Paynim bold
The wretched payre transformed to treen mould 
The house of Pride and perils round about
The combat which he with Sansjoy did hould
The lucklesse conflict with the Gyant stout

She heard with patience all unto the end 
And strove to maister sorrowfull assay
Which greater grew the more she did contend
And almost rent her tender hart in tway
And love fresh coles unto her fire did lay
For greater love the greater is the losse 
Was never Lady loved dearer day
Then she did love the knight of the Redcrosse

At last when fervent sorrow slaked was
She up arose resolving him to find 
Alive or dead and forward forth doth pas
All as the Dwarfe the way to her assynd
And evermore in constant carefull mind
She fed her wound with fresh renewed bale
Long tost with stormes and bet with bitter wind 
High over hills and low adowne the dale

At last she chaunced by good hap to meet
A goodly knight faire marching by the way
Together with his Squire arrayed meet 
His glitterand armour shined farre away
Like glauncing light of Phoebus brightest ray
From top to toe no place appeared bare
That deadly dint of steele endanger may
Athwart his brest a bauldrick brave he ware 

And in the midst thereof one pretious stone
Of wondrous worth and eke of wondrous mights
Shapt like a Ladies head exceeding shone
Like Hesperus emongst the lesser lights 
And strove for to amaze the weaker sights
Thereby his mortall blade full comely hong
In yvory sheath ycarv'd with curious slights
Whose hilts were burnisht gold and handle strong

His haughtie helmet horrid all with gold
Both glorious brightnesse and great terrour bred
For all the crest a Dragon did enfold
With greedie pawes and over all did spred
His golden wings his dreadfull hideous hed 
Close couched on the bever seem'd to throw
From flaming mouth bright sparkles fierie red
That suddeine horror to faint harts did show

Upon the top of all his loftie crest 
A bunch of haires discolourd diversly
With sprincled pearle and gold full richly drest
Did shake and seemd to daunce for jollity
Like to an Almond tree ymounted hye
On top of greene Selinis all alone 
With blossoms brave bedecked daintily
Whose tender locks do tremble every one

His warlike shield all closely cover'd was
Ne might of mortall eye be ever seene 
Not made of steele nor of enduring bras
Such earthly mettals soone consumed beene
But all of Diamond perfect pure and cleene
It framed was one massie entire mould
Hewen out of Adamant rocke with engines keene 
That point of speare it never percen could

The same to wight he never wont disclose
But when as monsters huge he would dismay
Or daunt unequall armies of his foes 
Or when the flying heavens he would affray
For so exceeding shone his glistring ray
That Phoebus golden face it did attaint
As when a cloud his beames doth over-lay
And silver Cynthia wexed pale and faint 

No magicke arts hereof had any might
Nor bloudie wordes of bold Enchaunters call
But all that was not such as seemd in sight
Before that shield did fade and suddeine fall 
And when him list the raskall routes appall
Men into stones therewith he could transmew
And stones to dust and dust to nought at all
And when him list the prouder lookes subdew

Ne let it seeme that credence this exceedes
For he that made the same was knowne right well
To have done much more admirable deedes
It Merlin was which whylome did excell
All living wightes in might of magicke spell 
Both shield and sword and armour all he wrought
For this young Prince when first to armes he fell
But when he dyde the Faerie Queene it brought

A gentle youth his dearely loved Squire 
His speare of heben wood behind him bare
Whose harmefull head thrice heated in the fire
Had riven many a brest with pikehead square
A goodly person and could menage faire
His stubborne steed with curbed canon bit 
Who under him did trample as the aire
And chauft that any on his backe should sit

When as this knight nigh to the Ladie drew
With lovely court he gan her entertaine 
But when he heard her answeres loth he knew
Some secret sorrow did her heart distraine
Which to allay and calme her storming paine
Faire feeling words he wisely gan display
And for her humour fitting purpose faine 
To tempt the cause it selfe for to bewray

What worlds delight or joy of living speach
Can heart so plung'd in sea of sorrowes deep
And heaped with so huge misfortunes reach 
The carefull cold beginneth for to creepe
And in my heart his yron arrow steepe
Soone as I thinke upon my bitter bale
Such helplesse harmes yts better hidden keepe
Then rip up griefe where it may not availe 

Ah Ladie deare quoth then the gentle knight
Well may I weene your griefe is wondrous great
For wondrous great griefe groneth in my spright
Whiles thus I heare you of your sorrowes treat 
But wofull Ladie let me you intrete
For to unfold the anguish of your hart
Mishaps are maistred by advice discrete
And counsell mittigates the greatest smart

O but quoth she great griefe will not be tould
And can more easily be thought then said
Right so quoth he but he that never would
Could never will to might gives greatest aid
But griefe quoth she does greater grow displaid 
If then it find not helpe and breedes despaire
Despaire breedes not quoth he where faith is staid
No faith so fast quoth she but flesh does paire

His goodly reason and well guided speach 
So deepe did settle in her gracious thought
That her perswaded to disclose the breach
Which love and fortune in her heart had wrought
And said Faire Sir I hope good hap hath brought
You to inquire the secrets of my griefe 
Or that your wisedome will direct my thought
Or that your prowesse can me yield reliefe

The forlorne Maiden whom your eyes have seene
The laughing stocke of fortunes mockeries 
Am th' only daughter of a King and Queene
Whose parents deare whilest equal destinies
Did runne about and their felicities
The favourable heavens did not envy
Did spread their rule through all the territories 
Which Phison and Euphrates floweth by

Till that their cruell cursed enemy
An huge great Dragon horrible in sight
Bred in the loathly lakes of Tartary 
With murdrous ravine and devouring might
Their kingdome spoild and countrey wasted quight
Themselves for feare into his jawes to fall
He forst to castle strong to take their flight
Where fast embard in mighty brasen wall 

Full many knights adventurous and stout
Have enterpriz'd that Monster to subdew
From every coast that heaven walks about
Have thither come the noble Martiall crew 
That famous hard atchievements still pursew
Yet never any could that girlond win
But all still shronke and still he greater grew
All they for want of faith or guilt of sin

At last yledd with farre reported praise
Which flying fame throughout the world had spred
Of doughty knights whom Faery land did raise
That noble order hight of Maidenhed
Forthwith to court of Gloriane I sped 
Of Gloriane great Queene of glory bright
Whose Kingdomes seat Cleopolis is red
There to obtaine some such redoubted knight

It was my chance my chance was faire and good 
There for to find a fresh unproved knight
Whose manly hands imbrew'd in guiltie blood
Had never bene ne ever by his might
Had throwne to ground the unregarded right
Yet of his prowesse proofe he since hath made 
I witnesse am in many a cruell fight
The groning ghosts of many one dismaide

And ye the forlorne reliques of his powre
His byting sword and his devouring speare 
Which have endured many a dreadfull stowre
Can speake his prowesse that did earst you beare
And well could rule now he hath left you heare
To be the record of his ruefull losse
And of my dolefull disaventurous deare 
O heavie record of the good Redcrosse

Well hoped I and faire beginnings had
That he my captive languor should redeeme
Till all unweeting an Enchaunter bad 
His sence abusd and made him to misdeeme
My loyalty not such as it did seeme
That rather death desire then such despight
Be judge ye heavens that all things right esteeme
How I him lov'd and love with all my might 

Thenceforth me desolate he quite forsooke
To wander where wilde fortune would me lead
And other bywaies he himselfe betooke
Where never foot of living wight did tread 
That brought not backe the balefull body dead
In which him chaunced false Duessa meete
Mine onely foe mine onely deadly dread
Who with her witchcraft and misseeming sweete

At last by subtill sleights she him betraid
Unto his foe a Gyant huge and tall
Who him disarmed dissolute dismaid
Unwares surprised and with mighty mall
The monster mercilesse him made to fall 
Whose fall did never foe before behold
And now in darkesome dungeon wretched thrall
Remedilesse for aie he doth him hold

Ere she had ended all she gan to faint 
But he her comforted and faire bespake
Certes Madame ye have great cause of plaint
The stoutest heart I weene could cause to quake
But be of cheare and comfort to you take
For till I have acquit your captive knight 
Assure your selfe I will you not forsake
His chearefull wordes reviv'd her chearelesse spright

Ay me how many perils doe enfold
The righteous man to make him daily fall
Were not that heavenly grace doth him uphold
And stedfast truth acquite him out of all
Her love is firme her care continuall 
So oft as he through his owne foolish pride
Or weaknesse is to sinfull bands made thrall
Else should this Redcrosse knight in bands have dydd

They sadly traveild thus until they came 
Nigh to a castle builded strong and hie
Then cryde the Dwarfe Lo yonder is the same
In which my Lord my liege doth lucklesse lie
Thrall to that Gyants hateful tyrannie
Therefore deare Sir your mightie powres assay 
The noble knight alighted by and by
From loftie steede and bad the Ladie stay

So with the Squire th' admirer of his might
He marched forth towards that castle wall 
Whose gates he found fast shut ne living wight
To ward the same nor answere commers call
Then tooke that Squire an horne of bugle small
Which hong adowne his side in twisted gold
And tassels gay Wyde wonders over all 
Of that same hornes great vertues weren told

Was never wight that heard that shrilling sownd
But trembling feare did feel in every vaine
Three miles it might be easie heard around 
And Ecchoes three answerd it selfe againe
No false enchauntment nor deceiptfull traine
Might once abide the terror of that blast
But presently was voide and wholly vaine
No gate so strong no locke so firme and fast 

The same before the Geants gate he blew
That all the castle quaked from the ground
And every dore of freewill open flew
The Gyant selfe dismaied with that sownd 
Where he with his Duessa dalliance fownd
In hast came rushing forth from inner bowre
With staring countenance sterne as one astownd
And staggering steps to weet what suddein stowre

And after him the proud Duessa came
High mounted on her many-headed beast
And every head with fyrie tongue did flame
And every head was crowned on his creast
And bloody mouthed with late cruell feast 
That when the knight beheld his mightie shild
Upon his manly arme he soone addrest
And at him fiercely flew with courage fild

Therewith the Gyant buckled him to fight 
Inflam'd with scornefull wrath and high disdaine
And lifting up his dreadfull club on hight
All arm'd with ragged snubbes and knottie graine
Him thought at first encounter to have slaine
But wise and wary was that noble Pere 
And lightly leaping from so monstrous maine
Did faire avoide the violence him nere

Ne shame he thought to shunne so hideous might
The idle stroke enforcing furious way 
Missing the marke of his misaymed sight
Did fall to ground and with his heavie sway
So deepely dinted in the driven clay
That three yardes deepe a furrow up did throw
The sad earth wounded with so sore assay 
Did grone full grievous underneath the blow

As when almightie Jove in wrathfull mood
To wreake the guilt of mortall sins is bent
Hurles forth his thundring dart with deadly food 
Enrold in flames and smouldring dreriment
Through riven cloudes and molten firmament
The fierce threeforked engin making way
Both loftie towres and highest trees hath rent
And all that might his angry passage stay 

His boystrous club so buried in the ground
He could not rearen up againe so light
But that the knight him at avantage found
And whiles he strove his combred clubbe to quight 
Out of the earth with blade all burning bright
He smote off his left arme which like a blocke
Did fall to ground depriv'd of native might
Large streames of bloud out of the truncked stocke

Dismayed with so desperate deadly wound
And eke impatient of unwonted paine
He lowdly brayd with beastly yelling sound
That all the fields rebellowed againe
As great a noyse as when in Cymbrian plaine 
An heard of Bulles whom kindly rage doth sting
Do for the milkie mothers want complaine
And fill the fields with troublous bellowing

That when his deare Duessa heard and saw 
The evil stownd that daungerd her estate
Unto his aide she hastily did draw
Her dreadfull beast who swolne with blood of late
Came ramping forth with proud presumpteous gate
And threatned all his heads like flaming brands 
But him the Squire made quickly to retrate
Encountring fierce with single sword in hand

The proud Duessa full of wrathfull spight
And fierce disdaine to be affronted so 
Enforst her purple beast with all her might
That stop out of the way to overthroe
Scorning the let of so unequall foe
But nathemore would that courageous swayne
To her yeeld passage gainst his Lord to goe 
But with outrageous strokes did him restraine

Then tooke the angrie witch her golden cup
Which still she bore replete with magick artes
Death and despeyre did many thereof sup 
And secret poyson through their inner parts
Th' eternall bale of heavie wounded harts
Which after charmes and some enchauntments said
She lightly sprinkled on his weaker parts
Therewith his sturdie courage soone was quayd 

So downe he fell before the cruell beast
Who on his neck his bloody clawes did seize
That life nigh crusht out of his panting brest
No powre he had to stirre nor will to rize 
That when the carefull knight gan well avise
He lightly left the foe with whom he fought
And to the beast gan turne his enterprise
For wondrous anguish in his hart it wrought

And high advauncing his blood-thirstie blade
Stroke one of those deformed heads so sore
That of his puissance proud ensample made
His monstrous scalpe downe to his teeth it tore
And that misformed shape mis-shaped more 
A sea of blood gusht from the gaping wound
That her gay garments staynd with filthy gore
And overflowed all the field around

Thereat he roared for exceeding paine 
That to have heard great horror would have bred
And scourging th' emptie ayre with his long traine
Through great impatience of his grieved hed
His gorgeous ryder from her loftie sted
Would have cast downe and trod in durtie myre 
Had not the Gyant soone her succoured
Who all enrag'd with smart and franticke yre

The force which wont in two to be disperst
In one alone left hand he now unites 
Which is through rage more strong than both were erst
With which his hideous club aloft he dites
And at his foe with furious rigour smites
That strongest Oake might seeme to overthrow
The stroke upon his shield so heavie lites 
That to the ground it doubleth him full low

And in his fall his shield that covered was
Did loose his vele by chaunce and open flew
The light whereof that heavens light did pas 
Such blazing brightnesse through the aier threw
That eye mote not the same endure to vew
Which when the Gyaunt spyde with staring eye
He downe let fall his arme and soft withdrew
His weapon huge that heaved was on hye 

And eke the fruitfull-headed beast amazd
At flashing beames of that sunshiny shield
Became starke blind and all his sences daz'd
That downe he tumbled on the durtie field 
And seem'd himselfe as conquered to yield
Whom when his maistresse proud perceiv'd to fall
Whiles yet his feeble feet for faintnesse reeld
Unto the Gyant loudly she gan call

At her so pitteous cry was much amoov'd
Her champion stout and for to ayde his frend
Againe his wonted angry weapon proov'd
But all in vaine for he has read his end
In that bright shield and all their forces spend 
Themselves in vaine for since that glauncing sight
He had no powre to hurt nor to defend
As where th' Almighties lightning brond does light

Whom when the Prince to battell new addrest 
And threatning high his dreadfull stroke did see
His sparkling blade about his head he blest
And smote off quite his right leg by the knee
That downe he tombled as an aged tree
High growing on the top of rocky clift 
Whose hartstrings with keene steele nigh hewen be
The mightie trunck halfe rent with ragged rift

Or as a Castle reared high and round
By subtile engins and malitious slight 
Is undermined from the lowest ground
And her foundation forst and feebled quight
At last downe falles and with her heaped hight
Her hastie ruine does more heavie make
And yields it selfe unto the victours might 
Such was this Gyants fall that seemd to shake

The knight then lightly leaping to the pray
With mortall steele him smot againe so sore
That headlesse his unweldy bodie lay 
All wallowd in his owne fowle bloudy gore
Which flowed from his wounds in wondrous store
But soone as breath out of his breast did pas
That huge great body which the Gyaunt bore
Was vanisht quite and of that monstrous mas 

Whose grievous fall when false Duessa spide
Her golden cup she cast unto the ground
And crowned mitre rudely threw aside
Such percing griefe her stubborne hart did wound 
That she could not endure that dolefull stound
But leaving all behind her fled away
The light-foot Squire her quickly turnd around
And by hard meanes enforcing her to stay

The royall Virgin which beheld from farre
In pensive plight and sad perplexitie
The whole atchievement of this doubtfull warre
Came running fast to greet his victorie
With sober gladnesse and myld modestie 
And with sweet joyous cheare him thus bespake
Faire braunch of noblesse flowre of chevalrie
That with your worth the world amazed make

And you fresh budd of vertue springing fast 
Whom these sad eyes saw nigh unto deaths dore
What hath poore Virgin for such perill past
Wherewith you to reward Accept therefore
My simple selfe and service evermore
And he that high does sit and all things see 
With equall eyes their merites to restore
Behold what ye this day have done for mee

But sith the heavens and your faire handeling
Have made you master of the field this day 
Your fortune maister eke with governing
And well begun end all so well I pray
Ne let that wicked woman scape away
For she it is that did my Lord bethrall
My dearest Lord and deepe in dongeon lay 
Where he his better dayes hath wasted all

Forthwith he gave in charge unto his Squire
That scarlot whore to keepen carefully
Whiles he himselfe with greedie great desire 
Into the Castle entred forcibly
Where living creature none he did espye
Then gan he lowdly through the house to call
But no man car'd to answere to his crye
There raignd a solemne silence over all 

At last with creeping crooked pace forth came
An old old man with beard as white as snow
That on a staffe his feeble steps did frame
And guide his wearie gate both to and fro 
For his eye sight him failed long ygo
And on his arme a bounch of keyes he bore
The which unused rust did overgrow
Those were the keyes of every inner dore

But very uncouth sight was to behold
How he did fashion his untoward pace
For as he forward moov'd his footing old
So backward still was turnd his wrincled face
Unlike to men who ever as they trace 
Both feet and face one way are wont to lead
This was the auncient keeper of that place
And foster father of the Gyant dead

His reverend haires and holy gravitie 
The knight much honord as beseemed well
And gently askt where all the people bee
Which in that stately building wont to dwell
Who answerd him full soft he could not tell
Again he askt where that same knight was layd 
Whom great Orgoglio with his puissance fell
Had made his caytive thrall againe he sayde

Then asked he which way he in might pas
He could not tell againe he answered 
Thereat the curteous knight displeased was
And said Old sire it seemes thou hast not red
How ill it sits with that same silver hed
In vaine to mocke or mockt in vaine to bee
But if thou be as thou art pourtrahed 
With natures pen in ages grave degree

His answere likewise was he could not tell
Whose sencelesse speach and doted ignorance
When as the noble Prince had marked well 
He ghest his nature by his countenance
And calmd his wrath with goodly temperance
Then to him stepping from his arme did reach
Those keyes and made himselfe free enterance
Each dore he opened without any breach 

There all within full rich arrayd he found
With royall arras and resplendent gold
And did with store of every thing abound
That greatest Princes presence might behold 
But all the floore too filthy to be told
With bloud of guiltlesse babes and innocents trew
Which there were slaine as sheepe out of the fold
Defiled was that dreadfull was to vew

And there beside of marble stone was built
An Altare carv'd with cunning ymagery
On which true Christians bloud was often spilt
And holy Martyrs often doen to dye
With cruell malice and strong tyranny 
Whose blessed sprites from underneath the stone
To God for vengeance cryde continually
And with great griefe were often heard to grone

Through every rowme he sought and every bowr 
But no where could he find that woful thrall
At last he came unto an yron doore
That fast was lockt but key found not at all
Emongst that bounch to open it withall
But in the same a little grate was pight 
Through which he sent his voyce and lowd did call
With all his powre to weet if living wight

Therewith an hollow dreary murmuring voyce
These pitteous plaints and dolours did resound 
O who is that which brings me happy choyce
Of death that here lye dying every stound
Yet live perforce in balefull darkenesse bound
For now three Moones have changed thrice their hew
And have been thrice hid underneath the ground 
Since I the heavens chearfull face did vew

Which when that Champion heard with percing point
Of pitty deare his hart was thrilled sore
And trembling horrour ran through every joynt 
For ruth of gentle knight so fowle forlore
Which shaking off he rent that yron dore
With furious force and indignation fell
Where entred in his foot could find no flore
But all a deepe descent as darke as hell 

But neither darkenesse fowle nor filthy bands
Nor noyous smell his purpose could withhold
Entire affection hateth nicer hands
But that with constant zeale and courage bold 
After long paines and labours manifold
He found the meanes that Prisoner up to reare
Whose feeble thighes unhable to uphold
His pined corse him scarse to light could beare

His sad dull eyes deepe sunck in hollow pits
Could not endure th' unwonted sunne to view
His bare thin cheekes for want of better bits
And empty sides deceived of their dew
Could make a stony hart his hap to rew 
His rawbone armes whose mighty brawned bowrs
Were wont to rive steele plates and helmets hew
Were cleane consum'd and all his vitall powres

Whom when his Lady saw to him she ran 
With hasty joy to see him made her glad
And sad to view his visage pale and wan
Who earst in flowres of freshest youth was clad
Tho when her well of teares she wasted had
She said Ah dearest Lord what evill starre 
On you hath fround and pourd his influence bad
That of your selfe ye thus berobbed arre

But welcome now my Lord in wele or woe
Whose presence I have lackt too long a day 
And fie on Fortune mine avowed foe
Whose wrathful wreakes them selves doe now alay
And for these wrongs shall treble penaunce pay
Of treble good good growes of evils priefe
The chearelesse man whom sorrow did dismay 
Had no delight to treaten of his griefe

Faire Lady then said that victorious knight
The things that grievous were to do or beare
Them to renew I wote breeds no delight 
Best musicke breeds delight in loathing eare
But th' onely good that growes of passed feare
Is to be wise and ware of like agein
This dayes ensample hath this lesson deare
Deepe written in my heart with yron pen 

Henceforth sir knight take to you wonted strength
And maister these mishaps with patient might
Loe where your foe lyes stretcht in monstrous length
And loe that wicked woman in your sight 
The roote of all your care and wretched plight
Now in your powre to let her live or dye
To do her dye quoth Una were despight
And shame t'avenge so weake an enimy

So as she bad that witch they disaraid
And robd of royall robes and purple pall
And ornaments that richly were displaid
Ne spared they to strip her naked all
Then when they had despoiled her tire and call 
Such as she was their eyes might her behold
That her misshaped parts did them appall
A loathly wrinckled hag ill favoured old
 

Which when the knights beheld amazd they were 
And wondred at so fowle deformed wight
Such then said Una as she seemeth here
Such is the face of falshood such the sight
Of fowle Duessa when her borrowed light
Is laid away and counterfesaunce knowne 
Thus when they had the witch disrobed quight
And all her filthy feature open showne

She flying fast from heavens hated face
And from the world that her discovered wide 
Fled to the wastfull wildernesse apace
From living eyes her open shame to hide
And lurkt in rocks and caves long unespide
But that faire crew of knights and Una faire
Did in that castle afterwards abide 
To rest them selves and weary powres repaire

O goodly golden chaine wherewith yfere
The vertues linked are in lovely wize
And noble mindes of yore allyed were
In brave poursuit of chevalrous emprize
That none did others safety despize 
Nor aid envy to him in need that stands
But friendly each did others prayse devize
How to advaunce with favourable hands

Who when their powres empaird through labour long 
With dew repast they had recured well
And that weake captive wight now wexed strong
Them list no lenger there at leasure dwell
But forward fare as their adventures fell
But ere they parted Una faire besought 
That straunger knight his name and nation tell
Least so great good as he for her had wrought

Faire virgin said the Prince ye me require
A thing without the compas of my wit 
For both the lignage and the certain Sire
From which I sprong from me are hidden yit
For all so soone as life did me admit
Into this world and shewed heavens light
From mothers pap I taken was unfit 
And streight deliver'd to a Faery knight

Unto old Timon he me brought bylive
Old Timon who in youthly yeares hath beene
In warlike feates th'expertest man alive 
And is the wisest now on earth I weene
His dwelling is low in a valley greene
Under the foot of Rauran mossy hore
From whence the river Dee as silver cleene
His tombling billowes roll with gentle rore 

Thither the great magicien Merlin came
As was his use ofttimes to visit me
For he had charge my discipline to frame
And Tutours nouriture to oversee 
Him oft and oft I askt in privitie
Of what loines and what lignage I did spring
Whose aunswere bad me still assured bee
That I was sonne and heire unto a king

Well worthy impe said then the Lady gent
And pupill fit for such a Tutours hand
But what adventure or what high intent
Hath brought you hither into Faery land
Aread Prince Arthur crowne of Martiall band 
Full hard it is quoth he to read aright
The course of heavenly cause or understand
The secret meaning of th' eternall might

For whether he through fatall deepe foresight 
Me hither sent for cause to me unghest
Or that fresh bleeding wound which day and night
Whilome doth rancle in my riven brest
With forced fury following his behest
Me hither brought by wayes yet never found 
You to have helpt I hold myself yet blest
Ah curteous knight quoth she what secret wound

Deare dame quoth he you sleeping sparkes awake
Which troubled once into huge flames will grow 
Ne ever will their fervent fury slake
Till living moysture into smoke do flow
And wasted life do lye in ashes low
Yet sithens silence lesseneth not my fire
But told it flames and hidden it does glow 
I will revele what ye so much desire

It was in freshest flowre of youthly yeares
When courage first does creepe in manly chest
Then first the coale of kindly heat appeares 
To kindle love in every living brest
But me had warnd old Timons wise behest
Those creeping flames by reason to subdew
Before their rage grew to so great unrest
As miserable lovers use to rew 

That idle name of love and lovers life
As losse of time and vertues enimy
I ever scornd and joyd to stirre up strife
In middest of their mournfull Tragedy 
Ay wont to laugh when them I heard to cry
And blow the fire which them to ashes brent
Their God himselfe griev'd at my libertie
Shot many a dart at me with fiers intent

But all in vaine no fort can be so strong
Ne fleshly brest can armed be so sound
But will at last be wonne with battrie long
Or unawares at disadvantage found
Nothing is sure that growes on earthly ground 
And who most trustes in arme of fleshly might
And boasts in beauties chaine not to be bound
Doth soonest fall in disaventrous fight

Ensample make of him your haplesse joy 
And of my selfe now mated as ye see
Whose prouder vaunt that proud avenging boy
Did soone pluck downe and curbd my libertie
For on a day prickt forth with jollitie
Of looser life and heat of hardiment 
Raunging the forest wide on courser free
The fields the floods the heavens with one consent

For-wearied with my sports I did alight
From loftie steed and downe to sleepe me layd 
The verdant gras my couch did goodly dight
And pillow was my helmet faire displayd
Whiles every sence the humour sweet embayd
And slombring soft my hart did steale away
Me seemed by my side a royall Mayd 
Her daintie limbes full softly down did lay

Most goodly glee and lovely blandishment
She to me made and bad me love her deare
For dearely sure her love was to me bent 
As when just time expired should appeare
But whether dreames delude or true it were
Was never hart so ravisht with delight
Ne living man like words did ever heare
As she to me delivered all that night 

When I awoke and found her place devoyd
And nought but pressed gras where she had lyen
I sorrowed all so much as earst I joyd
And washed all her place with watry eyen 
From that day forth I lov'd that face divine
From that day forth I cast in carefull mind
To seeke her out with labour and long tyne
And never vowd to rest till her I find

Thus as he spake his visage wexed pale
And chaunge of hew great passion did bewray
Yet still he strove to cloke his inward bale
And hide the smoke that did his fire display
Till gentle Una thus to him gan say 
O happy Queene of Faeries that has found
Mongst many one that with his prowesse may
Defend thine honour and thy foes confound

Thine O then said the gentle Recrosse knight 
Next to that Ladies love shal be the place
O fairest virgin full of heavenly light
Whose wondrous faith exceeding earthly race
Was firmest fixt in mine extremest case
And you my Lord the Patrone of my life 
Of that great Queene may well gaine worthy grace
For onely worthy you through prowes priefe

So diversly discoursing of their loves
The golden Sunne his glistring head gan shew 
And sad remembraunce now the Prince amoves
With fresh desire his voyage to pursew
Als Una earnd her traveill to renew
Then those two knights fast friendship for to bynd
And love establish each to other trew 
Gave goodly gifts the signes of gratefull mynd

Prince Arthur gave a boxe of Diamond sure
Embowd with gold and gorgeous ornament
Wherein were closd few drops of liquor pure 
Of wondrous worth and vertue excellent
That any wound could heale incontinent
Which to requite the Redcrosse knight him gave
A booke wherein his Saveours testament
Was writ with golden letters rich and brave 

Thus beene they parted Arthur on his way
To seeke his love and th' other for to fight
With Unaes foe that all her realme did pray
But she now weighing the decayed plight 
And shrunken synewes of her chosen knight
Would not a while her forward course pursew
Ne bring him forth in face of dreadfull fight
Till he recovered had his former hew

So as they traveild lo they gan espy
An armed knight towards them gallop fast
That seemed from some feared foe to fly
Or other griesly thing that him aghast
Still as he fled his eye was backward cast 
As if his feare still followed him behind
Als flew his steed as he his bands had brast
And with his winged heeles did tread the wind

Nigh as he drew they might perceive his head 
To be unarmd and curld uncombed heares
Upstaring stiffe dismayd with uncouth dread
Nor drop of bloud in all his face appeares
Nor life in limbe and to increase his feares
In fowle reproch of knighthoods faire degree 
About his neck an hempen rope he weares
That with his glistring armes does ill agree

The Redcrosse knight toward him crossed fast
To weet what mister wight was so dismayd 
There him he finds all sencelesse and aghast
That of him selfe he seemd to be afrayd
Whom hardly he from flying forward stayd
Till he these wordes to him deliver might
Sir knight aread who hath ye thus arayd 
And eke from whom make ye this hasty flight

He answerd nought at all but adding new
Feare to his first amazment staring wide
With stony eyes and hartlesse hollow hew 
Astonisht stood as one that had aspide
Infernall furies with their chaines untide
Him yet againe and yet againe bespake
The gentle knight who nought to him replide
But trembling every joint did inly quake 

For Gods deare love Sir knight do me not stay
For loe he comes he comes fast after mee
Eft looking back would faine have runne away
But he him forst to stay and tellen free 
The secret cause of his perplexitie
Yet nathemore by his bold hartie speach
Could his bloud-frosen hart emboldned bee
But through his boldnesse rather feare did reach

And am I now in safetie sure quoth he
From him that would have forced me to dye
And is the point of death now turnd fro mee
That I may tell this haplesse history
Feare nought quoth he no daunger now is nye 
Then shall I you recount a ruefull cace
Said he the which with this unlucky eye
I late beheld and had not greater grace

I lately chaunst would I had never chaunst 
With a faire knight to keepen companee
Sir Terwin hight that well himselfe advaunst
In all affaires and was both bold and free
But not so happy as mote happy bee
He lov'd as was his lot a Ladie gent 
That him againe lov'd in the least degree
For she was proud and of too high intent

From whom returning sad and comfortlesse
As on the way together we did fare 
We met that villen God from him me blesse
That cursed wight from whom I scapt whyleare
A man of hell that cals himselfe Despaire
Who first us greets and after faire areedes
Of tydings strange and of adventures rare 
So creeping close as Snake in hidden weedes

Which when he knew and felt our feeble harts
Embost with bale and bitter byting griefe
Which love had launched with his deadly darts 
With wounding words and termes of foule repriefe
He pluckt from us all hope of due reliefe
That earst us held in love of lingring life
Then hopelesse hartlesse gan the cunning thiefe
Perswade us die to stint all further strife 

With which sad instrument of hasty death
That wofull lover loathing lenger light
A wide way made to let forth living breath
But I more fearfull or more luckie wight 
Dismayd with that deformed dismall sight
Fled fast away halfe dead with dying feare
Ne yet assur'd of life by you Sir knight
Whose like infirmitie like chaunce may beare

How may a man said he with idle speach
Be wonne to spoyle the Castle of his health
I wote quoth he whom triall late did teach
That like would not for all this worldes wealth
His subtill tongue like dropping honny mealt'h 
Into the hart and searcheth every vaine
That ere one be aware by secret stealth
His powre is reft and weaknesse doth remaine

Certes said he hence shall I never rest 
Till I that treacherours art have heard and tride
And you Sir knight whose name mote I request
Of grace do me unto his cabin guide
I that hight Trevisan quoth he will ride
Against my liking backe to do you grace 
But not for gold nor glee will I abide
By you when ye arrive in that same place

Ere long they come where that same wicked wight
His dwelling has low in an hollow cave 
Farre underneath a craggie clift ypight
Darke dolefull drearie like a greedy grave
That still for carrion carcases doth crave
On top whereof aye dwelt the ghastly Owle
Shrieking his balefull note which ever drave 
Far from that haunt all other chearefull fowle

And all about old stockes and stubs of trees
Whereon nor fruit nor leafe was ever seene
Did hang upon the ragged rocky knees 
On which had many wretches hanged beene
Whose carcases were scattered on the greene
And throwne about the clifts Arrived there
That bare-head knight for dread and dolefull teene
Would faine have fled ne durst approchen neare 

That darkesome cave they enter where they find
That cursed man low sitting on the ground
Musing full sadly in his sullein mind
His griesie lockes long growen and unbound 
Disordred hong about his shoulders round
And hid his face through which his hollow eyne
Lookt deadly dull and stared as astound
His raw-bone cheekes through penurie and pine

His garment nought but many ragged clouts
With thornes together pind and patched was
The which his naked sides he wrapt abouts
And him beside there lay upon the gras
A drearie corse whose life away did pas 
All wallowed in his owne yet luke-warme blood
That from his wound yet welled fresh alas
In which a rustie knife fast fixed stood

Which piteous spectacle approving trew 
The wofull tale that Trevisan had told
When as the gentle Redcrosse knight did vew
With firie zeale he burnt in courage bold
Him to avenge before his bloud were cold
And to the villein said Thou damned wight 
The author of this fact we here behold
What justice can but judge against thee right

What franticke fit quoth he hath thus distraught
Thee foolish man so rash a doome to give 
What justice ever other judgement taught
But he should die who merites not to live
None else to death this man despayring drive
But his owne guiltie mind deserving death
Is then unjust to each his due to give 
Or let him die that loatheth living breath

Who travels by the wearie wandring way
To come unto his wished home in haste
And meetes a flood that doth his passage stay 
Is not great grace to helpe him over past
Or free his feet that in the myre sticke fast
Most envious man that grieves at neighbours good
And fond that joyest in the woe thou hast
Why wilt not let him passe that long hath stood 

He there does now enjoy eternall rest
And happy ease which thou dost want and crave
And further from it daily wanderest
What if some little paine the passage have 
That makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter wave
Is not short paine well borne that brings long ease
And layes the soule to sleepe in quiet grave
Sleepe after toyle port after stormie seas

The knight much wondred at his suddeine wit
And said The terme of life is limited
Ne may a man prolong nor shorten it
The souldier may not move from watchfull sted
Nor leave his stand untill his Captaine bed 
Who life did limit by almightie doome
Quoth he knowes best the termes established
And he that points the Centonell his roome

Is not his deed what ever thing is donne 
In heaven and earth did not he all create
To die againe all ends that was begonne
Their times in his eternall booke of fate
Are written sure and have their certaine date
Who then can strive with strong necessitie 
That holds the world in his still chaunging state
Or shunne the death ordaynd by destinie

The lenger life I wote the greater sin
The greater sin the greater punishment 
All those great battels which thou boasts to win
Through strife and blood-shed and avengement
Now praysd hereafter deare thou shalt repent
For life must life and blood must blood repay
Is not enough thy evill life forespent 
For he that once hath missed the right way

Then do no further goe no further stray
But here lie downe and to thy rest betake
Th' ill to prevent that life ensewen may 
For what hath life that may it loved make
And gives not rather cause it to forsake
Feare sicknesse age losse labour sorrow strife
Paine hunger cold that makes the hart to quake
And ever fickle fortune rageth rife 

Thou wretched man of death hast greatest need
If in true ballance thou wilt weigh thy state
For never knight that dared warlike deede
More lucklesse disaventures did amate 
Witnesse the dungeon deepe wherein of late
Thy life shut up for death so oft did call
And though good lucke prolonged hath thy date
Yet death then would the like mishaps forestall

Why then doest thou O man of sin desire
To draw thy dayes forth to their last degree
Is not the measure of thy sinfull hire
High heaped up with huge iniquitie
Against the day of wrath to burden thee 
Is not enough that to this Ladie milde
Thou falsed hast thy faith with perjurie
And sold thy selfe to serve Duessa vilde

Is not he just that all this doth behold 
From highest heaven and beares an equall eye
Shall he thy sins up in his knowledge fold
And guilty be of thine impietie
Is not his law Let every sinner die
Die shall all flesh what then must needs be donne 
Is it not better to doe willinglie
Then linger till the glasse be all out ronne

The knight was much enmoved with his speach
That as a swords point through his hart did perse 
And in his conscience made a secret breach
Well knowing true all that he did reherse
And to his fresh remembraunce did reverse
The ugly vew of his deformed crimes
That all his manly powres it did disperse 
As he were charmed with inchaunted rimes

In which amazement when the Miscreant
Perceived him to waver weake and fraile
Whiles trembling horror did his conscience dant 
And hellish anguish did his soule assaile
To drive him to despaire and quite to quaile
He shew'd him painted in a table plaine
The damned ghosts that doe in torments waile
And thousand feends that doe them endlesse paine 

The sight whereof so throughly him dismaid
That nought but death before his eyes he saw
And ever burning wrath before him laid
By righteous sentence of th' Almighties law 
Then gan the villein him to overcraw
And brought unto him swords ropes poison fire
And all that might him to perdition draw
And bad him choose what death he would desire

But when as none of them he saw him take
He to him raught a dagger sharpe and keene
And gave it him in hand his hand did quake
And tremble like a leafe of Aspin greene
And troubled bloud through his pale face was seene 
To come and goe with tidings from the heart
As it a running messenger had beene
At last resolv'd to worke his finall smart

Which whenas Una saw through every vaine 
The crudled cold ran to her well of life
As in a swowne but soone reliv'd againe
Out of his hand she snatcht the cursed knife
And threw it to the ground enraged rife
And to him said Fie fie faint harted knight 
What meanest thou by this reprochfull strife
Is this the battell which thou vauntst to fight

Come come away fraile seely fleshly wight
Ne let vaine words bewitch thy manly hart 
Ne divelish thoughts dismay thy constant spright
In heavenly mercies hast thou not a part
Why shouldst thou then despeire that chosen art
Where justice growes there grows eke greater grace
The which doth quench the brond of hellish smart 
And that accurst hand-writing doth deface

So up he rose and thence amounted streight
Which when the carle beheld and saw his guest
Would safe depart for all his subtill sleight 
He chose an halter from among the rest
And with it hung himselfe unbid unblest
But death he could not worke himselfe thereby
For thousand times he so himselfe had drest
Yet nathelesse it could not doe him die 

What man is he that boasts of fleshly might
And vaine assurance of mortality
Which all so soone as it doth come to fight
Against spirituall foes yeelds by and by
Or from the field most cowardly doth fly 
Ne let the man ascribe it to his skill
That thorough grace hath gained victory
If any strength we have it is to ill

But that which lately hapned Una saw 
That this her knight was feeble and too faint
And all his sinews woxen weake and raw
Through long enprisonment and hard constraint
Which he endured in his late restraint
That yet he was unfit for bloudy fight 
Therefore to cherish him with diets daint
She cast to bring him where he chearen might

There was an auntient house not farre away
Renowmd throughout the world for sacred lore 
And pure unspotted life so well they say
It governd was and guided evermore
Through wisedome of a matrone grave and hore
Whose onely joy was to relieve the needes
Of wretched soules and helpe the helpelesse pore 
All night she spent in bidding of her bedes

Dame Coelia men did her call as thought
From heaven to come or thither to arise
The mother of three daughters well upbrought 
In goodly thewes and godly exercise
The eldest two most sober chast and wise
Fidelia and Speranza virgins were
Though spousd yet wanting wedlocks solemnize
But faire Charissa to a lovely fere 

Arrived there the dore they find fast lockt
For it was warely watched night and day
For feare of many foes but when they knockt
The Porter opened unto them streight way 
He was an aged syre all hory gray
With lookes full lowly cast and gate full slow
Wont on a staffe his feeble steps to stay
Hight Humilta They passe in stouping low

Each goodly thing is hardest to begin
But entred in a spacious court they see
Both plaine and pleasant to be walked in
Where them does meete a francklin faire and free
And entertaines with comely courteous glee 
His name was Zele that him right well became
For in his speeches and behaviour hee
Did labour lively to expresse the same

There fairely them receives a gentle Squire 
Of milde demeanure and rare courtesie
Right cleanly clad in comely sad attire
In word and deede that shew'd great modestie
And knew his good to all of each degree
Hight Reverence He them with speeches meet 
Does faire entreat no courting nicetie
But simple true and eke unfained sweet

And afterwards them to his Dame he leades
That aged Dame the Ladie of the place 
Who all this while was busy at her beades
Which doen she up arose with seemely grace
And toward them full matronely did pace
Where when that fairest Una she beheld
Whom well she knew to spring from heavenly race 
Her hart with joy unwonted inly sweld

And her embracing said O happie earth
Whereon thy innocent feet doe ever tread
Most vertuous virgin borne of heavenly berth 
That to redeeme thy woefull parents head
From tyrans rage and ever dying dread
Hast wandred through the world now long a day
Yet ceasest not thy weary soles to lead
What grace hath thee now hither brought this way 

Strange thing it is an errant knight to see
Here in this place or any other wight
That hither turnes his steps So few there bee
That chose the narrow path or seeke the right 
All keepe the broad high way and take delight
With many rather for to go astray
And be partakers of their evill plight
Then with a few to walke the rightest way

Thy selfe to see and tyred limbes to rest
O matrone sage quoth she I hither came
And this good knight his way with me addrest
Led with thy prayses and broad-blazed fame
That up to heaven is blowne The auncient Dame 
Him goodly greeted in her modest guise
And entertaynd them both as best became
With all the court'sies that she could devise

Thus as they gan of sundry things devise 
Loe two most goodly virgins came in place
Ylinked arme in arme in lovely wise
With countenance demure and modest grace
They numbred even steps and equall pace
Of which the eldest that Fidelia hight 
Like sunny beames threw from her christall face
That could have dazd the rash beholders sight

She was araied all in lilly white
And in her right hand bore a cup of gold 
With wine and water fild up to the hight
In which a Serpent did himselfe enfold
That horrour made to all that did behold
But she no whit did chaunge her constant mood
And in her other hand she fast did hold 
A booke that was both signd and seald with blood

Her younger sister that Speranza hight
Was clad in blew that her beseemed well
Not all so chearefull seemed she of sight 
As was her sister whether dread did dwell
Or anguish in her hart is hard to tell
Upon her arme a silver anchor lay
Whereon she leaned ever as befell
And ever up to heaven as she did pray 

They seeing Una towards her gan wend
Who them encounters with like courtesie
Many kind speeches they betwene them spend
And greatly joy each other well to see 
Then to the knight with shamefast modestie
They turne themselves at Unaes meeke request
And him salute with well beseeming glee
Who faire them quites as him beseemed best

Then Una thus But she your sister deare
The deare Charissa where is she become
Or wants she health or busie is elsewhere
Ah no said they but forth she may not come
For she of late is lightned of her wombe 
And hath encreast the world with one sonne more
That her to see should be but troublesome
Indeed quoth she that should be trouble sore

Then said the aged Coelia Deare dame 
And you good Sir I wote that of youre toyle
And labours long through which ye hither came
Ye both forwearied be therefore a whyle
I read you rest and to your bowres recoyle
Then called she a Groome that forth him led 
Into a goodly lodge and gan despoile
Of puissant armes and laid in easie bed

Now when their wearie limbes with kindly rest
And bodies were refresht with due repast 
Faire Una gan Fidelia faire request
To have her knight into her schoolehouse plaste
That of her heavenly learning he might taste
And heare the wisedom of her words divine
She graunted and that knight so much agraste 
That she him taught celestiall discipline

And that her sacred Booke with blood ywrit
That none could read except she did them teach
She unto him disclosed every whit 
And heavenly documents thereout did preach
That weaker wit of man could never reach
Of God of grace of justice of free will
That wonder was to heare her goodly speach
For she was able with her words to kill 

And when she list poure out her larger spright
She would commaund the hastie Sunne to stay
Or backward turne his course from heavens hight
Sometimes great hostes of men she could dismay 
Dry-shod to passe she parts the flouds in tway
And eke huge mountaines from their native seat
She would commaund themselves to beare away
And throw in raging sea with roaring threat

The faithfull knight now grew in litle space
By hearing her and by her sisters lore
To such perfection of all heavenly grace
That wretched world he gan for to abhore
And mortall life gan loath as thing forlore 
Greevd with remembrance of his wicked wayes
And prickt with anguish of his sinnes so sore
That he desirde to end his wretched dayes

But wise Speranza gave him comfort sweet 
And taught him how to take assured hold
Upon her silver anchor as was meet
Else had his sinnes so great and manifold
Made him forget all that Fidelia told
In this distressed doubtfull agonie 
When him his dearest Una did behold
Disdeining life desiring leave to die

And came to Coelia to declare her smart
Who well acquainted with that commune plight 
Which sinfull horror workes in wounded hart
Her wisely comforted all that she might
With goodly counsell and advisement right
And streightway sent with carefull diligence
To fetch a Leach the which had great insight 
In that disease of grieved conscience

Who comming to that soule-diseased knight
Could hardly him intreat to tell his griefe
Which knowne and all that noyd his heavie spright 
Well searcht eftsoones he gan apply relief
Of salves and med'cines which had passing priefe
And thereto added words of wondrous might
By which to ease he him recured briefe
And much aswag'd the passion of his plight 

But yet the cause and root of all his ill
Inward corruption and infected sin
Not purg'd nor heald behind remained still
And festring sore did rankle yet within 
Close creeping 'twixt the marrow and the skin
Which to extirpe he laid him privily
Downe in a darkesome lowly place farre in
Whereas he meant his corrosives to apply

In ashes and sackcloth he did array
His daintie corse proud humors to abate
And dieted with fasting every day
The swelling of his wounds to mitigate
And made him pray both earely and eke late 
And ever as superfluous flesh did rot
Amendment readie still at hand did wayt
To pluck it out with pincers firie whot

And bitter Penance with an yron whip 
Was wont him once to disple every day
And sharpe Remorse his hart did pricke and nip
That drops of blood thence like a well did play
And sad Repentance used to embay
His bodie in salt water smarting sore 
The filthy blots of sinne to wash away
So in short space they did to health restore

In which his torment often was so great
That like a Lyon he would cry and rore 
And rend his flesh and his owne synewes eat
His owne deare Una hearing evermore
His ruefull shriekes and gronings often tore
Her guiltlesse garments and her golden heare
For pitty of his paine and anguish sore 
Yet all with patience wisely she did beare

Whom thus recover'd by wise Patience
And trew Repentaunce they to Una brought
Who joyous of his cured conscience 
Him dearely kist and fairely eke besought
Himselfe to chearish and consuming thought
To put away out of his carefull brest
By this Charissa late in child-bed brought
Was woxen strong and left her fruitfull nest 

She was a woman in her freshest age
Of wondrous beauty and of bountie rare
With goodly grace and comely personage
That was on earth not easie to compare 
Full of great love but Cupid wanton snare
As hell she hated chast in worke and will
Her necke and breasts were ever open bare
That ay thereof her babes might sucke their fill

A multitude of babes about her hong
Playing their sports that joyd her to behold
Whom still she fed whiles they were weake and young
But thrust them forth still as they wexed old
And on her head she wore a tyre of gold 
Adornd with gemmes and owches wondrous faire
Whose passing price uneath was to be told
And by her side there sate a gentle paire

The knight and Una entring faire her greet 
And bid her joy of that her happie brood
Who them requites with court'sies seeming meet
And entertaines with friendly chearefull mood
Then Una her besought to be so good
As in her vertuous rules to schoole her knight 
Now after all his torment well withstood
In that sad house of Penaunce where his spright

She was right joyous of her just request
And taking by the hand that Faeries sonne 
Gan him instruct in every good behest
Of love and righteousnesse and well to donne
And wrath and hatred warely to shonne
That drew on men Gods hatred and his wrath
And many soules in dolours had fordonne 
In which when him she well instructed hath

Wherein his weaker wandring steps to guide
An auncient matrone she to her does call
Whose sober lookes her wisedome well descride 
Her name was Mercie well knowne over all
To be both gratious and eke liberall
To whom the carefull charge of him she gave
To lead aright that he should never fall
In all his wayes through this wide worldes wave 

The godly Matrone by the hand him beares
Forth from her presence by a narrow way
Scattred with bushy thornes and ragged breares
Which still before him she remov'd away 
That nothing might his ready passage stay
And ever when his feet encombred were
Or gan to shrinke or from the right to stray
She held him fast and firmely did upbeare

Eftsoones unto an holy Hospitall
That was fore by the way she did him bring
In which seven Bead-men that had vowed all
Their life to service of high heavens king
Did spend their dayes in doing godly thing 
Their gates to all were open evermore
That by the wearie way were traveiling
And one sate wayting ever them before

The first of them that eldest was and best 
Of all the house had charge and governement
As Guardian and Steward of the rest
His office was to give entertainement
And lodging unto all that came and went
Not unto such as could him feast againe 
And double quite for that he on them spent
But such as want of harbour did constraine

The second was as Almner of the place
His office was the hungry for to feed 
And thristy give to drinke a worke of grace
He feard not once him selfe to be in need
Ne car'd to hoord for those whom he did breede
The grace of God he layd up still in store
Which as a stocke he left unto his seede 
He had enough what need him care for more

The third had of their wardrobe custodie
In which were not rich tyres nor garments gay
The plumes of pride and wings of vanitie 
But clothes meet to keepe keene could away
And naked nature seemely to aray
With which bare wretched wights he dayly clad
The images of God in earthly clay
And if that no spare cloths to give he had 

The fourth appointed by his office was
Poore prisoners to relieve with gratious ayd
And captives to redeeme with price of bras
From Turkes and Sarazins which them had stayd 
And though they faultie were yet well he wayd
That God to us forgiveth every howre
Much more then that why they in bands were layd
And he that harrowd hell with heavie stowre

The fift had charge sicke persons to attend
And comfort those in point of death which lay
For them most needeth comfort in the end
When sin and hell and death do most dismay
The feeble soule departing hence away 
All is but lost that living we bestow
If not well ended at our dying day
O man have mind of that last bitter throw

The sixt had charge of them now being dead 
In seemely sort their corses to engrave
And deck with dainty flowres their bridall bed
That to their heavenly spouse both sweet and brave
They might appeare when he their soules shall save
The wondrous workmanship of Gods owne mould 
Whose face he made all beasts to feare and gave
All in his hand even dead we honour should

The seventh now after death and buriall done
Had charge the tender orphans of the dead 
And widowes ayd least they should be undone
In face of judgement he their right would plead
Ne ought the powre of mighty men did dread
In their defence nor would for gold or fee
Be wonne their rightfull causes downe to tread 
And when they stood in most necessitee

There when the Elfin knight arrived was
The first and chiefest of the seven whose care
Was guests to welcome towardes him did pas 
Where seeing Mercie that his steps upbare
And alwayes led to her with reverence rare
He humbly louted in meeke lowlinesse
And seemely welcome for her did prepare
For of their order she was Patronesse 

There she awhile him stayes him selfe to rest
That to the rest more able he might bee
During which time in every good behest
And godly worke of almes and charitee 
She him instructed with great industree
Shortly therein so perfect he became
That from the first unto the last degree
His mortall life he learned had to frame

Thence forward by that painfull way they pas
Forth to an hill that was both steepe and hy
On top whereof a sacred chappell was
And eke a little Hermitage thereby
Wherein an aged holy man did lye 
That day and night said his devotion
Ne other worldly busines did apply
His name was heavenly Contemplation

Great grace that old man to him given had 
For God he often saw from heavens hight
All were his earthly eyen both blunt and bad
And through great age had lost their kindly sight
Yet wondrous quick and persant was his spright
As Eagles eye that can behold the Sunne 
That hill they scale with all their powre and might
That his fraile thighes nigh weary and fordonne

There they do finde that godly aged Sire
With snowy lockes adowne his shoulders shed 
As hoarie frost with spangles doth attire
The mossy braunches of an Oke halfe ded
Each bone might through his body well be red
And every sinew seene through his long fast
For nought he car'd his carcas long unfed 
His mind was full of spirituall repast

Who when these two approaching he aspide
At their first presence grew agrieved sore
That forst him lay his heavenly thoughts aside 
And had he not that Dame respected more
Whom highly he did reverence and adore
He would not once have moved for the knight
They him saluted standing far afore
Who well them greeting humbly did requight 

What end quoth she should cause us take such paine
But that same end which every living wight
Should make his marke high heaven to attaine
Is not from hence the way that leadeth right 
To that most glorious house that glistreth bright
With burning starres and everliving fire
Whereof the keyes are to thy hand behight
By wise Fidelia She doth thee require

Thrise happy man said then the father grave
Whose staggering steps thy steady hand doth lead
And shewes the way his sinfull soule to save
Who better can the way to heaven aread
Then thou thy selfe that was both borne and bred 
In heavenly throne where thousand Angels shine
Thou doest the prayers of the righteous sead
Present before the majestie divine

Yet since thou bidst thy pleasure shal be donne 
Then come thou man of earth and see the way
That never yet was seene of Faeries sonne
That never leads the traveiler astray
But after labors long and sad delay
Brings them to joyous rest and endlesse blis 
But first thou must a season fast and pray
Till from her bands the spright assoiled is

That donne he leads him to the highest Mount
Such one as that same mighty man of God 
That blood-red billowes like a walled front
On either side disparted with his rod
Till that his army dry-foot through them yod
Dwelt forty dayes upon where writ in stone
With bloudy letters by the hand of God 
The bitter doome of death and balefull mone

Or like that sacred hill whose head full hie
Adornd with fruitfull Olives all arownd
Is as it were for endlesse memory 
Of that deare Lord who oft thereon was fownd
For ever with a flowring girlond crownd
Or like that pleasaunt Mount that is for ay
Through famous Poets verse each where renownd
On which the thrise three learned Ladies play 

From thence far off he unto him did shew
A litle path that was both steepe and long
Which to a goodly Citie led his vew
Whose wals and towres were builded high and strong 
Of perle and precious stone that earthly tong
Cannot describe nor wit of man can tell
Too high a ditty for my simple song
The Citie of the great king hight it well

As he thereon stood gazing he might see
The blessed Angels to and fro descend
From highest heaven in gladsome companee
And with great joy into that Citie wend
As commonly as friend does with his frend 
Whereat he wondred much and gan enquere
What stately building durst so high extend
Her loftie towres unto the starry sphere

Faire knight quoth he Hierusalem that is 
The new Hierusalem that God has built
For those to dwell in that are chosen his
His chosen people purg'd from sinfull guilt
With pretious blood which cruelly was spilt
On cursed tree of that unspotted lam 
That for the sinnes of al the world was kilt
Now are they Saints all in that Citie sam

Till now said then the knight I weened well
That great Cleopolis where I have beene 
In which that fairest Faerie Queene doth dwell
The fairest citie was that might be seene
And that bright towre all built of christall cleene
Panthea seemd the brightest thing that was
But now by proofe all otherwise I weene 
For this great Citie that does far surpas

Most trew then said the holy aged man
Yet is Cleopolis for earthly frame
The fairest peece that eye beholden can 
And well beseemes all knights of noble name
That covett in th' immortall booke of fame
To be eternized that same to haunt
And doen their service to that soveraigne dame
That glorie does to them for guerdon graunt 

And thou faire ymp sprong out from English race
How ever now accompted Elfins sonne
Well worthy doest thy service for her grace
To aide a virgin desolate fordonne 
But when thou famous victory hast wonne
And high emongst all knights hast hong thy shield
Thenceforth the suit of earthly conquest shonne
And wash thy hands from guilt of bloudy field

Then seek this path that I to thee presage
Which after all to heaven shall thee send
Then peaceably thy painefull pilgrimage
To yonder same Hierusalem do bend
Where is for thee ordaind a blessed end 
For thou emongst those Saints whom thou doest see
Shall be a Saint and thine owne nations frend
And Patrone thou Saint George shalt called bee

Unworthy wretch quoth he of so great grace 
How dare I thinke such glory to attaine
These that have it attaind were in like cace
Quoth he as wretched and liv'd in like paine
But deeds of armes must I at last be faine
And Ladies love to leave so dearely bought 
What need of armes where peace doth ay remaine
Said he and battailes none are to be fought

O let me not quoth he then turne againe
Backe to the world whose joyes so fruitlesse are 
But let me here for aye in peace remaine
Or streight way on that last long voyage fare
That nothing may my present hope empare
That may not be said he ne maist thou yit
Forgo that royall maides bequeathed care 
Who did her cause into thy hand commit

Then shall I soone quoth he so God me grace
Abet that virgins cause disconsolate
And shortly backe returne unto this place 
To walke this way in Pilgrims poore estate
But now aread old father why of late
Didst thou behight me borne of English blood
Whom all a Faeries sonne doen nominate
That word shall I said he avouchen good 

For well I wote thou springst from ancient race
Of Saxon kings that have with mightie hand
And many bloody battailes fought in place
High reard their royall throne in Britane land 
And vanquisht them unable to withstand
From thence a Faerie thee unweeting reft
There as thou slepst in tender swadling band
And her base Elfin brood there for thee left

Thence she thee brought into this Faerie lond
And in an heaped furrow did thee hyde
Where thee a Ploughman all unweeting fond
As he his toylesome teme that way did guyde
And brought thee up in ploughmans state to byde 
Whereof Georgos he gave thee to name
Till prickt with courage and thy forces pryde
To Faerie court thou cam'st to seeke for fame

O holy Sire quoth he how shall I quight 
The many favours I with thee have found
That hast my name and nation red aright
And taught the way that does to heaven bound
This said adowne he looked to the ground
To have returnd but dazed were his eyne 
Through passing brightnesse which did quite confound
His feeble sence and too exceeding shyne

At last whenas himselfe he gan to find
To Una back he cast him to retire 
Who him awaited still with pensive mind
Great thankes and goodly meed to that good syre
He thence departing gave for his paines hyre
So came to Una who him joyd to see
And after little rest gan him desire 
Of her adventure mindfull for to bee

High time now gan it wex for Una faire
To thinke of those her captive Parents deare
And their forwasted kingdome to repaire
Whereto whenas they now approched neare
With hartie wordes her knight she gan to cheare 
And in her modest manner thus bespake
Deare knight as deare as ever knight was deare
That all these sorrowes suffer for my sake

Now are we come unto my native soyle 
And to the place where all our perils dwell
Here haunts that feend and does his dayly spoyle
Therefore henceforth be at your keeping well
And ever ready for your foeman fell
The sparke of noble courage now awake 
And strive your excellent selfe to excell
That shall ye evermore renowmed make

And pointing forth Lo yonder is said she
The brasen towre in which my parents deare 
For dread of that huge feend emprisond be
Whom I from far see on the walles appeare
Whose sight my feeble soule doth greatly cheare
And on the top of all I do espye
The watchman wayting tydings glad to heare 
That O my parents might I happily

With that they heard a roaring hideous sound
That all the ayre with terrour filled wide
And seemd uneath to shake the stedfast ground 
Eftsoones that dreadful Dragon they espide
Where stretcht he lay upon the sunny side
Of a great hill himselfe like a great hill
But all so soone as he from far descride
Those glistring armes that heaven with light did fill 

Then bad the knight his Lady yede aloofe
And to an hill her selfe withdraw aside
From whence she might behold that battailles proof
And eke be safe from daunger far descryde 
She him obayd and turnd a little wyde
Now O thou sacred muse most learned Dame
Faire ympe of Phoebus and his aged bride
The Nourse of time and everlasting fame

O gently come into my feeble brest
Come gently but not with that mighty rage
Wherewith the martiall troupes thou doest infest
And harts of great Heroes doest enrage
That nought their kindled courage may aswage 
Soone as thy dreadfull trompe begins to sownd
The God of warre with his fiers equipage
Thou doest awake sleepe never he so sownd

Faire Goddesse lay that furious fit aside 
Till I of warres and bloody Mars do sing
And Briton fields with Sarazin bloud bedyde
Twixt that great Faery Queene and Paynim king
That with their horrour heaven and earth did ring
A worke of labour long and endlesse prayse 
But now a while let downe that haughtie string
And to my tunes thy second tenor rayse

By this the dreadfull Beast drew nigh to hand
Halfe flying and halfe footing in his haste 
That with his largenesse measured much land
And made wide shadow under his huge wast
As mountaine doth the valley overcast
Approching nigh he reared high afore
His body monstrous horrible and vaste 
Which to increase his wondrous greatnesse more

And over all with brasen scales was armd
Like plated coate of steele so couched neare
That nought mote perce ne might his corse be harmd 
With dint of sword nor push of pointed speare
Which as an Eagle seeing pray appeare
His aery plumes doth rouze full rudely dight
So shaked he that horrour was to heare
For as the clashing of an Armour bright 

His flaggy wings when forth he did display
Were like two sayles in which the hollow wynd
Is gathered full and worketh speedy way
And eke the pennes that did his pineons bynd 
Were like mayne-yards with flying canvas lynd
With which whenas him list the ayre to beat
And there by force unwonted passage find
The cloudes before him fled for terrour great

His huge long tayle wound up in hundred foldes
Does overspred his long bras-scaly backe
Whose wreathed boughts when ever he unfoldes
And thicke entangled knots adown does slacke
Bespotted as with shields of red and blacke 
It sweepeth all the land behind him farre
And of three furlongs does but litle lacke
And at the point two stings in-fixed arre

But stings and sharpest steele did far exceed 
The sharpnesse of his cruell rending clawes
Dead was it sure as sure as death in deed
What ever thing does touch his ravenous pawes
Or what within his reach he ever drawes
But his most hideous head my toung to tell 
Does tremble for his deepe devouring jawes
Wide gaped like the griesly mouth of hell

And that more wondrous was in either jaw
Three ranckes of yron teeth enraunged were 
In which yet trickling blood and gobbets raw
Of late devoured bodies did appeare
That sight thereof bred cold congealed feare
Which to increase and as atonce to kill
A cloud of smoothering smoke and sulphure seare 
Out of his stinking gorge forth steemed still

His blazing eyes like two bright shining shields
Did burne with wrath and sparkled living fyre
As two broad Beacons set in open fields 
Send forth their flames far off to every shyre
And warning give that enemies conspyre
With fire and sword the region to invade
So flam'd his eyne with rage and rancorous yre
But farre within as in a hollow glade 

So dreadfully he towards him did pas
Forelifting up aloft his speckled brest
And often bounding on the brused gras
As for great joyance of his newcome guest 
Eftsoones he gan advance his haughtie crest
As chauffed Bore his bristles doth upreare
And shoke his scales to battell ready drest
That made the Redcrosse knight nigh quake for feare

The knight gan fairely couch his steadie speare
And fiercely ran at him with rigorous might
The pointed steele arriving rudely theare
His harder hide would neither perce nor bight
But glauncing by forth passed forward right 
Yet sore amoved with so puissaunt push
The wrathfull beast about him turned light
And him so rudely passing by did brush

Both horse and man up lightly rose againe 
And fresh encounter towards him addrest
But th'idle stroke yet backe recoyld in vaine
And found no place his deadly point to rest
Exceeding rage enflam'd the furious beast
To be avenged of so great despight 
For never felt his imperceable brest
So wondrous force from hand of living wight

Then with his waving wings displayed wyde
Himselfe up high he lifted from the ground 
And with strong flight did forcibly divide
The yielding aire which nigh too feeble found
Her flitting parts and element unsound
To beare so great a weight he cutting way
With his broad sayles about him soared round 
At last low stouping with unweldie sway

Long he them bore above the subject plaine
So far as Ewghen bow a shaft may send
Till struggling strong did him at last constraine 
To let them downe before his flightes end
As hagard hauke presuming to contend
With hardie fowle above his hable might
His wearie pounces all in vaine doth spend
To trusse the pray too heavy for his flight 

He so disseized of his gryping grosse
The knight his thrillant speare again assayd
In his bras-plated body to embosse
And three mens strength unto the stroke he layd 
Wherewith the stiffe beame quaked as affrayd
And glauncing from his scaly necke did glyde
Close under his left wing then broad displayd
The percing steele there wrought a wound full wyde

He cryde as raging seas are wont to rore
When wintry storme his wrathfull wreck does threat
The roaring billowes beat the ragged shore
As they the earth would shoulder from her seat
And greedy gulfe does gape as he would eat 
His neighbour element in his revenge
Then gin the blustring brethren boldly threat
To move the world from off his steadfast henge

The steely head stucke fast still in his flesh 
Till with his cruell clawes he snatcht the wood
And quite a sunder broke Forth flowed fresh
A gushing river of blacke goarie blood
That drowned all the land whereon he stood
The streame thereof would drive a water-mill 
Trebly augmented was his furious mood
With bitter sence of his deepe rooted ill

His hideous tayle then hurled he about
And therewith all enwrapt the nimble thyes 
Of his froth-fomy steed whose courage stout
Striving to loose the knot that fast him tyes
Himselfe in streighter bandes too rash implyes
That to the ground he is perforce constraynd
To throw his rider who can quickly ryse 
From off the earth with durty blood distaynd

And fiercely tooke his trenchand blade in hand
With which he stroke so furious and so fell
That nothing seemd the puissaunce could withstand 
Upon his crest the hardned yron fell
But his more hardned crest was armd so well
That deeper dint therein it would not make
Yet so extremely did the buffe him quell
That from thenceforth he shund the like to take 

The knight was wroth to see his stroke beguyld
And smote againe with more outrageous might
But backe againe the sparckling steele recoyld
And left not any marke where it did light 
As if in Adamant rocke it had bene pight
The beast impatient of his smarting wound
And of so fierce and forcible despight
Thought with his wings to stye above the ground

Then full of griefe and anguish vehement
He lowdly brayd that like was never heard
And from his wide devouring oven sent
A flake of fire that flashing in his beard
Him all amazd and almost made affeard 
The scorching flame sore swinged all his face
And through his armour all his body seard
That he could not endure so cruell cace

Not that great Champion of the antique world 
Whom famous Poetes verse so much doth vaunt
And hath for twelve huge labours high extold
So many furies and sharpe fits did haunt
When him the poysond garment did enchaunt
With Centaures bloud and bloudie verses charm'd 
As did this knight twelve thousand dolours daunt
Whom fyrie steele now burnt that earst him arm'd

Faint wearie sore emboyled grieved brent
With heat toyle wounds armes smart and inward fire 
That never man such mischiefes did torment
Death better were death did he oft desire
But death will never come when needes require
Whom so dismayd when that his foe beheld
He cast to suffer him no more respire 
But gan his sturdy sterne about to weld

It fortuned as faire it then befell
Behind his backe unweeting where he stood
Of auncient time there was a springing well 
From which fast trickled forth a silver flood
Full of great vertues and for med'cine good
Whylome before that cursed Dragon got
That happy land and all with innocent blood
Defyld those sacred waves it rightly hot 

For unto life the dead it could restore
And guilt of sinfull crimes cleane wash away
Those that with sicknesse were infected sore
It could recure and aged long decay 
Renew as one were borne that very day
Both Silo this and Jordan did excell
And th' English Bath and eke the German Spau
Ne can Cephise nor Hebrus match this well

Now gan the golden Phoebus for to steepe
His fierie face in billowes of the west
And his faint steedes watred in Ocean deepe
Whiles from their journall labours they did rest
When that infernall Monster having kest 
His wearie foe into that living well
Can high advance his broad discoloured brest
Above his wonted pitch with countenance fell

Which when his pensive Ladie saw from farre 
Great woe and sorrow did her soule assay
As weening that the sad end of the warre
And gan to highest God entirely pray
That feared chance from her to turne away
With folded hands and knees full lowly bent 
All night she watcht ne once adowne would lay
Her daintie limbs in her sad dreriment

The morrow next gan early to appeare
That Titan rose to runne his daily race 
But early ere the morrow next gan reare
Out of the sea faire Titans deawy face
Up rose the gentle virgin from her place
And looked all about if she might spy
Her loved knight to move his manly pace 
For she had great doubt of his safety

At last she saw where he upstarted brave
Out of the well wherein he drenched lay
As Eagle fresh out of the Ocean wave 
Where he hath left his plumes all hoary gray
And deckt himselfe with feathers youthly gay
Like Eyas hauke up mounts unto the skies
His newly budded pineons to assay
And marveiles at himselfe still as he flies 

Whom when the damned feend so fresh did spy
No wonder if he wondred at the sight
And doubted whether his late enemy
It were or other new supplied knight 
He now to prove his late renewed might
High brandishing his bright deaw-burning blade
Upon his crested scalpe so sore did smite
That to the scull a yawning wound it made

I wote not whether the revenging steele
Were hardned with that holy water dew
Wherein he fell or sharper edge did feele
Or his baptized hands now greater grew
Or other secret vertue did ensew 
Else never could the force of fleshly arme
Ne molten mettall in his blood embrew
For till that stownd could never wight him harme

The cruell wound enraged him so sore 
That loud he yelded for exceeding paine
As hundred ramping Lyons seem'd to rore
Whom ravenous hunger did thereto constraine
Then gan he tosse aloft his stretched traine
And therewith scourge the buxome aire so sore 
That to his force to yeelden it was faine
Ne ought his sturdy strokes might stand afore

The same advauncing high above his head
With sharpe intended sting so rude him smot 
That to the earth him drove as stricken dead
Ne living wight would have him life behot
The mortall sting his angry needle shot
Quite through his shield and in his shoulder seasd
Where fast it stucke ne would there out be got 
The griefe thereof him wondrous sore diseasd

But yet more mindfull of his honour deare
Then of the grievous smart which him did wring
From loathed soile he can him lightly reare 
And strove to loose the far infixed sting
Which when in vaine he tryde with struggeling
Inflam'd with wrath his raging blade he heft
And strooke so strongly that the knotty string
Of his huge taile he quite a sunder cleft 

Hart cannot thinke what outrage and what cryes
With foule enfouldred smoake and flashing fire
The hell-bred beast threw forth unto the skyes
That all was covered with darkenesse dire 
Then fraught with rancour and engorged ire
He cast at once him to avenge for all
And gathering up himselfe out of the mire
With his uneven wings did fiercely fall

Much was the man encombred with his hold
In feare to lose his weapon in his paw
Ne wist yet how his talaunts to unfold
For harder was from Cerberus greedy jaw
To plucke a bone then from his cruell claw 
To reave by strength the griped gage away
Thrise he assayd it from his foot to draw
And thrise in vaine to draw it did assay

Tho when he saw no power might prevaile 
His trustie sword he cald to his last aid
Wherewith he fiercely did his foe assaile
And double blowes about him stoutly laid
That glauncing fire out of the yron plaid
As sparckles from the Andvile use to fly 
When heavy hammers on the wedge are swaid
Therewith at last he forst him to unty

The other foot fast fixed on his shield
Whenas no strength nor stroks mote him constraine 
To loose ne yet the warlike pledge to yield
He smot thereat with all his might and maine
That nought so wondrous puissaunce might sustaine
Upon the joint the lucky steele did light
And made such way that hewd it quite in twaine 
The paw yett missed not his minisht might

For griefe thereof and divelish despight
From his infernall fournace forth he threw
Huge flames that dimmed all the heavens light 
Enrold in duskish smoke and brimstone blew
As burning Aetna from his boyling stew
Doth belch out flames and rockes in peeces broke
And ragged ribs of mountains molten new
Enwrapt in coleblacke clouds and filthy smoke 

The heate whereof and harmefull pestilence
So sore him noyd that forst him to retire
A little backward for his best defence
To save his body from the scorching fire 
Which he from hellish entrailes did expire
It chaunst eternall God that chaunce did guide
As he recoiled backward in the mire
His nigh forwearied feeble feet did slide

There grew a goodly tree him faire beside
Loaden with fruit and apples rosie red
As they in pure vermilion had beene dide
Whereof great vertues over all were red
For happy life to all which thereon fed 
And life eke everlasting did befall
Great God it planted in that blessed sted
With his Almighty hand and did it call

In all the world like was not to be found 
Save in that soile where all good things did grow
And freely sprong out of the fruitfull ground
As incorrupted Nature did them sow
Till that dread Dragon all did overthrow
Another like faire tree eke grew thereby 
Whereof whoso did eat eftsoones did know
Both good and ill O mornefull memory

From that first tree forth flowd as from a well
A trickling streame of Balme most soveraine 
And dainty deare which on the ground still fell
And overflowed all the fertile plaine
As it had deawed bene with timely raine
Life and long health that gratious ointment gave
And deadly wounds could heale and reare againe 
The senselesse corse appointed for the grave

For nigh thereto the ever damned beast
Durst not approch for he was deadly made
And all that life preserved did detest 
Yet he is oft adventur'd to invade
By this the drouping day-light gan to fade
And yield his roome to sad succeeding night
Who with her sable mantle gan to shade
The face of earth and wayes of living wight 

When gentle Una saw the second fall
Of her deare knight who wearie of long fight
And faint through losse of blood mov'd not at all
But lay as in a dreame of deepe delight 
Besmeard with pretious Balme whose vertuous might
Did heale his wounds and scorching heat alay
Againe she stricken was with sore affright
And for his safetie gan devoutly pray

The joyous day gan early to appeare
And faire Aurora from the deawy bed
Of aged Tithone gan herselfe to reare
With rosy cheekes for shame as blushing red
Her golden locks for haste were loosely shed 
About her eares when Una her did marke
Clymbe to her charet all with flowers spred
From heaven high to chase the chearelesse darke

Then freshly up arose the doughtie knight 
All healed of his hurts and woundes wide
And did himselfe to battell ready dight
Whose early foe awaiting him beside
To have devourd so soone as day he spyde
When now he saw himselfe so freshly reare 
As if late fight had nought him damnifyde
He woxe dismayd and gan his fate to feare

And in his first encounter gaping wide
He thought attonce him to have swallowd quight 
And rusht upon him with outragious pride
Who him r'encountring fierce as hauke in flight
Perforce rebutted backe The weapon bright
Taking advantage of his open jaw
Ran through his mouth with so importune might 
That deepe emperst his darksome hollow maw

So downe he fell and forth his life did breath
That vanisht into smoke and cloudes swift
So downe he fell that th' earth him underneath 
Did grone as feeble so great load to lift
So downe he fell as an huge rockie clift
Whose false foundation waves have washt away
With dreadfull poyse is from the mayneland rift
And rolling downe great Neptune doth dismay 

The knight himselfe even trembled at his fall
So huge and horrible a masse it seem'd
And his deare Ladie that beheld it all
Durst not approch for dread which she misdeem'd 
But yet at last whenas the direfull feend
She saw not stirre off-shaking vaine affright
She nigher drew and saw that joyous end
Then God she praysd and thankt her faithfull knight

BEHOLD I see the haven nigh at hand
To which I meane my wearie course to bend
Vere the maine shete and beare up with the land
The which afore is fairely to be kend
And seemeth safe from storms that may offend 
There this faire virgin wearie of her way
Must landed be now at her journeyes end
There eke my feeble barke a while may stay

Scarsely had Phoebus in the glooming East 
Yet harnessed his firie-footed teeme
Ne reard above the earth his flaming creast
When the last deadly smoke aloft did steeme
That signe of last outbreathed life did seeme
Unto the watchman on the castle wall 
Who thereby dead that balefull Beast did deeme
And to his Lord and Ladie lowd gan call

Uprose with hastie joy and feeble speed
That aged Sire the Lord of all that land 
And looked forth to weet if true indeede
Those tydings were as he did understand
Which whenas true by tryall he out found
He bad to open wyde his brazen gate
Which long time had bene shut and out of hond 
Proclaymed joy and peace through all his state

Then gan triumphant Trompets sound on hie
That sent to heaven the ecchoed report
Of their new joy and happie victorie 
Gainst him that had them long opprest with tort
And fast imprisoned in sieged fort
Then all the people as in solemne feast
To him assembled with one full consort
Rejoycing at the fall of that great beast 

Forth came that auncient Lord and aged Queene
Arayd in antique robes downe to the ground
And sad habiliments right well beseene
A noble crew about them waited round 
Of sage and sober Peres all gravely gownd
Whom farre before did march a goodly band
Of tall young men all hable armes to sownd
But now they laurell braunches bore in hand

Unto that doughtie Conquerour they came
And him before themselves prostrating low
Their Lord and Patrone loud did him proclame
And at his feet their laurell boughes did throw
Soone after them all dauncing on a row 
The comely virgins came with girlands dight
As fresh as flowres in medow greene do grow
When morning deaw upon their leaves doth light

And them before the fry of children young 
Their wanton sports and childish mirth did play
And to the Maydens sounding tymbrels sung
In well attuned notes a joyous lay
And made delightfull musicke all the way
Untill they came where that faire virgin stood 
As faire Diana in fresh sommers day
Beholds her Nymphes enraung'd in shadie wood

So she beheld those maydens meriment
With chearefull vew who when to her they came 
Themselves to ground with gracious humblesse bent
And her ador'd by honorable name
Lifting to heaven her everlasting fame
Then on her head they set a girland greene
And crowned her 'twixt earnest and 'twixt game 
Who in her self-resemblance well beseene

And after all the raskall many ran
Heaped together in rude rablement
To see the face of that victorious man 
Whom all admired as from heaven sent
And gazd upon with gaping wonderment
But when they came where that dead Dragon lay
Stretcht on the ground in monstrous large extent
The sight with idle feare did them dismay 

Some feard and fled some feard and well it faynd
One that would wiser seeme then all the rest
Warnd him not touch for yet perhaps remaynd
Some lingring life within his hollow brest 
Or in his wombe might lurke some hidden nest
Of many Dragonets his fruitfull seed
Another said that in his eyes did rest
Yet sparckling fire and bad thereof take heed

One mother when as her foolehardie chyld
Did come too neare and with his talants play
Halfe dead through feare her little babe revyld
And to her gossips gan in counsell say
How can I tell but that his talants may 
Yet scratch my sonne or rend his tender hand
So diversly themselves in vaine they fray
Whiles some more bold to measure him nigh stand

Thus flocked all the folke him round about 
The whiles that hoarie king with all his traine
Being arrived where that champion stout
After his foes defeasance did remaine
Him goodly greetes and faire does entertaine
With princely gifts of yvorie and gold 
And thousand thankes him yeelds for all his paine
Then when his daughter deare he does behold

And after to his Pallace he them brings
With shaumes and trompets and with Clarions sweet 
And all the way the joyous people sings
And with their garments strowes the paved street
Whence mounting up they find purveyance meet
Of all that royall Princes court became
And all the floore was underneath their feet 
Bespred with costly scarlot of great name

What needs me tell their feast and goodly guize
In which was nothing riotous nor vaine
What needs of dainty dishes to devize 
Of comely services or courtly trayne
My narrow leaves cannot in them containe
The large discourse of royall Princes state
Yet was their manner then but bare and plaine
For th' antique world excesse and pride did hate 

Then when with meates and drinkes of every kinde
Their fervent appetites they quenched had
That auncient Lord gan fit occasion finde
Of straunge adventures and of perils sad 
Which in his travell him befallen had
For to demaund of his renowmed guest
Who then with utt'rance grave and count'nance sad
From point to point as is before exprest

Great pleasures mixt with pittiful regard
That godly King and Queene did passionate
Whiles they his pittifull adventures heard
That oft they did lament his lucklesse state
And often blame the too importune fate 
That heaped on him so many wrathfull wreakes
For never gentle knight as he of late
So tossed was in fortunes cruell freakes

Then sayd the royall Pere in sober wise 
Deare Sonne great beene the evils which ye bore
From first to last in your late enterprise
That I note whether prayse or pitty more
For never living man I weene so sore
In sea of deadly daungers was distrest 
But since now safe ye seised have the shore
And well arrived are high God be blest

Ah dearest Lord said then that doughty knight
Of ease or rest I may not yet devize 
For by the faith which I to armes have plight
I bounden am streight after this emprize
As that your daughter can ye well advize
Backe to returne to that great Faerie Queene
And her to serve six yeares in warlike wize 
Gainst that proud Paynim king that workes her teene

Unhappie falles that hard necessitie
Quoth he the troubler of my happie peace
And vowed foe of my felicitie 
Ne I against the same can justly preace
But since that band ye cannot now release
Nor doen undo for vowes may not be vaine
Soone as the terme of those six yeares shall cease
Ye then shall hither backe returne againe 

Which for my part I covet to performe
In sort as through the world I did proclame
That whoso kild that monster most deforme
And him in hardy battaile overcame 
Should have mine onely daughter to his Dame
And of my kingdome heyre apparaunt bee
Therefore since now to thee perteines the same
By dew desert of noble chevalree

Then forth he called that his daughter faire
The fairest Un' his onely daughter deare
His onely daughter and his onely heyre
Who forth proceeding with sad sober cheare
As bright as doth the morning starre appeare 
Out of the East with flaming lockes bedight
To tell that dawning day is drawing neare
And to the world does bring long wished light

So faire and fresh as freshest flowre in May 
For she had layd her mournefull stole aside
And widow-like sad wimple throwne away
Wherewith her heavenly beautie she did hide
Whiles on her wearie journey she did ride
And on her now a garment she did weare 
All lilly white withoutten spot or pride
That seemd like silke and silver woven neare

The blazing brightnesse of her beauties beame
And glorious light of her sunshyny face 
To tell were as to strive against the streame
My ragged rimes are all too rude and bace
Her heavenly lineaments for to enchace
Ne wonder for her owne deare loved knight
All were she dayly with himselfe in place 
Did wonder much at her celestiall sight

So fairely dight when she in presence came
She to her Sire made humble reverence
And bowed low that her right well became 
And added grace unto her excellence
Who with great wisedome and grave eloquence
Thus gan to say But eare he thus had said
With flying speede and seeming great pretence
Came running in much like a man dismaid 

All in the open hall amazed stood
At suddeinnesse of that unwarie sight
And wondred at his breathlesse hastie mood
But he for nought would stay his passage right 
Till fast before the king he did alight
Where falling flat great humblesse he did make
And kist the ground whereon his foot was pight
Then to his hands that writ he did betake

To thee most mighty king of Eden faire
Her greeting sends in these sad lines addrest
The wofull daughter and forsaken heire
Of that great Emperour of all the West
And bids thee be advized for the best 
Ere thou thy daughter linck in holy band
Of wedlocke to that new unknowen guest
For he already plighted his right hand

To me sad mayd or rather widow sad 
He was affiaunced long time before
And sacred pledges he both gave and had
False erraunt knight infamous and forswore
Witnesse the burning Altars which he swore
And guiltie heavens of his bold perjury 
Which though he hath polluted oft of yore
Yet I to them for judgement just do fly

Therefore since mine he is or free or bond
Or false or trew or living or else dead 
Withhold O soveraine Prince your hasty hond
From knitting league with him I you aread
Ne weene my right with strength adowne to tread
Through weaknesse of my widowhed or woe
For truth is strong her rightfull cause to plead 
And shall find friends if need requireth soe

When he these bitter byting wordes had red
The tydings straunge did him abashed make
That still he sate long time astonished 
As in great muse ne word to creature spake
At last his solemne silence thus he brake
With doubtfull eyes fast fixed on his guest
Redoubted knight that for mine onely sake
Thy life and honour late adventurest 

What meane these bloody vowes and idle threats
Throwne out from womanish impatient mind
What heavens what altars what enraged heates
Here heaped up with termes of love unkind 
My conscience cleare with guilty bands would bind
High God be witnesse that I guiltlesse ame
But if your selfe Sir knight ye faultie find
Or wrapped be in loves of former Dame

To whom the Redcrosse knight this answere sent
My Lord my King be nought hereat dismayd
Till well ye wote by grave intendiment
What woman and wherefere doth me upbrayd
With breach of love and loyalty betrayd 
It was in my mishaps as hitherward
I lately traveild that unwares I strayd
Out of my way through perils straunge and hard

There did I find or rather I was found 
Of this false woman that Fidessa hight
Fidessa hight the falsest Dame on ground
Most false Duessa royall richly dight
That easy was to invegle weaker sight
Who by her wicked arts and wylie skill 
Too false and strong for earthly skill or might
Unwares me wrought unto her wicked will

Then stepped forth the goodly royall Mayd
And on the ground her selfe prostrating low 
With sober countenaunce thus to him sayd
O pardon me my soveraigne Lord to show
The secret treasons which of late I know
To have bene wroght by that false sorceresse
She onely she it is that earst did throw 
This gentle knight into so great distresse

And now it seemes that she suborned hath
This craftie messenger with letters vaine
To worke new woe and unprovided scath 
By breaking of the band betwixt us twaine
Wherein she used hath the practicke paine
Of this false footman clokt with simplenesse
Whom if ye please for to discover plaine
Ye shall him Archimago find I ghesse 

The king was greatly moved at her speach
And all with suddein indignation fraight
Bad on that Messenger rude hands to reach
Eftsoones the Gard which on his state did wait 
Attacht that faitor false and bound him strait
Who seeming sorely chauffed at his band
As chained Beare whom cruell dogs do bait
With idle force did faine them to withstand

But they him layd full low in dungeon deepe
And bound him hand and foote with yron chains
And with continual watch did warely keepe
Who then would thinke that by his subtile trains
He could escape fowle death or deadly paines 
Thus when that princes wrath was pacifide
He gan renew the late forbidden bains
And to the knight his daughter dear he tyde

His owne two hands the holy knots did knit 
That none but death for ever can devide
His owne two hands for such a turne most fit
The housling fire did kindle and provide
And holy water thereon sprinckled wide
At which the bushy Teade a groome did light 
And sacred lamp in secret chamber hide
Where it should not be quenched day nor night

Then gan they sprinckle all the posts with wine
And made great feast to solemnize that day 
They all perfumde with frankencense divine
And precious odours fetcht from far away
That all the house did sweat with great aray
And all the while sweete Musicke did apply
Her curious skill the warbling notes to play 
To drive away the dull Melancholy

During the which there was an heavenly noise
Heard sound through all the Pallace pleasantly
Like as it had bene many an Angels voice 
Singing before th' eternall Majesty
In their trinall triplicities on hye
Yet wist no creature whence that heavenly sweet
Proceeded yet eachone felt secretly
Himselfe thereby reft of his sences meet 

Great joy was made that day of young and old
And solemne feast proclaimd throughout the land
That their exceeding merth may not be told
Suffice it heare by signes to understand 
The usuall joyes at knitting of loves band
Thrise happy man the knight himselfe did hold
Possessed of his Ladies hart and hand
And ever when his eye did her behold

Her joyous presence and sweet company
In full content he there did long enjoy
Ne wicked envie ne vile gealosy
His deare delights were able to annoy
Yet swimming in that sea of blissfull joy 
He nought forgot how he whilome had sworne
In case he could that monstrous beast destroy
Unto his Faerie Queene backe to returne

Now strike your sailes ye jolly Mariners 
For we be come unto a quiet rode
Where we must land some of our passengers
And light this wearie vessell of her lode
Here she a while may make her safe abode
Till she repaired have her tackles spent 
And wants supplide And then againe abroad
On the long voyage whereto she is bent
