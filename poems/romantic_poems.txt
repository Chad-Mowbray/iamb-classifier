Hush'd are the winds and still the evening gloom
Not e'en a zephyr wanders through the grove
Whilst I return to view my Margaret tomb
And scatter flowers on the dust I love
Within this narrow cell reclines her clay
That clay where once such animation beam'd
The King of Terrors seiz'd her as his prey
Not worth nor beauty have her life redeem'd
Oh could that King of Terrors pity feel
Or Heaven reverse the dread decree of fate
Not here the mourner would his grief reveal
Not here the Muse her virtues would relate
But wherefore weep Her matchless spirit soars
Beyond where splendid shines the orb of day
And weeping angels lead her to those bowers
Where endless pleasures virtuous deeds repay
And shall presumptuous mortals Heaven arraign
And madly Godlike Providence accuse
Ah no far fly from me attempts so vain 
I'll ne'er submission to my God refuse
Yet is remembrance of those virtues dear
Yet fresh the memory of that beauteous face
Still they call forth my warm affection tear
Still in my heart retain their wonted place 
Where are those honours IDA once your own
When Probus fill'd your magisterial throne
As ancient Rome fast falling to disgrace
Hail'd a Barbarian in her Caesar place
So you degenerate share as hard a fate
And seat Pomposus where your Probus sate
Of narrow brain yet of a narrower soul 
Pomposus holds you in his harsh controul
Pomposus by no social virtue sway'd
With florid jargon and with vain parade
With noisy nonsense and new-fangled rules
Such as were ne'er before enforc'd in schools 
Mistaking pedantry for learning laws
He governs sanction'd but by self-applause
With him the same dire fate attending Rome
Ill-fated Ida soon must stamp your doom
Like her o'erthrown for ever lost to fame
No trace of science left you but the name
Oh Friend for ever lov'd for ever dear 
What fruitless tears have bathed thy honour'd bier
What sighs re-echo'd to thy parting breath
Whilst thou wast struggling in the pangs of death
Could tears retard the tyrant in his course
Could sighs avert his dart relentless force
Could youth and virtue claim a short delay
Or beauty charm the spectre from his prey
Thou still hadst liv'd to bless my aching sight
Thy comrade honour and thy friend delight
If yet thy gentle spirit hover nigh
The spot where now thy mouldering ashes lie
Here wilt thou read recorded on my heart
A grief too deep to trust the sculptor art
No marble marks thy couch of lowly sleep
But living statues there are seen to weep
Affliction semblance bends not o'er thy tomb
Affliction self deplores thy youthful doom
What though thy sire lament his failing line
A father sorrows cannot equal mine
Though none like thee his dying hour will cheer
Yet other offspring soothe his anguish here
But who with me shall hold thy former place
Thine image what new friendship can efface
Ah none a father tears will cease to flow
Time will assuage an infant brother woe
To all save one is consolation known
While solitary Friendship sighs alone
Since the refinement of this polish'd age
Has swept immoral raillery from the stage
Since taste has now expung'd licentious wit
Which stamp'd disgrace on all an author writ
Since now to please with purer scenes we seek
Nor dare to call the blush from Beauty cheek
Oh let the modest Muse some pity claim
And meet indulgence though she find not fame
Still not for her alone we wish respect 
Others appear more conscious of defect
To-night no vet'ran Roscii you behold
In all the arts of scenic action old
No COOKE no KEMBLE can salute you here
No SIDDONS draw the sympathetic tear
To-night you throng to witness the debut
Of embryo Actors to the Drama new
Here then our almost unfledg'd wings we try
Clip not our pinions ere the birds can fly
Failing in this our first attempt to soar
Drooping alas we fall to rise no more
Not one poor trembler only fear betrays
Who hopes yet almost dreads to meet your praise
But all our Dramatis Personae wait
In fond suspense this crisis of their fate
No venal views our progress can retard
Your generous plaudits are our sole reward
For these each Hero all his power displays 
Each timid Heroine shrinks before your gaze
Surely the last will some protection find 
None to the softer sex can prove unkind
While Youth and Beauty form the female shield 
The sternest Censor to the fair must yield 
Yet should our feeble efforts nought avail
Should after all our best endeavours fail
Still let some mercy in your bosoms live
And if you can't applaud at least forgive
When slow Disease with all her host of Pains 
Chills the warm tide which flows along the veins
When Health affrighted spreads her rosy wing
And flies with every changing gale of spring
Not to the aching frame alone confin'd
Unyielding pangs assail the drooping mind
What grisly forms the spectre-train of woe
Bid shuddering Nature shrink beneath the blow
With Resignation wage relentless strife
While Hope retires appall'd and clings to life 
Yet less the pang when through the tedious hour
Remembrance sheds around her genial power
Calls back the vanish'd days to rapture given
When Love was bliss and Beauty form'd our heaven
Or dear to youth pourtrays each childish scene
Those fairy bowers where all in turn have been
As when through clouds that pour the summer storm
The orb of day unveils his distant form
Gilds with faint beams the crystal dews of rain
And dimly twinkles o'er the watery plain 
Thus while the future dark and cheerless gleams
The Sun of Memory glowing through my dreams
Though sunk the radiance of his former blaze
To scenes far distant points his paler rays
Still rules my senses with unbounded sway
The past confounding with the present day
Oft does my heart indulge the rising thought
Which still recurs unlook'd for and unsought
My soul to Fancy fond suggestion yields
And roams romantic o'er her airy fields 
Scenes of my youth develop'd crowd to view
To which I long have bade a last adieu
Seats of delight inspiring youthful themes
Friends lost to me for aye except in dreams
Some who in marble prematurely sleep
Whose forms I now remember but to weep
Some who yet urge the same scholastic course
Of early science future fame the source
Who still contending in the studious race
In quick rotation fill the senior place 
These with a thousand visions now unite
To dazzle though they please my aching sight 
IDA blest spot where Science holds her reign
How joyous once I join'd thy youthful train
Bright in idea gleams thy lofty spire
Again I mingle with thy playful quire
Our tricks of mischief every childish game
Unchang'd by time or distance seem the same
Through winding paths along the glade I trace
The social smile of every welcome face 
My wonted haunts my scenes of joy or woe
Each early boyish friend or youthful foe
Our feuds dissolv'd but not my friendship past 
I bless the former and forgive the last
Hours of my youth when nurtur'd in my breast
To Love a stranger Friendship made me blest 
Friendship the dear peculiar bond of youth
When every artless bosom throbs with truth
Untaught by worldly wisdom how to feign
And check each impulse with prudential rein 
When all we feel our honest souls disclose
In love to friends in open hate to foes
No varnish'd tales the lips of youth repeat
No dear-bought knowledge purchased by deceit
Hypocrisy the gift of lengthen'd years
Matured by age the garb of Prudence wears 
When now the Boy is ripen'd into Man
His careful Sire chalks forth some wary plan
Instructs his Son from Candour path to shrink
Smoothly to speak and cautiously to think 
Still to assent and never to deny 
A patron praise can well reward the lie
And who when Fortune warning voice is heard
Would lose his opening prospects for a word
Although against that word his heart rebel
And Truth indignant all his bosom swell
Away with themes like this not mine the task
From flattering friends to tear the hateful mask
Let keener bards delight in Satire sting
My Fancy soars not on Detraction wing 
Once and but once she aim'd a deadly blow
To hurl Defiance on a secret Foe
But when that foe from feeling or from shame
The cause unknown yet still to me the same
Warn'd by some friendly hint perchance retir'd
With this submission all her rage expired
From dreaded pangs that feeble Foe to save
She hush'd her young resentment and forgave
Or if my Muse a Pedant portrait drew
POMPOSUS' virtues are but known to few 
I never fear'd the young usurper nod
And he who wields must sometimes feel the rod
If since on Granta failings known to all
Who share the converse of a college hall
She sometimes trifled in a lighter strain
'Tis past and thus she will not sin again
Soon must her early song for ever cease
And all may rail when I shall rest in peace
Here first remember'd be the joyous band
Who hail'd me chief obedient to command 
Who join'd with me in every boyish sport
Their first adviser and their last resort
Nor shrunk beneath the upstart pedant frown 
Or all the sable glories of his gown 
Who thus transplanted from his father school
Unfit to govern ignorant of rule 
Succeeded him whom all unite to praise
The dear preceptor of my early days
PROBUS the pride of science and the boast 
To IDA now alas for ever lost 
With him for years we search'd the classic page 
And fear'd the Master though we lov'd the Sage
Retir'd at last his small yet peaceful seat
From learning labour is the blest retreat
POMPOSUS fills his magisterial chair
POMPOSUS governs but my Muse forbear
Contempt in silence be the pedant lot 
His name and precepts be alike forgot
No more his mention shall my verse degrade 
To him my tribute is already paid 
High through those elms with hoary branches crown'd 
Fair IDA'S bower adorns the landscape round
There Science from her favour'd seat surveys
The vale where rural Nature claims her praise
To her awhile resigns her youthful train
Who move in joy and dance along the plain
In scatter'd groups each favour'd haunt pursue
Repeat old pastimes and discover new
Flush'd with his rays beneath the noontide Sun
In rival bands between the wickets run 
Drive o'er the sward the ball with active force
Or chase with nimble feet its rapid course
But these with slower steps direct their way
Where Brent cool waves in limpid currents stray
While yonder few search out some green retreat
And arbours shade them from the summer heat
Others again a pert and lively crew
Some rough and thoughtless stranger plac'd in view
With frolic quaint their antic jests expose
And tease the grumbling rustic as he goes 
Nor rest with this but many a passing fray
Tradition treasures for a future day
'Twas here the gather'd swains for vengeance fought
And here we earn'd the conquest dearly bought
Here have we fled before superior might
And here renew'd the wild tumultuous fight
While thus our souls with early passions swell
In lingering tones resounds the distant bell
Th' allotted hour of daily sport is o'er
And Learning beckons from her temple door 
No splendid tablets grace her simple hall
But ruder records fill the dusky wall
There deeply carv'd behold each Tyro name
Secures its owner academic fame
Here mingling view the names of Sire and Son
The one long grav'd the other just begun
These shall survive alike when Son and Sire
Beneath one common stroke of fate expire 
Perhaps their last memorial these alone
Denied in death a monumental stone 
Whilst to the gale in mournful cadence wave
The sighing weeds that hide their nameless grave
And here my name and many an early friend's
Along the wall in lengthen'd line extends
Though still our deeds amuse the youthful race
Who tread our steps and fill our former place
Who young obeyed their lords in silent awe
Whose nod commanded and whose voice was law
And now in turn possess the reins of power
To rule the little Tyrants of an hour 
Though sometimes with the Tales of ancient day
They pass the dreary Winter eve away
And thus our former rulers stemm'd the tide
And thus they dealt the combat side by side
Just in this place the mouldering walls they scaled
Nor bolts nor bars against their strength avail'd
Here PROBUS came the rising fray to quell
And here he falter'd forth his last farewell
And here one night abroad they dared to roam
While bold POMPOSUS bravely staid at home 
While thus they speak the hour must soon arrive
When names of these like ours alone survive
Yet a few years one general wreck will whelm
The faint remembrance of our fairy realm
Dear honest race though now we meet no more
One last long look on what we were before 
Our first kind greetings and our last adieu 
Drew tears from eyes unus'd to weep with you
Through splendid circles Fashion gaudy world
Where Folly glaring standard waves unfurl'd 
I plung'd to drown in noise my fond regret
And all I sought or hop'd was to forget
Vain wish if chance some well-remember'd face
Some old companion of my early race
Advanc'd to claim his friend with honest joy
My eyes my heart proclaim'd me still a boy
The glittering scene the fluttering groups around
Were quite forgotten when my friend was found
The smiles of Beauty for alas I've known
What 'tis to bend before Love mighty throne 
The smiles of Beauty though those smiles were dear
Could hardly charm me when that friend was near
My thoughts bewilder'd in the fond surprise
The woods of IDA danc'd before my eyes
I saw the sprightly wand'rers pour along
I saw and join'd again the joyous throng
Panting again I trac'd her lofty grove
And Friendship feelings triumph'd over Love
Yet why should I alone with such delight
Retrace the circuit of my former flight 
Is there no cause beyond the common claim
Endear'd to all in childhood very name
Ah sure some stronger impulse vibrates here
Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear
To one who thus for kindred hearts must roam
And seek abroad the love denied at home
Those hearts dear IDA have I found in thee
A home a world a paradise to me
Stern Death forbade my orphan youth to share
The tender guidance of a Father care 
Can Rank or e'en a Guardian name supply
The love which glistens in a Father eye
For this can Wealth or Title sound atone
Made by a Parent early loss my own
What Brother springs a Brother love to seek
What Sister gentle kiss has prest my cheek
For me how dull the vacant moments rise
To no fond bosom link'd by kindred ties
Oft in the progress of some fleeting dream
Fraternal smiles collected round me seem 
While still the visions to my heart are prest
The voice of Love will murmur in my rest
I hear I wake and in the sound rejoice
I hear again but ah no Brother voice
A Hermit 'midst of crowds I fain must stray
Alone though thousand pilgrims fill the way
While these a thousand kindred wreaths entwine
I cannot call one single blossom mine
What then remains in solitude to groan
To mix in friendship or to sigh alone 
Thus must I cling to some endearing hand
And none more dear than IDA'S social band
Alonzo best and dearest of my friends 
Thy name ennobles him who thus commends
From this fond tribute thou canst gain no praise
The praise is his who now that tribute pays
Oh in the promise of thy early youth
If Hope anticipate the words of Truth
Some loftier bard shall sing thy glorious name
To build his own upon thy deathless fame 
Friend of my heart and foremost of the list
Of those with whom I lived supremely blest
Oft have we drain'd the font of ancient lore
Though drinking deeply thirsting still the more
Yet when Confinement lingering hour was done
Our sports our studies and our souls were one
Together we impell'd the flying ball
Together waited in our tutor hall
Together join'd in cricket manly toil
Or shar'd the produce of the river spoil 
Or plunging from the green declining shore
Our pliant limbs the buoyant billows bore 
In every element unchang'd the same
All all that brothers should be but the name
Nor yet are you forgot my jocund Boy
DAVUS the harbinger of childish joy
For ever foremost in the ranks of fun
The laughing herald of the harmless pun
Yet with a breast of such materials made
Anxious to please of pleasing half afraid 
Candid and liberal with a heart of steel
In Danger path though not untaught to feel
Still I remember in the factious strife
The rustic musket aim'd against my life 
High pois'd in air the massy weapon hung
A cry of horror burst from every tongue
Whilst I in combat with another foe
Fought on unconscious of th' impending blow
Your arm brave Boy arrested his career 
Forward you sprung insensible to fear 
Disarm'd and baffled by your conquering hand
The grovelling Savage roll'd upon the sand
An act like this can simple thanks repay 
Or all the labours of a grateful lay
Oh no whene'er my breast forgets the deed
That instant DAVUS it deserves to bleed
LYCUS on me thy claims are justly great
Thy milder virtues could my Muse relate
To thee alone unrivall'd would belong
The feeble efforts of my lengthen'd song 
Well canst thou boast to lead in senates fit
A Spartan firmness with Athenian wit
Though yet in embryo these perfections shine
LYCUS thy father fame will soon be thine
Where Learning nurtures the superior mind
What may we hope from genius thus refin'd
When Time at length matures thy growing years
How wilt thou tower above thy fellow peers
Prudence and sense a spirit bold and free
With Honour soul united beam in thee 
Shall fair EURYALUS pass by unsung
From ancient lineage not unworthy sprung
What though one sad dissension bade us part
That name is yet embalm'd within my heart
Yet at the mention does that heart rebound
And palpitate responsive to the sound
Envy dissolved our ties and not our will
We once were friends I'll think we are so still
A form unmatch'd in Nature partial mould
A heart untainted we in thee behold 
Yet not the Senate thunder thou shall wield
Nor seek for glory in the tented field
To minds of ruder texture these be given 
Thy soul shall nearer soar its native heaven
Haply in polish'd courts might be thy seat
But that thy tongue could never forge deceit
The courtier supple bow and sneering smile
The flow of compliment the slippery wile
Would make that breast with indignation burn
And all the glittering snares to tempt thee spurn 
Domestic happiness will stamp thy fate
Sacred to love unclouded e'er by hate
The world admire thee and thy friends adore 
Ambition slave alone would toil for more 
Now last but nearest of the social band
See honest open generous CLEON stand
With scarce one speck to cloud the pleasing scene
No vice degrades that purest soul serene
On the same day our studious race begun
On the same day our studious race was run 
Thus side by side we pass'd our first career
Thus side by side we strove for many a year
At last concluded our scholastic life
We neither conquer'd in the classic strife
As Speakers each supports an equal name 
And crowds allow to both a partial fame
To soothe a youthful Rival early pride
Though Cleon candour would the palm divide
Yet Candour self compels me now to own
Justice awards it to my Friend alone 
Oh Friends regretted Scenes for ever dear
Remembrance hails you with her warmest tear
Drooping she bends o'er pensive Fancy urn
To trace the hours which never can return
Yet with the retrospection loves to dwell 
And soothe the sorrows of her last farewell
Yet greets the triumph of my boyish mind
As infant laurels round my head were twin'd
When PROBUS' praise repaid my lyric song
Or plac'd me higher in the studious throng 
Or when my first harangue receiv'd applause 
His sage instruction the primeval cause
What gratitude to him my soul possest
While hope of dawning honours fill'd my breast 
For all my humble fame to him alone
The praise is due who made that fame my own
Oh could I soar above these feeble lays
These young effusions of my early days
To him my Muse her noblest strain would give
The song might perish but the theme might live 
Yet why for him the needless verse essay
His honour'd name requires no vain display
By every son of grateful IDA blest
It finds an echo in each youthful breast
A fame beyond the glories of the proud
Or all the plaudits of the venal crowd
IDA not yet exhausted is the theme
Nor clos'd the progress of my youthful dream
How many a friend deserves the grateful strain
What scenes of childhood still unsung remain 
Yet let me hush this echo of the past
This parting song the dearest and the last
And brood in secret o'er those hours of joy
To me a silent and a sweet employ
While future hope and fear alike unknown
I think with pleasure on the past alone
Yes to the past alone my heart confine
And chase the phantom of what once was mine
IDA still o'er thy hills in joy preside
And proudly steer through Time eventful tide 
Still may thy blooming Sons thy name revere
Smile in thy bower but quit thee with a tear 
That tear perhaps the fondest which will flow
O'er their last scene of happiness below
Tell me ye hoary few who glide along
The feeble Veterans of some former throng
Whose friends like Autumn leaves by tempests whirl'd
Are swept for ever from this busy world
Revolve the fleeting moments of your youth
While Care has yet withheld her venom'd tooth 
Say if Remembrance days like these endears
Beyond the rapture of succeeding years
Say can Ambition fever'd dream bestow
So sweet a balm to soothe your hours of woe
Can Treasures hoarded for some thankless Son
Can Royal Smiles or Wreaths by slaughter won
Can Stars or Ermine Man maturer Toys
For glittering baubles are not left to Boys
Recall one scene so much belov'd to view
As those where Youth her garland twin'd for you 
Ah no amid the gloomy calm of age
You turn with faltering hand life varied page
Peruse the record of your days on earth
Unsullied only where it marks your birth
Still lingering pause above each chequer'd leaf
And blot with Tears the sable lines of Grief
Where Passion o'er the theme her mantle threw
Or weeping Virtue sigh'd a faint adieu
But bless the scroll which fairer words adorn
Trac'd by the rosy finger of the Morn 
When Friendship bow'd before the shrine of truth
And Love without his pinion smil'd on Youth
Nisus the guardian of the portal stood
Eager to gild his arms with hostile blood
Well skill'd in fight the quivering lance to wield
Or pour his arrows thro' th' embattled field
From Ida torn he left his sylvan cave 
And sought a foreign home a distant grave
To watch the movements of the Daunian host
With him Euryalus sustains the post
No lovelier mien adorn'd the ranks of Troy
And beardless bloom yet grac'd the gallant boy 
Though few the seasons of his youthful life
As yet a novice in the martial strife
'Twas his with beauty Valour gifts to share 
A soul heroic as his form was fair
These burn with one pure flame of generous love
In peace in war united still they move
Friendship and Glory form their joint reward
And now combin'd they hold their nightly guard 
What God exclaim'd the first instils this fire
Or in itself a God what great desire 
My lab'ring soul with anxious thought oppress'd
Abhors this station of inglorious rest
The love of fame with this can ill accord
Be't mine to seek for glory with my sword
See'st thou yon camp with torches twinkling dim
Where drunken slumbers wrap each lazy limb
Where confidence and ease the watch disdain
And drowsy Silence holds her sable reign
Then hear my thought In deep and sullen grief
Our troops and leaders mourn their absent chief 
Now could the gifts and promised prize be thine
The deed the danger and the fame be mine
Were this decreed beneath yon rising mound
Methinks an easy path perchance were found
Which past I speed my way to Pallas' walls
And lead AEneas from Evander halls
With equal ardour fir'd and warlike joy
His glowing friend address'd the Dardan boy 
These deeds my Nisus shalt thou dare alone
Must all the fame the peril be thine own 
Am I by thee despis'd and left afar
As one unfit to share the toils of war
Not thus his son the great Opheltes taught
Not thus my sire in Argive combats fought
Not thus when Ilion fell by heavenly hate
I track'd AEneas through the walks of fate
Thou know'st my deeds my breast devoid of fear
And hostile life-drops dim my gory spear
Here is a soul with hope immortal burns
And life ignoble life for Glory spurns 
Fame fame is cheaply earn'd by fleeting breath
The price of honour is the sleep of death
Then Nisus Calm thy bosom fond alarms 
Thy heart beats fiercely to the din of arms
More dear thy worth and valour than my own
I swear by him who fills Olympus' throne
So may I triumph as I speak the truth
And clasp again the comrade of my youth
But should I fall and he who dares advance
Through hostile legions must abide by chance  
If some Rutulian arm with adverse blow
Should lay the friend who ever lov'd thee low
Live thou such beauties I would fain preserve 
Thy budding years a lengthen'd term deserve
When humbled in the dust let some one be
Whose gentle eyes will shed one tear for me
Whose manly arm may snatch me back by force
Or wealth redeem from foes my captive corse
Or if my destiny these last deny
If in the spoiler power my ashes lie 
Thy pious care may raise a simple tomb
To mark thy love and signalise my doom
Why should thy doating wretched mother weep
Her only boy reclin'd in endless sleep
Who for thy sake the tempest fury dar'd
Who for thy sake war deadly peril shar'd
Who brav'd what woman never brav'd before
And left her native for the Latian shore
In vain you damp the ardour of my soul
Replied Euryalus it scorns controul 
Hence let us haste their brother guards arose
Rous'd by their call nor court again repose
The pair buoy'd up on Hope exulting wing
Their stations leave and speed to seek the king
Now o'er the earth a solemn stillness ran
And lull'd alike the cares of brute and man
Save where the Dardan leaders nightly hold
Alternate converse and their plans unfold
On one great point the council are agreed
An instant message to their prince decreed 
Each lean'd upon the lance he well could wield
And pois'd with easy arm his ancient shield
When Nisus and his friend their leave request
To offer something to their high behest
With anxious tremors yet unaw'd by fear 
The faithful pair before the throne appear
Iulus greets them at his kind command
The elder first address'd the hoary band
With patience thus Hyrtacides began
Attend nor judge from youth our humble plan 
Where yonder beacons half-expiring beam
Our slumbering foes of future conquest dream 
Nor heed that we a secret path have trac'd
Between the ocean and the portal plac'd
Beneath the covert of the blackening smoke
Whose shade securely our design will cloak
If you ye Chiefs and Fortune will allow
We'll bend our course to yonder mountain brow
Where Pallas' walls at distance meet the sight
Seen o'er the glade when not obscur'd by night 
Then shall AEneas in his pride return
While hostile matrons raise their offspring urn
And Latian spoils and purpled heaps of dead
Shall mark the havoc of our Hero tread
Such is our purpose not unknown the way
Where yonder torrent devious waters stray
Oft have we seen when hunting by the stream
The distant spires above the valleys gleam
Mature in years for sober wisdom fam'd
Mov'd by the speech Alethes here exclaim'd  
Ye parent gods who rule the fate of Troy
Still dwells the Dardan spirit in the boy
When minds like these in striplings thus ye raise
Yours is the godlike act be yours the praise
In gallant youth my fainting hopes revive
And Ilion wonted glories still survive
Then in his warm embrace the boys he press'd
And quivering strain'd them to his aged breast
With tears the burning cheek of each bedew'd
And sobbing thus his first discourse renew'd  
What gift my countrymen what martial prize
Can we bestow which you may not despise
Our Deities the first best boon have given 
Internal virtues are the gift of Heaven
What poor rewards can bless your deeds on earth
Doubtless await such young exalted worth
AEneas and Ascanius shall combine
To yield applause far far surpassing mine
Iulus then By all the powers above
By those Penates who my country love 
By hoary Vesta sacred Fane I swear
My hopes are all in you ye generous pair
Restore my father to my grateful sight
And all my sorrows yield to one delight
Nisus two silver goblets are thine own
Sav'd from Arisba stately domes o'erthrown
My sire secured them on that fatal day
Nor left such bowls an Argive robber prey
Two massy tripods also shall be thine
Two talents polish'd from the glittering mine 
An ancient cup which Tyrian Dido gave
While yet our vessels press'd the Punic wave
But when the hostile chiefs at length bow down
When great AEneas wears Hesperia crown
The casque the buckler and the fiery steed
Which Turnus guides with more than mortal speed
Are thine no envious lot shall then be cast
I pledge my word irrevocably past
Nay more twelve slaves and twice six captive dames
To soothe thy softer hours with amorous flames 
And all the realms which now the Latins sway
The labours of to-night shall well repay
But thou my generous youth whose tender years
Are near my own whose worth my heart reveres
Henceforth affection sweetly thus begun
Shall join our bosoms and our souls in one
Without thy aid no glory shall be mine
Without thy dear advice no great design
Alike through life esteem'd thou godlike boy
In war my bulwark and in peace my joy 
To him Euryalus No day shall shame
The rising glories which from this I claim
Fortune may favour or the skies may frown
But valour spite of fate obtains renown
Yet ere from hence our eager steps depart
One boon I beg the nearest to my heart
My mother sprung from Priam royal line
Like thine ennobled hardly less divine
Nor Troy nor king Acestes' realms restrain
Her feeble age from dangers of the main 
Alone she came all selfish fears above 
A bright example of maternal love
Unknown the secret enterprise I brave
Lest grief should bend my parent to the grave
From this alone no fond adieus I seek
No fainting mother lips have press'd my cheek
By gloomy Night and thy right hand I vow
Her parting tears would shake my purpose now 
Do thou my prince her failing age sustain
In thee her much-lov'd child may live again 
Her dying hours with pious conduct bless
Assist her wants relieve her fond distress
So dear a hope must all my soul enflame 
To rise in glory or to fall in fame
Struck with a filial care so deeply felt
In tears at once the Trojan warriors melt
Faster than all Iulus' eyes o'erflow
Such love was his and such had been his woe
All thou hast ask'd receive the Prince replied
Nor this alone but many a gift beside 
To cheer thy mother years shall be my aim
Creusa style but wanting to the dame
Fortune an adverse wayward course may run
But bless'd thy mother in so dear a son
Now by my life my Sire most sacred oath 
To thee I pledge my full my firmest troth
All the rewards which once to thee were vow'd 
If thou should'st fall on her shall be bestow'd
Thus spoke the weeping Prince then forth to view
A gleaming falchion from the sheath he drew 
Lycaon utmost skill had grac'd the steel
For friends to envy and for foes to feel
A tawny hide the Moorish lion spoil 
Slain 'midst the forest in the hunter toil
Mnestheus to guard the elder youth bestows 
And old Alethes' casque defends his brows
Arm'd thence they go while all th' assembl'd train
To aid their cause implore the gods in vain 
More than a boy in wisdom and in grace
Iulus holds amidst the chiefs his place 
His prayer he sends but what can prayers avail
Lost in the murmurs of the sighing gale 
The trench is pass'd and favour'd by the night
Through sleeping foes they wheel their wary flight
When shall the sleep of many a foe be o'er
Alas some slumber who shall wake no more
Chariots and bridles mix'd with arms are seen
And flowing flasks and scatter'd troops between
Bacchus and Mars to rule the camp combine
A mingled Chaos this of war and wine 
Now cries the first for deeds of blood prepare
With me the conquest and the labour share
Here lies our path lest any hand arise
Watch thou while many a dreaming chieftain dies
I'll carve our passage through the heedless foe
And clear thy road with many a deadly blow
His whispering accents then the youth repress'd
And pierced proud Rhamnes through his panting breast
Stretch'd at his ease th' incautious king repos'd
Debauch and not fatigue his eyes had clos'd 
To Turnus dear a prophet and a prince
His omens more than augur skill evince
But he who thus foretold the fate of all
Could not avert his own untimely fall
Next Remus' armour-bearer hapless fell
And three unhappy slaves the carnage swell
The charioteer along his courser sides
Expires the steel his sever'd neck divides
And last his Lord is number'd with the dead
Bounding convulsive flies the gasping head 
From the swol'n veins the blackening torrents pour
Stain'd is the couch and earth with clotting gore
Young Lamyrus and Lamus next expire
And gay Serranus fill'd with youthful fire
Half the long night in childish games was pass'd 
Lull'd by the potent grape he slept at last
Ah happier far had he the morn survey'd
And till Aurora dawn his skill display'd 
In slaughter'd folds the keepers lost in sleep 
His hungry fangs a lion thus may steep 
'Mid the sad flock at dead of night he prowls
With murder glutted and in carnage rolls
Insatiate still through teeming herds he roams 
In seas of gore the lordly tyrant foams
Nor less the other deadly vengeance came
But falls on feeble crowds without a name
His wound unconscious Fadus scarce can feel
Yet wakeful Rhaesus sees the threatening steel
His coward breast behind a jar he hides
And vainly in the weak defence confides 
Full in his heart the falchion search'd his veins
The reeking weapon bears alternate stains
Through wine and blood commingling as they flow
One feeble spirit seeks the shades below
Now where Messapus dwelt they bend their way
Whose fires emit a faint and trembling ray
There unconfin'd behold each grazing steed
Unwatch'd unheeded on the herbage feed 
Brave Nisus here arrests his comrade arm
Too flush'd with carnage and with conquest warm 
Hence let us haste the dangerous path is pass'd
Full foes enough to-night have breath'd their last
Soon will the Day those Eastern clouds adorn
Now let us speed nor tempt the rising morn
What silver arms with various art emboss'd
What bowls and mantles in confusion toss'd
They leave regardless yet one glittering prize
Attracts the younger Hero wandering eyes
The gilded harness Rhamnes' coursers felt
The gems which stud the monarch golden belt 
This from the pallid corse was quickly torn
Once by a line of former chieftains worn
Th' exulting boy the studded girdle wears
Messapus' helm his head in triumph bears
Then from the tents their cautious steps they bend
To seek the vale where safer paths extend
Just at this hour a band of Latian horse
To Turnus' camp pursue their destin'd course
While the slow foot their tardy march delay
The knights impatient spur along the way 
Three hundred mail-clad men by Volscens led
To Turnus with their master promise sped
Now they approach the trench and view the walls
When on the left a light reflection falls
The plunder'd helmet through the waning night
Sheds forth a silver radiance glancing bright
Volscens with question loud the pair alarms 
Stand Stragglers stand why early thus in arms
From whence to whom He meets with no reply
Trusting the covert of the night they fly 
The thicket depth with hurried pace they tread
While round the wood the hostile squadron spread
With brakes entangled scarce a path between
Dreary and dark appears the sylvan scene
Euryalus his heavy spoils impede
The boughs and winding turns his steps mislead
But Nisus scours along the forest maze
To where Latinus' steeds in safety graze
Then backward o'er the plain his eyes extend
On every side they seek his absent friend 
O God my boy he cries of me bereft 
In what impending perils art thou left
Listening he runs above the waving trees
Tumultuous voices swell the passing breeze
The war-cry rises thundering hoofs around
Wake the dark echoes of the trembling ground
Again he turns of footsteps hears the noise 
The sound elates the sight his hope destroys
The hapless boy a ruffian train surround 
While lengthening shades his weary way confound 
Him with loud shouts the furious knights pursue
Struggling in vain a captive to the crew 
What can his friend 'gainst thronging numbers dare
Ah must he rush his comrade fate to share
What force what aid what stratagem essay
Back to redeem the Latian spoiler prey
His life a votive ransom nobly give
Or die with him for whom he wish'd to live
Poising with strength his lifted lance on high
On Luna orb he cast his frenzied eye  
Goddess serene transcending every star 
Queen of the sky whose beams are seen afar
By night Heaven owns thy sway by day the grove
When as chaste Dian here thou deign'st to rove
If e'er myself or Sire have sought to grace
Thine altars with the produce of the chase
Speed speed my dart to pierce yon vaunting crowd
To free my friend and scatter far the proud
Thus having said the hissing dart he flung
Through parted shades the hurtling weapon sung 
The thirsty point in Sulmo entrails lay
Transfix'd his heart and stretch'd him on the clay
He sobs he dies the troop in wild amaze
Unconscious whence the death with horror gaze
While pale they stare thro' Tagus' temples riven
A second shaft with equal force is driven
Fierce Volscens rolls around his lowering eyes
Veil'd by the night secure the Trojan lies 
Burning with wrath he view'd his soldiers fall
Thou youth accurst thy life shall pay for all 
Quick from the sheath his flaming glaive he drew
And raging on the boy defenceless flew
Nisus no more the blackening shade conceals
Forth forth he starts and all his love reveals
Aghast confus'd his fears to madness rise
And pour these accents shrieking as he flies
Me me your vengeance hurl on me alone
Here sheathe the steel my blood is all your own
Ye starry Spheres thou conscious Heaven attest
He could not durst not lo the guile confest 
All all was mine his early fate suspend
He only lov'd too well his hapless friend
Spare spare ye Chiefs from him your rage remove
His fault was friendship all his crime was love
He pray'd in vain the dark assassin sword
Pierced the fair side the snowy bosom gor'd
Lowly to earth inclines his plume-clad crest
And sanguine torrents mantle o'er his breast
As some young rose whose blossom scents the air
Languid in death expires beneath the share 
Or crimson poppy sinking with the shower
Declining gently falls a fading flower
Thus sweetly drooping bends his lovely head
And lingering Beauty hovers round the dead
But fiery Nisus stems the battle tide
Revenge his leader and Despair his guide 
Volscens he seeks amidst the gathering host
Volscens must soon appease his comrade ghost
Steel flashing pours on steel foe crowds on foe
Rage nerves his arm Fate gleams in every blow 
In vain beneath unnumber'd wounds he bleeds
Nor wounds nor death distracted Nisus heeds
In viewless circles wheel'd his falchion flies
Nor quits the hero grasp till Volscens dies
Deep in his throat its end the weapon found
The tyrant soul fled groaning through the wound 
Thus Nisus all his fond affection prov'd 
Dying revenged the fate of him he lov'd
Then on his bosom sought his wonted place 
And death was heavenly in his friend embrace 
Celestial pair if aught my verse can claim
Wafted on Time broad pinion yours is fame 
Ages on ages shall your fate admire
No future day shall see your names expire
While stands the Capitol immortal dome
And vanquished millions hail their Empress Rome
'Twas now the noon of night and all was still
Except a hapless Rhymer and his quill
In vain he calls each Muse in order down
Like other females these will sometimes frown
He frets be fumes and ceasing to invoke
The Nine in anguish'd accents thus he spoke
Ah what avails it thus to waste my time
To roll in Epic or to rave in Rhyme
What worth is some few partial readers' praise
If ancient Virgins croaking 'censures' raise
Where few attend 'tis useless to indite
Where few can read 'tis folly sure to write
Where none but girls and striplings dare admire
And Critics rise in every country Squire 
But yet this last my candid Muse admits
When Peers are Poets Squires may well be Wits
When schoolboys vent their amorous flames in verse
Matrons may sure their characters asperse
And if a little parson joins the train
And echos back his Patron voice again 
Though not delighted yet I must forgive
Parsons as well as other folks must live 
From rage he rails not rather say from dread
He does not speak for Virtue but for bread
And this we know is in his Patron giving
For Parsons cannot eat without a 'Living'
The Matron knows I love the Sex too well
Even unprovoked aggression to repel
What though from private pique her anger grew
And bade her blast a heart she never knew
What though she said for one light heedless line
That Wilmot verse was far more pure than mine
In wars like these I neither fight nor fly
When 'dames' accuse 'tis bootless to deny
Her be the harvest of the martial field
I can't attack where Beauty forms the shield
But when a pert Physician loudly cries
Who hunts for scandal and who lives by lies
A walking register of daily news
Train'd to invent and skilful to abuse 
For arts like these at bounteous tables fed
When S condemns a book he never read
Declaring with a coxcomb native air
The 'moral's' shocking though the 'rhymes' are fair
Ah must he rise unpunish'd from the feast
Nor lash'd by vengeance into truth at least
Such lenity were more than Man indeed
Those who condemn should surely deign to read
Yet must I spare nor thus my pen degrade
I quite forgot that scandal was his trade
For food and raiment thus the coxcomb rails
For those who fear his physic like his tales
Why should his harmless censure seem offence
Still let him eat although at my expense
And join the herd to Sense and Truth unknown
Who dare not call their very thoughts their own
And share with these applause a godlike bribe
In short do anything except prescribe 
For though in garb of Galen he appears
His practice is not equal to his years
Without improvement since he first began
A young Physician though an ancient Man 
Now let me cease Physician Parson Dame
Still urge your task and if you can defame
The humble offerings of my Muse destroy
And crush oh noble conquest crush a Boy
What though some silly girls have lov'd the strain
And kindly bade me tune my Lyre again
What though some feeling or some partial few
Nay Men of Taste and Reputation too
Have deign'd to praise the firstlings of my Muse 
If you your sanction to the theme refuse
If you your great protection still withdraw
Whose Praise is Glory and whose Voice is law
Soon must I fall an unresisting foe
A hapless victim yielding to the blow 
Thus Pope by Curl and Dennis was destroyed
Thus Gray and Mason yield to furious Lloyd 
From Dryden Milbourne tears the palm away
And thus I fall though meaner far than they
As in the field of combat side by side
A Fabius and some noble Roman died
This is the time when most divine to hear
The voice of Adoration rouses me
As with a Cherub trump and high upborne
Yea mingling with the Choir I seem to view
The vision of the heavenly multitude 
Who hymned the song of Peace o'er Bethlehem fields
Yet thou more bright than all the Angel-blaze
That harbingered thy birth Thou Man of Woes
Despised Galilaean For the Great
Invisible by symbols only seen 
With a peculiar and surpassing light
Shines from the visage of the oppressed good man
When heedless of himself the scourged saint
Mourns for the oppressor Fair the vernal mead
Fair the high grove the sea the sun the stars 
True impress each of their creating Sire
Yet nor high grove nor many-colour'd mead
Nor the green ocean with his thousand isles
Nor the starred azure nor the sovran sun
E'er with such majesty of portraiture 
Imaged the supreme beauty uncreate
As thou meek Saviour at the fearful hour
When thy insulted anguish winged the prayer
Harped by Archangels when they sing of mercy
Which when the Almighty heard from forth his throne 
Diviner light filled Heaven with ecstasy
Heaven hymnings paused and Hell her yawning mouth
Closed a brief momentLovely was the death
Of Him whose life was Love Holy with power
He on the thought-benighted Sceptic beamed 
Manifest Godhead melting into day
What floating mists of dark idolatry
Broke and misshaped the omnipresent Sire
And first by Fear uncharmed the drowsed Soul
Till of its nobler nature it 'gan feel 
Dim recollections and thence soared to Hope
Strong to believe whate'er of mystic good
The Eternal dooms for His immortal sons
From Hope and firmer Faith to perfect Love
Attracted and absorbed and centered there 
God only to behold and know and feel
Till by exclusive consciousness of God
All self-annihilated it shall make
God its Identity God all in all
We and our Father oneAnd blest are they 
Who in this fleshly World the elect of Heaven
Their strong eye darting through the deeds of men
Adore with steadfast unpresuming gaze
Him Nature essence mind and energy
And gazing trembling patiently ascend 
Treading beneath their feet all visible things
As steps that upward to their Father throne
Lead gradual else nor glorified nor loved
They nor contempt embosom nor revenge
For they dare know of what may seem deform 
The Supreme Fair sole operant in whose sight
All things are pure his strong controlling love
Alike from all educing perfect good
Their too celestial courage inly armed 
Dwarfing Earth giant brood what time they muse 
On their great Father great beyond compare
And marching onwards view high o'er their heads
His waving banners of Omnipotence
Who the Creator love created Might
Dread not within their tents no Terrors walk 
For they are holy things before the Lord
Aye unprofaned though Earth should league with Hell
God altar grasping with an eager hand
Fear the wild-visag'd pale eye-starting wretch
Sure-refug'd hears his hot pursuing fiends 
Yell at vain distance Soon refresh'd from Heaven
He calms the throb and tempest of his heart
His countenance settles a soft solemn bliss
Swims in his eye his swimming eye uprais'd
And Faith whole armour glitters on his limbs 
And thus transfigured with a dreadless awe
A solemn hush of soul meek he beholds
All things of terrible seeming yea unmoved
Views e'en the immitigable ministers
That shower down vengeance on these latter days 
For kindling with intenser Deity
From the celestial Mercy-seat they come
And at the renovating wells of Love
Have fill'd their vials with salutary wrath
To sickly Nature more medicinal 
Than what soft balm the weeping good man pours
Into the lone despoiled traveller wounds
Thus from the Elect regenerate through faith
Pass the dark Passions and what thirsty cares
Drink up the spirit and the dim regards 
Self-centre Lo they vanish or acquire
New names new features by supernal grace
Enrobed with Light and naturalised in Heaven
As when a shepherd on a vernal morn
Through some thick fog creeps timorous with slow foot 
Darkling he fixes on the immediate road
His downward eye all else of fairest kind
Hid or deformed But lo the bursting Sun
Touched by the enchantment of that sudden beam
Straight the black vapour melteth and in globes 
Of dewy glitter gems each plant and tree
On every leaf on every blade it hangs
Dance glad the new-born intermingling rays
And wide around the landscape streams with glory
There is one Mind one omnipresent Mind 
Omnific His most holy name is Love
Truth of subliming import with the which
Who feeds and saturates his constant soul
He from his small particular orbit flies
With blest outstarting From himself he flies 
Stands in the sun and with no partial gaze
Views all creation and he loves it all
And blesses it and calls it very good
This is indeed to dwell with the Most High
Cherubs and rapture-trembling Seraphim 
Can press no nearer to the Almighty throne
But that we roam unconscious or with hearts
Unfeeling of our universal Sire
And that in His vast family no Cain
Injures uninjured in her best-aimed blow 
Victorious Murder a blind Suicide
Haply for this some younger Angel now
Looks down on Human Nature and behold
A sea of blood bestrewed with wrecks where mad
Embattling Interests on each other rush 
With unhelmed rage'Tis the sublime of man
Our noontide Majesty to know ourselves
Parts and proportions of one wondrous whole
This fraternises man this constitutes
Our charities and bearings But 'tis God 
Diffused through all that doth make all one whole
This the worst superstition him except
Aught to desire Supreme Reality
The plenitude and permanence of bliss
O Fiends of Superstition not that oft 
The erring Priest hath stained with brother blood
Your grisly idols not for this may wrath
Thunder against you from the Holy One
But o'er some plain that steameth to the sun
Peopled with Death or where more hideous Trade 
Loud-laughing packs his bales of human anguish
I will raise up a mourning O ye Fiends
And curse your spells that film the eye of Faith
Hiding the present God whose presence lost
The moral world cohesion we become 
An Anarchy of Spirits Toy-bewitched
Made blind by lusts disherited of soul
No common centre Man no common sire
Knoweth A sordid solitary thing
Mid countless brethren with a lonely heart 
Through courts and cities the smooth savage roams
Feeling himself his own low self the whole
When he by sacred sympathy might make
The whole one Self Self that no alien knows
Self far diffused as Fancy wing can travel 
Self spreading still Oblivious of its own
Yet all of all possessing This is Faith
This the Messiah destined victory
But first offences needs must come Even now
Black Hell laughs horrible to hear the scoff 
Thee to defend meek Galilaean Thee
And thy mild laws of Love unutterable
Mistrust and Enmity have burst the bands
Of social peace and listening Treachery lurks
With pious fraud to snare a brother life 
And childless widows o'er the groaning land
Wail numberless and orphans weep for bread
Thee to defend dear Saviour of Mankind
Thee Lamb of God Thee blameless Prince of Peace
From all sides rush the thirsty brood of War  
Austria and that foul Woman of the North
The lustful murderess of her wedded lord
And he connatural Mind whom in their songs
So bards of elder time had haply feigned
Some Fury fondled in her hate to man 
Bidding her serpent hair in mazy surge
Lick his young face and at his mouth imbreathe
Horrible sympathy And leagued with these
Each petty German princeling nursed in gore
Soul-hardened barterers of human blood 
Death prime slave-merchants Scorpion-whips of Fate
Nor least in savagery of holy zeal
Apt for the yoke the race degenerate
Whom Britain erst had blushed to call her sons
Thee to defend the Moloch Priest prefers 
The prayer of hate and bellows to the herd
That Deity Accomplice Deity
In the fierce jealousy of wakened wrath
Will go forth with our armies and our fleets
To scatter the red ruin on their foes 
O blasphemy to mingle fiendish deeds
With blessednessLord of unsleeping Love
From everlasting Thou We shall not die
These even these in mercy didst thou form
Teachers of Good through Evil by brief wrong 
Making Truth lovely and her future might
Magnetic o'er the fixed untrembling heart
In the primeval age a dateless while
The vacant Shepherd wander'd with his flock
Pitching his tent where'er the green grass waved 
But soon Imagination conjured up
An host of new desires with busy aim
Each for himself Earth eager children toiled
So Property began twy-streaming fount
Whence Vice and Virtue flow honey and gall 
Hence the soft couch and many-coloured robe
The timbrel and arched dome and costly feast
With all the inventive arts that nursed the soul
To forms of beauty and by sensual wants
Unsensualised the mind which in the means 
Learnt to forget the grossness of the end
Best pleasured with its own activity
And hence Disease that withers manhood arm
The daggered Envy spirit-quenching Want
Warriors and Lords and Priests all the sore ills 
That vex and desolate our mortal life
Wide-wasting ills yet each the immediate source
Of mightier good Their keen necessities
To ceaseless action goading human thought
Have made Earth reasoning animal her Lord 
And the pale-featured Sage trembling hand
Strong as an host of armed Deities
Such as the blind Ionian fabled erst
From Avarice thus from Luxury and War
Sprang heavenly Science and from Science Freedom 
O'er waken'd realms Philosophers and Bards
Spread in concentric circles they whose souls
Conscious of their high dignities from God
Brook not Wealth rivalry and they who long
Enamoured with the charms of order hate 
The unseemly disproportion and whoe'er
Turn with mild sorrow from the Victor car
And the low puppetry of thrones to muse
On that blest triumph when the Patriot Sage
Called the red lightnings from the o'er-rushing cloud 
And dashed the beauteous terrors on the earth
Smiling majestic Such a phalanx ne'er
Measured firm paces to the calming sound
Of Spartan flute These on the fated day
When stung to rage by Pity eloquent men 
Have roused with pealing voice the unnumbered tribes
That toil and groan and bleed hungry and blind 
These hush'd awhile with patient eye serene
Shall watch the mad careering of the storm
Then o'er the wild and wavy chaos rush 
And tame the outrageous mass with plastic might
Moulding Confusion to such perfect forms
As erst were wont bright visions of the day 
To float before them when the summer noon
Beneath some arched romantic rock reclined 
They felt the sea-breeze lift their youthful locks
Or in the month of blossoms at mild eve
Wandering with desultory feet inhaled
The wafted perfumes and the flocks and woods
And many-tinted streams and setting sun 
With all his gorgeous company of clouds
Ecstatic gazed then homeward as they strayed
Cast the sad eye to earth and inly mused
Why there was misery in a world so fair
Ah far removed from all that glads the sense 
From all that softens or ennobles Man
The wretched Many Bent beneath their loads
They gape at pageant Power nor recognise
Their cots' transmuted plunder From the tree
Of Knowledge ere the vernal sap had risen 
Rudely disbranched Blessed Society
Fitliest depictured by some sun-scorched waste
Where oft majestic through the tainted noon
The Simoom sails before whose purple pomp
Who falls not prostrate dies And where by night 
Fast by each precious fountain on green herbs
The lion couches or hyaena dips
Deep in the lucid stream his bloody jaws
Or serpent plants his vast moon-glittering bulk
Caught in whose monstrous twine Behemoth yells 
His bones loud-crashingO ye numberless
Whom foul Oppression ruffian gluttony
Drives from Life plenteous feast O thou poor Wretch
Who nursed in darkness and made wild by want
Roamest for prey yea thy unnatural hand 
Dost lift to deeds of blood O pale-eyed form
The victim of seduction doomed to know
Polluted nights and days of blasphemy
Who in loathed orgies with lewd wassailers
Must gaily laugh while thy remembered Home 
Gnaws like a viper at thy secret heart
O aged Women ye who weekly catch
The morsel tossed by law-forced charity
And die so slowly that none call it murder
O loathly suppliants ye that unreceived 
Totter heart-broken from the closing gates
Of the full Lazar-house or gazing stand
Sick with despair O ye to Glory field
Forced or ensnared who as ye gasp in death
Bleed with new wounds beneath the vulture beak 
O thou poor widow who in dreams dost view
Thy husband mangled corse and from short doze
Start'st with a shriek or in thy half-thatched cot
Waked by the wintry night-storm wet and cold
Cow'rst o'er thy screaming baby Rest awhile 
Children of Wretchedness More groans must rise
More blood must stream or ere your wrongs be full
Yet is the day of Retribution nigh
The Lamb of God hath opened the fifth seal
And upward rush on swiftest wing of fire 
The innumerable multitude of wrongs
By man on man inflicted Rest awhile
Children of Wretchedness The hour is nigh
And lo the Great the Rich the Mighty Men
The Kings and the Chief Captains of the World 
With all that fixed on high like stars of Heaven
Shot baleful influence shall be cast to earth
Vile and down-trodden as the untimely fruit
Shook from the fig-tree by a sudden storm
Even now the storm begins each gentle name 
Faith and meek Piety with fearful joy
Tremble far-off for lo the Giant Frenzy
Uprooting empires with his whirlwind arm
Mocketh high Heaven burst hideous from the cell
Where the old Hag unconquerable huge 
Creation eyeless drudge black Ruin sits
Nursing the impatient earthquakeO return
Pure Faith meek Piety The abhorred Form
Whose scarlet robe was stiff with earthly pomp
Who drank iniquity in cups of gold 
Whose names were many and all blasphemous
Hath met the horrible judgment Whence that cry
The mighty army of foul Spirits shrieked
Disherited of earth For she hath fallen
On whose black front was written Mystery 
She that reeled heavily whose wine was blood
She that worked whoredom with the Daemon Power
And from the dark embrace all evil things
Brought forth and nurtured mitred Atheism
And patient Folly who on bended knee 
Gives back the steel that stabbed him and pale Fear
Haunted by ghastlier shapings than surround
Moon-blasted Madness when he yells at midnight
Return pure Faith return meek Piety
The kingdoms of the world are your each heart 
Self-governed the vast family of Love
Raised from the common earth by common toil
Enjoy the equal produce Such delights
As float to earth permitted visitants
When in some hour of solemn jubilee 
The massy gates of Paradise are thrown
Wide open and forth come in fragments wild
Sweet echoes of unearthly melodies
And odours snatched from beds of Amaranth
And they that from the crystal river of life 
Spring up on freshened wing ambrosial gales
The favoured good man in his lonely walk
Perceives them and his silent spirit drinks
Strange bliss which he shall recognise in heaven
And such delights such strange beatitudes 
Seize on my young anticipating heart
When that blest future rushes on my view
For in his own and in his Father might
The Saviour comes While as the Thousand Years
Lead up their mystic dance the Desert shouts 
Old Ocean claps his hands The mighty Dead
Rise to new life whoe'er from earliest time
With conscious zeal had urged Love wondrous plan
Coadjutors of God To Milton trump
The high groves of the renovated Earth 
Unbosom their glad echoes inly hushed
Adoring Newton his serener eye
Raises to heaven and he of mortal kind
Wisest he first who marked the ideal tribes
Up the fine fibres through the sentient brain 
Lo Priestley there patriot and saint and sage
Him full of years from his loved native land
Statesmen blood-stained and priests idolatrous
By dark lies maddening the blind multitude
Drove with vain hate Calm pitying he retired 
And mused expectant on these promised years
O Years the blest pre-eminence of Saints
Ye sweep athwart my gaze so heavenly bright
The wings that veil the adoring Seraphs' eyes
What time they bend before the Jasper Throne 
Reflect no lovelier hues Yet ye depart
And all beyond is darkness Heights most strange
Whence Fancy falls fluttering her idle wing
For who of woman born may paint the hour
When seized in his mid course the Sun shall wane 
Making noon ghastly Who of woman born
May image in the workings of his thought
How the black-visaged red-eyed Fiend outstretched
Beneath the unsteady feet of Nature groans
In feverous slumbers destined then to wake 
When fiery whirlwinds thunder his dread name
And Angels shout Destruction How his arm
The last great Spirit lifting high in air
Shall swear by Him the ever-living One
Time is no moreBelieve thou O my soul 
Life is a vision shadowy of Truth
And vice and anguish and the wormy grave
Shapes of a dream The veiling clouds retire
And lo the Throne of the redeeming God
Forth flashing unimaginable day 
Wraps in one blaze earth heaven and deepest hell
Contemplant Spirits ye that hover o'er
With untired gaze the immeasurable fount
Ebullient with creative Deity
And ye of plastic power that interfused 
Roll through the grosser and material mass
In organizing surge Holies of God
And what if Monads of the infinite mind
I haply journeying my immortal course
Shall sometime join your mystic choir Till then 
I discipline my young and novice thought
In ministeries of heart-stirring song
And aye on Meditation heaven-ward wing
Soaring aloft I breathe the empyreal air
Of Love omnific omnipresent Love 
Whose day-spring rises glorious in my soul
As the great Sun when he his influence
Sheds on the frost-bound waters The glad stream
Flows to the ray and warbles as it flows
Auspicious Reverence Hush all meaner song
Ere we the deep preluding strain have poured
To the Great Father only Rightful King
Eternal Father King Omnipotent
To the Will Absolute the One the Good 
The I AM the Word the Life the Living God
Such symphony requires best instrument
Seize then my soul from Freedom trophied dome
The Harp which hangeth high between the Shields
Of Brutus and Leonidas With that 
Strong music that soliciting spell force back
Man free and stirring spirit that lies entranced
For what is Freedom but the unfettered use
Of all the powers which God for use had given
But chiefly this him First him Last to view 
Through meaner powers and secondary things
Effulgent as through clouds that veil his blaze
For all that meets the bodily sense I deem
Symbolical one mighty alphabet
For infant minds and we in this low world 
Placed with our backs to bright Reality
That we may learn with young unwounded ken
The substance from its shadow Infinite Love
Whose latence is the plenitude of All
Thou with retracted beams and self-eclipse 
Veiling revealest thine eternal Sun
But some there are who deem themselves most free
When they within this gross and visible sphere
Chain down the winged thought scoffing ascent
Proud in their meanness and themselves they cheat 
With noisy emptiness of learned phrase
Their subtle fluids impacts essences
Self-working tools uncaused effects and all
Those blind Omniscients those Almighty Slaves
Untenanting creation of its God 
But Properties are God the naked mass
If mass there be fantastic guess or ghost
Acts only by its inactivity
Here we pause humbly Others boldlier think
That as one body seems the aggregate 
Of atoms numberless each organized
So by a strange and dim similitude
Infinite myriads of self-conscious minds
Are one all-conscious Spirit which informs
With absolute ubiquity of thought 
His one eternal self-affirming act
All his involved Monads that yet seem
With various province and apt agency
Each to pursue its own self-centering end
Some nurse the infant diamond in the mine 
Some roll the genial juices through the oak
Some drive the mutinous clouds to clash in air
And rushing on the storm with whirlwind speed
Yoke the red lightnings to their volleying car
Thus these pursue their never-varying course 
No eddy in their stream Others more wild
With complex interests weaving human fates
Duteous or proud alike obedient all
Evolve the process of eternal good
And what if some rebellious o'er dark realms 
Arrogate power yet these train up to God
And on the rude eye unconfirmed for day
Flash meteor-lights better than total gloom
As ere from Lieule-Oaive vapoury head
The Laplander beholds the far-off Sun 
Dart his slant beam on unobeying snows
While yet the stern and solitary Night
Brooks no alternate sway the Boreal Morn
With mimic lustre substitutes its gleam
Guiding his course or by Niemi lake 
Or Balda Zhiok or the mossy stone
Of Solfar-kapper while the snowy blast
Drifts arrowy by or eddies round his sledge
Making the poor babe at its mother back
Scream in its scanty cradle he the while 
Wins gentle solace as with upward eye
He marks the streamy banners of the North
Thinking himself those happy spirits shall join
Who there in floating robes of rosy light
Dance sportively For Fancy is the power 
That first unsensualises the dark mind
Giving it new delights and bids it swell
With wild activity and peopling air
By obscure fears of Beings invisible
Emancipates it from the grosser thrall 
Of the present impulse teaching Self-control
Till Superstition with unconscious hand
Seat Reason on her throne Wherefore not vain
Nor yet without permitted power impressed
I deem those legends terrible with which 
The polar ancient thrills his uncouth throng
Whether of pitying Spirits that make their moan
O'er slaughter'd infants or that Giant Bird
Vuokho of whose rushing wings the noise
Is Tempest when the unutterable Shape 
Speeds from the mother of Death and utters once
That shriek which never murderer heard and lived
Or if the Greenland Wizard in strange trance
Pierces the untravelled realms of Ocean bed
Over the abysm even to that uttermost cave 
By mis-shaped prodigies beleaguered such
As Earth ne'er bred nor Air nor the upper Sea
Where dwells the Fury Form whose unheard name
With eager eye pale cheek suspended breath
And lips half-opening with the dread of sound 
Unsleeping Silence guards worn out with fear
Lest haply 'scaping on some treacherous blast
The fateful word let slip the Elements
And frenzy Nature Yet the wizard her
Arm'd with Torngarsuck power the Spirit of Good 
Forces to unchain the foodful progeny
Of the Ocean stream thence thro' the realm of Souls
Where live the Innocent as far from cares
As from the storms and overwhelming waves
That tumble on the surface of the Deep 
Returns with far-heard pant hotly pursued
By the fierce Warders of the Sea once more
Ere by the frost foreclosed to repossess
His fleshly mansion that had staid the while
In the dark tent within a cow'ring group 
Untenanted Wild phantasies yet wise
On the victorious goodness of high God
Teaching reliance and medicinal hope
Till from Bethabra northward heavenly Truth
With gradual steps winning her difficult way 
Transfer their rude Faith perfected and pure
If there be Beings of higher class than Man
I deem no nobler province they possess
Than by disposal of apt circumstance
To rear up kingdoms and the deeds they prompt 
Distinguishing from mortal agency
They choose their human ministers from such states
As still the Epic song half fears to name
Repelled from all the minstrelsies that strike
The palace-roof and soothe the monarch pride 
And such perhaps the Spirit who if words
Witnessed by answering deeds may claim our faith
Held commune with that warrior-maid of France
Who scourged the Invader From her infant days
With Wisdom mother of retired thoughts 
Her soul had dwelt and she was quick to mark
The good and evil thing in human lore
Undisciplined For lowly was her birth
And Heaven had doomed her early years to toil
That pure from Tyranny least deed herself 
Unfeared by Fellow-natures she might wait
On the poor labouring man with kindly looks
And minister refreshment to the tired
Way-wanderer when along the rough-hewn bench
The sweltry man had stretched him and aloft 
Vacantly watched the rudely-pictured board
Which on the Mulberry-bough with welcome creak
Swung to the pleasant breeze Here too the Maid
Learnt more than Schools could teach Man shifting mind
His vices and his sorrows And full oft 
At tales of cruel wrong and strange distress
Had wept and shivered To the tottering Eld
Still as a daughter would she run she placed
His cold limbs at the sunny door and loved
To hear him story in his garrulous sort 
Of his eventful years all come and gone
So twenty seasons past The Virgin form
Active and tall nor Sloth nor Luxury
Had shrunk or paled Her front sublime and broad
Her flexile eye-brows wildly haired and low 
And her full eye now bright now unillumed
Spake more than Woman thought and all her face
Was moulded to such features as declared
That Pity there had oft and strongly worked
And sometimes Indignation Bold her mien 
And like an haughty huntress of the woods
She moved yet sure she was a gentle maid
And in each motion her most innocent soul
Beamed forth so brightly that who saw would say
Guilt was a thing impossible in her 
Nor idly would have said for she had lived
In this bad World as in a place of Tombs
And touched not the pollutions of the Dead
'Twas the cold season when the Rustic eye
From the drear desolate whiteness of his fields 
Rolls for relief to watch the skiey tints
And clouds slow-varying their huge imagery
When now as she was wont the healthful Maid
Had left her pallet ere one beam of day
Slanted the fog-smoke She went forth alone 
Urged by the indwelling angel-guide that oft
With dim inexplicable sympathies
Disquieting the heart shapes out Man course
To the predoomed adventure Now the ascent
She climbs of that steep upland on whose top 
The Pilgrim-man who long since eve had watched
The alien shine of unconcerning stars
Shouts to himself there first the Abbey-lights
Seen in Neufchatel vale now slopes adown
The winding sheep-track vale-ward when behold 
In the first entrance of the level road
An unattended team The foremost horse
Lay with stretched limbs the others yet alive
But stiff and cold stood motionless their manes
Hoar with the frozen night-dews Dismally 
The dark-red dawn now glimmered but its gleams
Disclosed no face of man The maiden paused
Then hailed who might be near No voice replied
From the thwart wain at length there reached her ear
A sound so feeble that it almost seemed 
Distant and feebly with slow effort pushed
A miserable man crept forth his limbs
The silent frost had eat scathing like fire
Faint on the shafts he rested She meantime
Saw crowded close beneath the coverture 
A mother and her children lifeless all
Yet lovely not a lineament was marred 
Death had put on so slumber-like a form
It was a piteous sight and one a babe
The crisp milk frozen on its innocent lips 
Lay on the woman arm its little hand
Stretched on her bosomMutely questioning
The Maid gazed wildly at the living wretch
He his head feebly turning on the group
Looked with a vacant stare and his eye spoke 
The drowsy calm that steals on worn-out anguish
She shuddered but each vainer pang subdued
Quick disentangling from the foremost horse
The rustic bands with difficulty and toil
The stiff cramped team forced homeward There arrived 
Anxiously tends him she with healing herbs
And weeps and prays but the numb power of Death
Spreads o'er his limbs and ere the noon-tide hour
The hovering spirits of his Wife and Babes
Hail him immortal Yet amid his pangs 
With interruptions long from ghastly throes
His voice had faltered out this simple tale
The Village where he dwelt an husbandman
By sudden inroad had been seized and fired
Late on the yester-evening With his wife 
And little ones he hurried his escape
They saw the neighbouring hamlets flame they heard
Uproar and shrieks and terror-struck drove on
Through unfrequented roads a weary way
But saw nor house nor cottage All had quenched 
Their evening hearth-fire for the alarm had spread
The air clipt keen the night was fanged with frost
And they provisionless The weeping wife
Ill hushed her children moans and still they moaned
Till Fright and Cold and Hunger drank their life 
They closed their eyes in sleep nor knew 'twas Death
He only lashing his o'er-wearied team
Gained a sad respite till beside the base
Of the high hill his foremost horse dropped dead
Then hopeless strengthless sick for lack of food 
He crept beneath the coverture entranced
Till wakened by the maiden Such his tale
Ah suffering to the height of what was suffered
Stung with too keen a sympathy the Maid
Brooded with moving lips mute startful dark 
And now her flushed tumultuous features shot
Such strange vivacity as fires the eye
Of Misery fancy-crazed and now once more
Naked and void and fixed and all within
The unquiet silence of confused thought 
And shapeless feelings For a mighty hand
Was strong upon her till in the heat of soul
To the high hill-top tracing back her steps
Aside the beacon up whose smouldered stones
The tender ivy-trails crept thinly there 
Unconscious of the driving element
Yea swallowed up in the ominous dream she sate
Ghastly as broad-eyed Slumber a dim anguish
Breathed from her look and still with pant and sob
Inly she toiled to flee and still subdued 
Felt an inevitable Presence near
Thus as she toiled in troublous ecstasy
A horror of great darkness wrapt her round
And a voice uttered forth unearthly tones
Calming her soul 'O Thou of the Most High 
Chosen whom all the perfected in Heaven
Behold expectant ''Maid beloved of Heaven
To her the tutelary Power exclaimed
Of Chaos the adventurous progeny 
Thou seest foul missionaries of foul sire
Fierce to regain the losses of that hour
When Love rose glittering and his gorgeous wings
Over the abyss fluttered with such glad noise
As what time after long and pestful calms 
With slimy shapes and miscreated life
Poisoning the vast Pacific the fresh breeze
Wakens the merchant-sail uprising Night
An heavy unimaginable moan
Sent forth when she the Protoplast beheld 
Stand beauteous on Confusion charmed wave
Moaning she fled and entered the Profound
That leads with downward windings to the Cave
Of Darkness palpable Desert of Death
Sunk deep beneath Gehenna massy roots 
There many a dateless age the Beldame lurked
And trembled till engendered by fierce Hate
Fierce Hate and gloomy Hope a Dream arose
Shaped like a black cloud marked with streaks of fire
It roused the Hell-Hag she the dew-damp wiped 
From off her brow and through the uncouth maze
Retraced her steps but ere she reached the mouth
Of that drear labyrinth shuddering she paused
Nor dared re-enter the diminished Gulph
As through the dark vaults of some mouldered Tower 
Which fearful to approach the evening hind
Circles at distance in his homeward way
The winds breathe hollow deemed the plaining groan
Of prisoned spirits with such fearful voice
Night murmured and the sound through Chaos went 
Leaped at her call her hideous-fronted brood
A dark behest they heard and rushed on earth
Since that sad hour in Camps and Courts adored
Rebels from God and Tyrants o'er Mankind
Shrieked Fear of Cruelty the ghastly Dam
Feverous yet freezing eager-paced yet slow
As she that creeps from forth her swampy reeds
Ague the biform Hag when early Spring
Beams on the marsh-bred vapours
The sainted Heralds of Good Tidings fell
And thus they witnessed God But now the clouds
Treading and storms beneath their feet they soar
Higher and higher soar and soaring sing 
Loud songs of triumph O ye Spirits of God
Hover around my mortal agonies
She spake and instantly faint melody
Melts on her ear soothing and sad and slow
Such measures as at calmest midnight heard 
By aged Hermit in his holy dream
Foretell and solace death and now they rise
Louder as when with harp and mingled voice
The white-robed multitude of slaughtered saints
At Heaven wide-open'd portals gratulant 
Receive some martyred patriot The harmony
Entranced the Maid till each suspended sense
Brief slumber seized and confused ecstasy
At length awakening slow she gazed around
And through a mist the relict of that trance 
Still thinning as she gazed an Isle appeared
Its high o'er-hanging white broad-breasted cliffs
Glassed on the subject ocean A vast plain
Stretched opposite where ever and anon
The plough-man following sad his meagre team 
Turned up fresh sculls unstartled and the bones
Of fierce hate-breathing combatants who there
All mingled lay beneath the common earth
Death gloomy reconcilement O'er the fields
Stept a fair Form repairing all she might 
Her temples olive-wreathed and where she trod
Fresh flowerets rose and many a foodful herb
But wan her cheek her footsteps insecure
And anxious pleasure beamed in her faint eye
As she had newly left a couch of pain 
Pale Convalescent Yet some time to rule
With power exclusive o'er the willing world
That blessed prophetic mandate then fulfilled 
Peace be on Earth An happy while but brief
She seemed to wander with assiduous feet 
And healed the recent harm of chill and blight
And nursed each plant that fair and virtuous grew
But soon a deep precursive sound moaned hollow
Black rose the clouds and now as in a dream
Their reddening shapes transformed to Warrior-hosts 
Coursed o'er the sky and battled in mid-air
Nor did not the large blood-drops fall from Heaven
Portentous while aloft were seen to float
Like hideous features looming on the mist
Wan stains of ominous light Resigned yet sad 
The fair Form bowed her olive-crowned brow
Then o'er the plain with oft-reverted eye
Fled till a place of Tombs she reached and there
Within a ruined Sepulchre obscure
Gazed through her tears then in sad tones exclaimed 
Thou mild-eyed Form wherefore ah wherefore fled
The Power of Justice like a name all light
Shone from thy brow but all they who unblamed
Dwelt in thy dwellings call thee Happiness 
Ah why uninjured and unprofited
Should multitudes against their brethren rush
Why sow they guilt still reaping misery
Lenient of care thy songs O Peace are sweet
As after showers the perfumed gale of eve 
That flings the cool drops on a feverous cheek
And gay thy grassy altar piled with fruits
But boasts the shrine of Daemon War one charm
Save that with many an orgie strange and foul
Dancing around with interwoven arms 
The Maniac Suicide and Giant Murder
Exult in their fierce union I am sad
And know not why the simple peasants crowd
Beneath the Chieftains' standard' Thus the Maid
To her the tutelary Spirit said 
'When Luxury and Lust exhausted stores
No more can rouse the appetites of kings
When the low flattery of their reptile lords
Falls flat and heavy on the accustomed ear
When eunuchs sing and fools buffoonery make 
And dancers writhe their harlot-limbs in vain
Then War and all its dread vicissitudes
Pleasingly agitate their stagnant hearts
Its hopes its fears its victories its defeats
Insipid Royalty keen condiment 
Therefore uninjured and unprofited
Victims at once and executioners
The congregated Husbandmen lay waste
The vineyard and the harvest As along
The Bothnic coast or southward of the Line 
Though hushed the winds and cloudless the high noon
Yet if Leviathan weary of ease
In sports unwieldy toss his island-bulk
Ocean behind him billows and before
A storm of waves breaks foamy on the strand 
And hence for times and seasons bloody and dark
Short Peace shall skin the wounds of causeless War
And War his strained sinews knit anew
Still violate the unfinished works of Peace
But yonder look for more demands thy view' 
He said and straightway from the opposite Isle
A vapour sailed as when a cloud exhaled
From Egypt fields that steam hot pestilence
Travels the sky for many a trackless league
Till o'er some death-doomed land distant in vain 
It broods incumbent Forthwith from the plain
Facing the Isle a brighter cloud arose
And steered its course which way the vapour went
The Maiden paused musing what this might mean
But long time passed not ere that brighter cloud 
Returned more bright along the plain it swept
And soon from forth its bursting sides emerged
A dazzling form broad-bosomed bold of eye
And wild her hair save where with laurels bound
Not more majestic stood the healing God 
When from his bow the arrow sped that slew
Huge Python Shriek'd Ambition giant throng
And with them hissed the locust-fiends that crawled
And glittered in Corruption slimy track
Great was their wrath for short they knew their reign 
And such commotion made they and uproar
As when the mad Tornado bellows through
The guilty islands of the western main
What time departing from their native shores
Eboe or Koromantyn plain of palms 
The infuriate spirits of the murdered make
Fierce merriment and vengeance ask of Heaven
Warmed with new influence the unwholesome plain
Sent up its foulest fogs to meet the morn
The Sun that rose on Freedom rose in Blood 
'Maiden beloved and Delegate of Heaven
To her the tutelary Spirit said
Soon shall the Morning struggle into Day
The stormy Morning into cloudless Noon
Much hast thou seen nor all canst understand  
But this be thy best omen Save thy Country
Thus saying from the answering Maid he passed
And with him disappeared the heavenly Vision
'Glory to Thee Father of Earth and Heaven
All-conscious Presence of the Universe 
Nature vast ever-acting Energy
In will in deed Impulse of All to All
Whether thy Love with unrefracted ray
Beam on the Prophet purged eye or if
Diseasing realms the Enthusiast wild of thought 
Scatter new frenzies on the infected throng
Thou both inspiring and predooming both
Fit instruments and best of perfect end
Glory to Thee Father of Earth and Heaven
More wild and waste and desolate than where
The white bear drifting on a field of ice
Howls to her sundered cubs with piteous rage
And savage agony
A mount not wearisome and bare and steep
But a green mountain variously up-piled
Where o'er the jutting rocks soft mosses creep
Or colour'd lichens with slow oozing weep
Where cypress and the darker yew start wild 
And 'mid the summer torrent gentle dash
Dance brighten'd the red clusters of the ash
Beneath whose boughs by those still sounds beguil'd
Calm Pensiveness might muse herself to sleep
Till haply startled by some fleecy dam 
That rustling on the bushy cliff above
With melancholy bleat of anxious love
Made meek enquiry for her wandering lamb
Such a green mountain 'twere most sweet to climb
E'en while the bosom ach'd with loneliness  
How more than sweet if some dear friend should bless
The adventurous toil and up the path sublime
Now lead now follow the glad landscape round
Wide and more wide increasing without bound
O then 'twere loveliest sympathy to mark 
The berries of the half-uprooted ash
Dripping and bright and list the torrent dash 
Beneath the cypress or the yew more dark
Seated at ease on some smooth mossy rock
In social silence now and now to unlock 
The treasur'd heart arm linked in friendly arm
Save if the one his muse witching charm
Muttering brow-bent at unwatch'd distance lag
Till high o'er head his beckoning friend appears
And from the forehead of the topmost crag 
Shouts eagerly for haply there uprears
That shadowing Pine its old romantic limbs
Which latest shall detain the enamour'd sight
Seen from below when eve the valley dims
Tinged yellow with the rich departing light 
And haply bason'd in some unsunn'd cleft
A beauteous spring the rock collected tears
Sleeps shelter'd there scarce wrinkled by the gale
Together thus the world vain turmoil left
Stretch'd on the crag and shadow'd by the pine 
And bending o'er the clear delicious fount
Ah dearest youth it were a lot divine
To cheat our noons in moralising mood
While west-winds fann'd our temples toil-bedew'd
Then downwards slope oft pausing from the mount 
To some lone mansion in some woody dale
Where smiling with blue eye Domestic Bliss
Gives this the Husband that the Brother kiss
Thus rudely vers'd in allegoric lore
The Hill of Knowledge I essayed to trace 
That verdurous hill with many a resting-place
And many a stream whose warbling waters pour
To glad and fertilise the subject plains
That hill with secret springs and nooks untrod
And many a fancy-blest and holy sod 
Where Inspiration his diviner strains
Low-murmuring lay and starting from the rock's
Stiff evergreens whose spreading foliage mocks
Want barren soil and the bleak frosts of age
And Bigotry mad fire-invoking rage 
O meek retiring spirit we will climb
Cheering and cheered this lovely hill sublime
And from the stirring world up-lifted high
Whose noises faintly wafted on the wind
To quiet musings shall attune the mind 
And oft the melancholy theme supply
There while the prospect through the gazing eye
Pours all its healthful greenness on the soul
We'll smile at wealth and learn to smile at fame
Our hopes our knowledge and our joys the same 
As neighbouring fountains image each the whole
Then when the mind hath drunk its fill of truth
We'll discipline the heart to pure delight
Rekindling sober joy domestic flame
They whom I love shall love thee honour'd youth 
Now may Heaven realise this vision bright
The Frost performs its secret ministry
Unhelped by any wind The owlet cry
Came loud and hark again loud as before
The inmates of my cottage all at rest
Have left me to that solitude which suits 
Abstruser musings save that at my side
My cradled infant slumbers peacefully
'Tis calm indeed so calm that it disturbs
And vexes meditation with its strange
And extreme silentness Sea hill and wood 
This populous village Sea and hill and wood
With all the numberless goings-on of life
Inaudible as dreams the thin blue flame
Lies on my low-burnt fire and quivers not
Only that film which fluttered on the grate 
Still flutters there the sole unquiet thing
Methinks its motion in this hush of nature
Gives it dim sympathies with me who live
Making it a companionable form
Whose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit 
By its own moods interprets every where
Echo or mirror seeking of itself
And makes a toy of ThoughtBut O how oft
How oft at school with most believing mind
Presageful have I gazed upon the bars 
To watch that fluttering stranger and as oft
With unclosed lids already had I dreamt
Of my sweet birth-place and the old church-tower
Whose bells the poor man only music rang
From morn to evening all the hot Fair-day 
So sweetly that they stirred and haunted me
With a wild pleasure falling on mine ear
Most like articulate sounds of things to come
So gazed I till the soothing things I dreamt
Lulled me to sleep and sleep prolonged my dreams 
And so I brooded all the following morn
Awed by the stern preceptor face mine eye
Fixed with mock study on my swimming book
Save if the door half opened and I snatched
A hasty glance and still my heart leaped up 
For still I hoped to see the stranger face
Townsman or aunt or sister more beloved
My play-mate when we both were clothed alike
Dear Babe that sleepest cradled by my side
Whose gentle breathings heard in this deep calm 
Fill up the interspersed vacancies
And momentary pauses of the thought
My babe so beautiful it thrills my heart
With tender gladness thus to look at thee
And think that thou shalt learn far other lore 
And in far other scenes For I was reared
In the great city pent 'mid cloisters dim
And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars
But thou my babe shalt wander like a breeze
By lakes and sandy shores beneath the crags 
Of ancient mountain and beneath the clouds
Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores
And mountain crags so shalt thou see and hear
The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible
Of that eternal language which thy God 
Utters who from eternity doth teach
Himself in all and all things in himself
Great universal Teacher he shall mould
Thy spirit and by giving make it ask
Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee 
Whether the summer clothe the general earth
With greenness or the redbreast sit and sing
Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch
Of mossy apple-tree while the nigh thatch
Smokes in the sun-thaw whether the eave-drops fall 
Heard only in the trances of the blast
Or if the secret ministry of frost
Shall hang them up in silent icicles
Quietly shining to the quiet Moon
Stranger whose eyes a look of pity shew
Say will you listen to a tale of woe
A tale in no unwonted horrors drest
But sweet is pity to an aged breast
This voice did falter with old age before 
Sad recollections make it falter more
Beside the torrent and beneath a wood
High in these Alps my summer cottage stood
One daughter still remain'd to cheer my way
The evening-star of life declining day 
Duly she hied to fill her milking-pail
Ere shout of herdsmen rang from cliff or vale
When she return'd before the summer shiel
On the fresh grass she spread the dairy meal
Just as the snowy peaks began to lose 
In glittering silver lights their rosy hues
Singing in woods or bounding o'er the lawn
No blither creature hail'd the early dawn
And if I spoke of hearts by pain oppress'd
When every friend is gone to them that rest 
Or of old men that leave when they expire
Daughters that should have perish'd with their sire 
Leave them to toil all day through paths unknown
And house at night behind some sheltering stone
Impatient of the thought with lively cheer 
She broke half-closed the tasteless tale severe
She play'd with fancies of a gayer hue
Enamour'd of the scenes her wishes drew
And oft she prattled with an eager tongue
Of promised joys that would not loiter long 
Till with her tearless eyes so bright and fair
She seem'd to see them realis'd in air
In fancy oft within some sunny dell
Where never wolf should howl or tempest yell
She built a little home of joy and rest 
And fill'd it with the friends whom she lov'd best
She named the inmates of her fancied cot
And gave to each his own peculiar lot
Which with our little herd abroad should roam
And which should tend the dairy toil at home 
And now the hour approach'd which should restore
Her lover from the wars to part no more
Her whole frame fluttered with uneasy joy
I long'd myself to clasp the valiant boy
And though I strove to calm her eager mood 
It was my own sole thought in solitude
I told it to the Saints amid my hymns 
For O you know not on an old man limbs
How thrillingly the pleasant sun-beams play
That shine upon his daughter wedding-day 
I hoped that those fierce tempests soon to rave
Unheard unfelt around my mountain grave
Not undelightfully would break her rest
While she lay pillow'd on her lover breast
Or join'd his pious prayer for pilgrims driven 
Out to the mercy of the winds of heaven
Yes now the hour approach'd that should restore
Her lover from the wars to part no more
Her thoughts were wild her soul was in her eye
She wept and laugh'd as if she knew not why 
And she had made a song about the wars
And sang it to the sun and to the stars
But while she look'd and listen'd stood and ran
And saw him plain in every distant man
By treachery stabbed on NANSY'S murderous day 
A senseless corse th' expected husband lay
A wounded man who met us in the wood
Heavily ask'd her where my cottage stood
And told us all she cast her eyes around
As if his words had been but empty sound 
Then look'd to Heav'n like one that would deny
That such a thing could be beneath the sky
Again he ask'd her if she knew my name
And instantly an anguish wrench'd her frame
And left her mind imperfect No delight 
Thenceforth she found in any cheerful sight
Not ev'n in those time-haunted wells and groves
Scenes of past joy and birth-place of her loves
If to her spirit any sound was dear
'Twas the deep moan that spoke the tempest near 
Or sighs which chasms of icy vales outbreathe
Sent from the dark imprison'd floods beneath
She wander'd up the crag and down the slope
But not as in her happy days of hope
To seek the churning-plant of sovereign power 
That grew in clefts and bore a scarlet flower
She roam'd without a purpose all alone
Thro' high grey vales unknowing and unknown
Kind-hearted stranger patiently you hear
A tedious tale I thank you for that tear 
May never other tears o'ercloud your eye
Than those which gentle Pity can supply
Did you not mark a towering convent hang
Where the huge rocks with sounds of torrents rang
Ev'n yet methinks its spiry turrets swim 
Amid yon purple gloom ascending dim
For thither oft would my poor child repair
To ease her soul by penitence and prayer
I knew that peace at good men prayers returns
Home to the contrite heart of him that mourns 
And check'd her not and often there she found
A timely pallet when the evening frown'd
And there I trusted that my child would light
On shelter and on food one dreadful night
When there was uproar in the element 
And she was absent To my rest I went
I thought her safe yet often did I wake
And felt my very heart within me ache
No daughter near me at this very door
Next morn I listen'd to the dying roar 
Above below the prowling vulture wail'd
And down the cliffs the heavy vapour sail'd
Up by the wide-spread waves in fury torn
Homestalls and pines along the vale were borne
The Dalesmen in thick crowds appear'd below 
Clearing the road o'erwhelm'd with hills of snow
At times to the proud gust ascending swell
A pack of blood-hounds flung their doleful yell
For after nights of storm that dismal train
The pious convent sends with hope humane 
To find some out-stretch'd man perchance to save
Or give at least that last good gift a grave
But now a gathering crowd did I survey
That slowly up the pasture bent their way
Nor could I doubt but that their care had found 
Some pilgrim in th' unchannel'd torrent drown'd
And down the lawn I hasten'd to implore
That they would bring the body to my door
But soon exclaim'd a boy who ran before
'Thrown by the last night waters from their bed 
Your daughter has been found and she is dead
The old man paused May he who sternly just
Lays at his will his creatures in the dust
Some ere the earliest buds of hope be blown
And some when every bloom of joy is flown 
May he the parent to his child restore
In that unchanging realm where Love reigns evermore
A green and silent spot amid the hills
A small and silent dell O'er stiller place
No singing sky-lark ever poised himself
The hills are heathy save that swelling slope
Which hath a gay and gorgeous covering on 
All golden with the never-bloomless furze
Which now blooms most profusely but the dell
Bathed by the mist is fresh and delicate
As vernal corn-field or the unripe flax
When through its half-transparent stalks at eve 
The level sunshine glimmers with green light
Oh 'tis a quiet spirit-healing nook
Which all methinks would love but chiefly he
The humble man who in his youthful years
Knew just so much of folly as had made 
His early manhood more securely wise
Here he might lie on fern or withered heath
While from the singing lark that sings unseen
The minstrelsy that solitude loves best
And from the sun and from the breezy air 
Sweet influences trembled o'er his frame
And he with many feelings many thoughts
Made up a meditative joy and found
Religious meanings in the forms of Nature
And so his senses gradually wrapt 
In a half sleep he dreams of better worlds
And dreaming hears thee still O singing lark
That singest like an angel in the clouds
My God it is a melancholy thing
For such a man who would full fain preserve 
His soul in calmness yet perforce must feel
For all his human brethren O my God
It weighs upon the heart that he must think
What uproar and what strife may now be stirring
This way or that way o'er these silent hills  
Invasion and the thunder and the shout
And all the crash of onset fear and rage
And undetermined conflict even now
Even now perchance and in his native isle
Carnage and groans beneath this blessed sun 
We have offended Oh my countrymen
We have offended very grievously
And been most tyrannous From east to west
A groan of accusation pierces Heaven
The wretched plead against us multitudes 
Countless and vehement the sons of God
Our brethren Like a cloud that travels on
Steamed up from Cairo swamps of pestilence
Even so my countrymen have we gone forth
And borne to distant tribes slavery and pangs 
And deadlier far our vices whose deep taint
With slow perdition murders the whole man
His body and his soul Meanwhile at home
All individual dignity and power
Engulfed in Courts Committees Institutions 
Associations and Societies
A vain speech-mouthing speech-reporting Guild
One Benefit-Club for mutual flattery
We have drunk up demure as at a grace
Pollutions from the brimming cup of wealth 
Contemptuous of all honourable rule
Yet bartering freedom and the poor man life
For gold as at a market The sweet words
Of Christian promise words that even yet
Might stem destruction were they wisely preached 
Are muttered o'er by men whose tones proclaim
How flat and wearisome they feel their trade
Rank scoffers some but most too indolent
To deem them falsehoods or to know their truth
Oh blasphemous the Book of Life is made 
A superstitious instrument on which
We gabble o'er the oaths we mean to break
For all must swear all and in every place
College and wharf council and justice-court
All all must swear the briber and the bribed 
Merchant and lawyer senator and priest
The rich the poor the old man and the young
All all make up one scheme of perjury
That faith doth reel the very name of God
Sounds like a juggler charm and bold with joy 
Forth from his dark and lonely hiding-place
Portentous sight the owlet Atheism
Sailing on obscene wings athwart the noon
Drops his blue-fringed lids and holds them close
And hooting at the glorious sun in Heaven 
Cries out 'Where is it'Thankless too for peace
Peace long preserved by fleets and perilous seas
Secure from actual warfare we have loved
To swell the war-whoop passionate for war
Alas for ages ignorant of all 
Its ghastlier workings famine or blue plague
Battle or siege or flight through wintry snows
We this whole people have been clamorous
For war and bloodshed animating sports
The which we pay for as a thing to talk of 
Spectators and not combatants No guess
Anticipative of a wrong unfelt
No speculation on contingency
However dim and vague too vague and dim
To yield a justifying cause and forth 
Stuffed out with big preamble holy names
And adjurations of the God in Heaven
We send our mandates for the certain death
Of thousands and ten thousands Boys and girls
And women that would groan to see a child 
Pull off an insect leg all read of war
The best amusement for our morning meal
The poor wretch who has learnt his only prayers
From curses who knows scarcely words enough
To ask a blessing from his Heavenly Father 
Becomes a fluent phraseman absolute
And technical in victories and defeats
And all our dainty terms for fratricide
Terms which we trundle smoothly o'er our tongues
Like mere abstractions empty sounds to which 
We join no feeling and attach no form
As if the soldier died without a wound
As if the fibres of this godlike frame
Were gored without a pang as if the wretch
Who fell in battle doing bloody deeds 
Passed off to Heaven translated and not killed
As though he had no wife to pine for him
No God to judge him Therefore evil days
Are coming on us O my countrymen
And what if all-avenging Providence 
Strong and retributive should make us know
The meaning of our words force us to feel
The desolation and the agony
Of our fierce doingsSpare us yet awhile
Father and God O spare us yet awhile 
Oh let not English women drag their flight
Fainting beneath the burthen of their babes
Of the sweet infants that but yesterday
Laughed at the breast Sons brothers husbands all
Who ever gazed with fondness on the forms 
Which grew up with you round the same fire-side
And all who ever heard the sabbath-bells
Without the infidel scorn make yourselves pure
Stand forth be men repel an impious foe
Impious and false a light yet cruel race 
Who laugh away all virtue mingling mirth
With deeds of murder and still promising
Freedom themselves too sensual to be free
Poison life amities and cheat the heart
Of faith and quiet hope and all that soothes 
And all that lifts the spirit Stand we forth
Render them back upon the insulted ocean
And let them toss as idly on its waves
As the vile sea-weed which some mountain-blast
Swept from our shores And oh may we return 
Not with a drunken triumph but with fear
Repenting of the wrongs with which we stung
So fierce a foe to frenzyI have told
O Britons O my brethren I have told
Most bitter truth but without bitterness 
Nor deem my zeal or factious or mistimed
For never can true courage dwell with them
Who playing tricks with conscience dare not look
At their own vices We have been too long
Dupes of a deep delusion Some belike 
Groaning with restless enmity expect
All change from change of constituted power
As if a Government had been a robe
On which our vice and wretchedness were tagged
Like fancy-points and fringes with the robe 
Pulled off at pleasure Fondly these attach
A radical causation to a few
Poor drudges of chastising Providence
Who borrow all their hues and qualities
From our own folly and rank wickedness 
Which gave them birth and nursed them Others meanwhile
Dote with a mad idolatry and all
Who will not fall before their images
And yield them worship they are enemies
Even of their countrySuch have I been deemed  
But O dear Britain O my Mother Isle
Needs must thou prove a name most dear and holy
To me a son a brother and a friend
A husband and a father who revere
All bonds of natural love and find them all 
Within the limits of thy rocky shores
O native Britain O my Mother Isle
How shouldst thou prove aught else but dear and holy
To me who from thy lakes and mountain-hills
Thy clouds thy quiet dales thy rocks and seas 
Have drunk in all my intellectual life
All sweet sensations all ennobling thoughts
All adoration of the God in nature
All lovely and all honourable things
Whatever makes this mortal spirit feel 
The joy and greatness of its future being
There lives nor form nor feeling in my soul
Unborrowed from my country O divine
And beauteous island thou hast been my sole
And most magnificent temple in the which 
I walk with awe and sing my stately songs
Loving the God that made me May my fears
My filial fears be vain and may the vaunts
And menace of the vengeful enemy
Pass like the gust that roared and died away 
In the distant tree which heard and only heard
In this low dell bowed not the delicate grass
But now the gentle dew-fall sends abroad
The fruit-like perfume of the golden furze
The light has left the summit of the hill 
Though still a sunny gleam lies beautiful
Aslant the ivied beacon Now farewell
Farewell awhile O soft and silent spot
On the green sheep-track up the heathy hill
Homeward I wind my way and lo recalled 
From bodings that have well-nigh wearied me
I find myself upon the brow and pause
Startled And after lonely sojourning
In such a quiet and surrounded nook
This burst of prospect here the shadowy main 
Dim-tinted there the mighty majesty
Of that huge amphitheatre of rich
And elmy fields seems like society 
Conversing with the mind and giving it
A livelier impulse and a dance of thought 
And now beloved Stowey I behold
Thy church-tower and methinks the four huge elms
Clustering which mark the mansion of my friend
And close behind them hidden from my view
Is my own lowly cottage where my babe 
And my babe mother dwell in peace With light
And quickened footsteps thitherward I tend
Remembering thee O green and silent dell
And grateful that by nature quietness
And solitary musings all my heart 
Is softened and made worthy to indulge
Love and the thoughts that yearn for human kind
Upon a time before the faery broods
Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods
Before King Oberon bright diadem
Sceptre and mantle clasp'd with dewy gem
Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns
From rushes green and brakes and cowslip'd lawns
The ever-smitten Hermes empty left
His golden throne bent warm on amorous theft
From high Olympus had he stolen light
On this side of Jove clouds to escape the sight 
Of his great summoner and made retreat
Into a forest on the shores of Crete
For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt
A nymph to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt
At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured
Pearls while on land they wither'd and adored
Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont
And in those meads where sometime she might haunt
Were strewn rich gifts unknown to any Muse
Though Fancy casket were unlock'd to choose 
Ah what a world of love was at her feet
So Hermes thought and a celestial heat
Burnt from his winged heels to either ear
That from a whiteness as the lily clear
Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair
Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare
From vale to vale from wood to wood he flew
Breathing upon the flowers his passion new
And wound with many a river to its head
To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed 
In vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found
And so he rested on the lonely ground
Pensive and full of painful jealousies
Of the Wood-Gods and even the very trees
There as he stood he heard a mournful voice
Such as once heard in gentle heart destroys
All pain but pity thus the lone voice spake
When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake
When move in a sweet body fit for life
And love and pleasure and the ruddy strife 
Of hearts and lips Ah miserable me
The God dove-footed glided silently
Round bush and tree soft-brushing in his speed
The taller grasses and full-flowering weed
Until he found a palpitating snake
Bright and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake
She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue
Vermilion-spotted golden green and blue
Striped like a zebra freckled like a pard
Eyed like a peacock and all crimson barr'd 
And full of silver moons that as she breathed
Dissolv'd or brighter shone or interwreathed
Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries 
So rainbow-sided touch'd with miseries
She seem'd at once some penanced lady elf
Some demon mistress or the demon self
Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire
Sprinkled with stars like Ariadne tiar
Her head was serpent but ah bitter-sweet
She had a woman mouth with all its pearls complete 
And for her eyes what could such eyes do there
But weep and weep that they were born so fair
As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air
Her throat was serpent but the words she spake
Came as through bubbling honey for Love sake
And thus while Hermes on his pinions lay
Like a stoop'd falcon ere he takes his prey
Fair Hermes crown'd with feathers fluttering light
I had a splendid dream of thee last night
I saw thee sitting on a throne of gold 
Among the Gods upon Olympus old
The only sad one for thou didst not hear
The soft lute-finger'd Muses chaunting clear
Nor even Apollo when he sang alone
Deaf to his throbbing throat long long melodious moan
I dreamt I saw thee robed in purple flakes
Break amorous through the clouds as morning breaks
And swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart
Strike for the Cretan isle and here thou art
Too gentle Hermes hast thou found the maid 
Whereat the star of Lethe not delay'd
His rosy eloquence and thus inquired
Thou smooth-lipp'd serpent surely high inspired
Thou beauteous wreath with melancholy eyes
Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise
Telling me only where my nymph is fled 
Where she doth breathe Bright planet thou hast said
Return'd the snake but seal with oaths fair God
I swear said Hermes by my serpent rod
And by thine eyes and by thy starry crown 
Light flew his earnest words among the blossoms blown
Then thus again the brilliance feminine
Too frail of heart for this lost nymph of thine
Free as the air invisibly she strays
About these thornless wilds her pleasant days
She tastes unseen unseen her nimble feet
Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet
From weary tendrils and bow'd branches green
She plucks the fruit unseen she bathes unseen
And by my power is her beauty veil'd 
To keep it unaffronted unassail'd
By the love-glances of unlovely eyes
Of Satyrs Fauns and blear'd Silenus' sighs
Pale grew her immortality for woe
Of all these lovers and she grieved so
I took compassion on her bade her steep
Her hair in weird syrops that would keep
Her loveliness invisible yet free
To wander as she loves in liberty
Thou shalt behold her Hermes thou alone 
If thou wilt as thou swearest grant my boon
Then once again the charmed God began
An oath and through the serpent ears it ran
Warm tremulous devout psalterian
Ravish'd she lifted her Circean head
Blush'd a live damask and swift-lisping said
I was a woman let me have once more
A woman shape and charming as before
I love a youth of Corinth O the bliss
Give me my woman form and place me where he is 
Stoop Hermes let me breathe upon thy brow
And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now
The God on half-shut feathers sank serene
She breath'd upon his eyes and swift was seen
Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green
It was no dream or say a dream it was
Real are the dreams of Gods and smoothly pass
Their pleasures in a long immortal dream
One warm flush'd moment hovering it might seem
Dash'd by the wood-nymph beauty so he burn'd 
Then lighting on the printless verdure turn'd
To the swoon'd serpent and with languid arm
Delicate put to proof the lythe Caducean charm
So done upon the nymph his eyes he bent
Full of adoring tears and blandishment
And towards her stept she like a moon in wane
Faded before him cower'd nor could restrain
Her fearful sobs self-folding like a flower
That faints into itself at evening hour
But the God fostering her chilled hand 
She felt the warmth her eyelids open'd bland
And like new flowers at morning song of bees
Bloom'd and gave up her honey to the lees
Into the green-recessed woods they flew
Nor grew they pale as mortal lovers do
Left to herself the serpent now began
To change her elfin blood in madness ran
Her mouth foam'd and the grass therewith besprent
Wither'd at dew so sweet and virulent
Her eyes in torture fix'd and anguish drear 
Hot glaz'd and wide with lid-lashes all sear
Flash'd phosphor and sharp sparks without one cooling tear
The colours all inflam'd throughout her train
She writh'd about convuls'd with scarlet pain
A deep volcanian yellow took the place
Of all her milder-mooned body grace
And as the lava ravishes the mead
Spoilt all her silver mail and golden brede
Made gloom of all her frecklings streaks and bars
Eclips'd her crescents and lick'd up her stars 
So that in moments few she was undrest
Of all her sapphires greens and amethyst
And rubious-argent of all these bereft
Nothing but pain and ugliness were left
Still shone her crown that vanish'd also she
Melted and disappear'd as suddenly
And in the air her new voice luting soft
Cried Lycius gentle Lycius Borne aloft
With the bright mists about the mountains hoar
These words dissolv'd Crete forests heard no more 
Whither fled Lamia now a lady bright
A full-born beauty new and exquisite
She fled into that valley they pass o'er
Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas' shore
And rested at the foot of those wild hills
The rugged founts of the Peraean rills
And of that other ridge whose barren back
Stretches with all its mist and cloudy rack
South-westward to Cleone There she stood
About a young bird flutter from a wood 
Fair on a sloping green of mossy tread
By a clear pool wherein she passioned
To see herself escap'd from so sore ills
While her robes flaunted with the daffodils
Ah happy Lycius for she was a maid
More beautiful than ever twisted braid
Or sigh'd or blush'd or on spring-flowered lea
Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy
A virgin purest lipp'd yet in the lore
Of love deep learned to the red heart core 
Not one hour old yet of sciential brain
To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain
Define their pettish limits and estrange
Their points of contact and swift counterchange
Intrigue with the specious chaos and dispart
Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art
As though in Cupid college she had spent
Sweet days a lovely graduate still unshent
And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment
Why this fair creature chose so fairily 
By the wayside to linger we shall see
But first 'tis fit to tell how she could muse
And dream when in the serpent prison-house
Of all she list strange or magnificent
How ever where she will'd her spirit went
Whether to faint Elysium or where
Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair
Wind into Thetis' bower by many a pearly stair
Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine
Stretch'd out at ease beneath a glutinous pine 
Or where in Pluto gardens palatine
Mulciber columns gleam in far piazzian line
And sometimes into cities she would send
Her dream with feast and rioting to blend
And once while among mortals dreaming thus
She saw the young Corinthian Lycius
Charioting foremost in the envious race
Like a young Jove with calm uneager face
And fell into a swooning love of him
Now on the moth-time of that evening dim 
He would return that way as well she knew
To Corinth from the shore for freshly blew
The eastern soft wind and his galley now
Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow
In port Cenchreas from Egina isle
Fresh anchor'd whither he had been awhile
To sacrifice to Jove whose temple there
Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense rare
Jove heard his vows and better'd his desire
For by some freakful chance he made retire 
From his companions and set forth to walk
Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk
Over the solitary hills he fared
Thoughtless at first but ere eve star appeared
His phantasy was lost where reason fades
In the calm'd twilight of Platonic shades
Lamia beheld him coming near more near 
Close to her passing in indifference drear
His silent sandals swept the mossy green
So neighbour'd to him and yet so unseen 
She stood he pass'd shut up in mysteries
His mind wrapp'd like his mantle while her eyes
Follow'd his steps and her neck regal white
Turn'd syllabling thus Ah Lycius bright
And will you leave me on the hills alone
Lycius look back and be some pity shown
He did not with cold wonder fearingly
But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice
For so delicious were the words she sung
It seem'd he had lov'd them a whole summer long 
And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up
Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup
And still the cup was full while he afraid
Lest she should vanish ere his lip had paid
Due adoration thus began to adore
Her soft look growing coy she saw his chain so sure
Leave thee alone Look back Ah Goddess see
Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee
For pity do not this sad heart belie 
Even as thou vanishest so I shall die 
Stay though a Naiad of the rivers stay
To thy far wishes will thy streams obey
Stay though the greenest woods be thy domain
Alone they can drink up the morning rain
Though a descended Pleiad will not one
Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune
Thy spheres and as thy silver proxy shine
So sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine
Came thy sweet greeting that if thou shouldst fade
Thy memory will waste me to a shade  
For pity do not melt If I should stay
Said Lamia here upon this floor of clay
And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough
What canst thou say or do of charm enough
To dull the nice remembrance of my home
Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam
Over these hills and vales where no joy is 
Empty of immortality and bliss
Thou art a scholar Lycius and must know
That finer spirits cannot breathe below 
In human climes and live Alas poor youth
What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe
My essence What serener palaces
Where I may all my many senses please
And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease
It cannot be Adieu So said she rose
Tiptoe with white arms spread He sick to lose
The amorous promise of her lone complain
Swoon'd murmuring of love and pale with pain
The cruel lady without any show 
Of sorrow for her tender favourite woe
But rather if her eyes could brighter be
With brighter eyes and slow amenity
Put her new lips to his and gave afresh
The life she had so tangled in her mesh
And as he from one trance was wakening
Into another she began to sing
Happy in beauty life and love and every thing
A song of love too sweet for earthly lyres
While like held breath the stars drew in their panting fires 
And then she whisper'd in such trembling tone
As those who safe together met alone
For the first time through many anguish'd days
Use other speech than looks bidding him raise
His drooping head and clear his soul of doubt
For that she was a woman and without
Any more subtle fluid in her veins
Than throbbing blood and that the self-same pains
Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his
And next she wonder'd how his eyes could miss 
Her face so long in Corinth where she said
She dwelt but half retir'd and there had led
Days happy as the gold coin could invent
Without the aid of love yet in content
Till she saw him as once she pass'd him by
Where 'gainst a column he leant thoughtfully
At Venus' temple porch 'mid baskets heap'd
Of amorous herbs and flowers newly reap'd
Late on that eve as 'twas the night before
The Adonian feast whereof she saw no more 
But wept alone those days for why should she adore
Lycius from death awoke into amaze
To see her still and singing so sweet lays
Then from amaze into delight he fell
To hear her whisper woman lore so well
And every word she spake entic'd him on
To unperplex'd delight and pleasure known
Let the mad poets say whate'er they please
Of the sweets of Fairies Peris Goddesses
There is not such a treat among them all 
Haunters of cavern lake and waterfall
As a real woman lineal indeed
From Pyrrha pebbles or old Adam seed
Thus gentle Lamia judg'd and judg'd aright
That Lycius could not love in half a fright
So threw the goddess off and won his heart
More pleasantly by playing woman part
With no more awe than what her beauty gave
That while it smote still guaranteed to save
Lycius to all made eloquent reply 
Marrying to every word a twinborn sigh
And last pointing to Corinth ask'd her sweet
If 'twas too far that night for her soft feet
The way was short for Lamia eagerness
Made by a spell the triple league decrease
To a few paces not at all surmised
By blinded Lycius so in her comprized
They pass'd the city gates he knew not how
So noiseless and he never thought to know
As men talk in a dream so Corinth all 
Throughout her palaces imperial
And all her populous streets and temples lewd
Mutter'd like tempest in the distance brew'd
To the wide-spreaded night above her towers
Men women rich and poor in the cool hours
Shuffled their sandals o'er the pavement white
Companion'd or alone while many a light
Flared here and there from wealthy festivals
And threw their moving shadows on the walls
Or found them cluster'd in the corniced shade 
Of some arch'd temple door or dusky colonnade
Muffling his face of greeting friends in fear
Her fingers he press'd hard as one came near
With curl'd gray beard sharp eyes and smooth bald crown
Slow-stepp'd and robed in philosophic gown
Lycius shrank closer as they met and past
Into his mantle adding wings to haste
While hurried Lamia trembled Ah said he
Why do you shudder love so ruefully
Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew  
I'm wearied said fair Lamia tell me who
Is that old man I cannot bring to mind
His features Lycius wherefore did you blind
Yourself from his quick eyes Lycius replied
'Tis Apollonius sage my trusty guide
And good instructor but to-night he seems
The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams
While yet he spake they had arrived before
A pillar'd porch with lofty portal door
Where hung a silver lamp whose phosphor glow 
Reflected in the slabbed steps below
Mild as a star in water for so new
And so unsullied was the marble hue
So through the crystal polish liquid fine
Ran the dark veins that none but feet divine
Could e'er have touch'd there Sounds AEolian
Breath'd from the hinges as the ample span
Of the wide doors disclos'd a place unknown
Some time to any but those two alone
And a few Persian mutes who that same year 
Were seen about the markets none knew where
They could inhabit the most curious
Were foil'd who watch'd to trace them to their house
And but the flitter-winged verse must tell
For truth sake what woe afterwards befel
'Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus
Shut from the busy world of more incredulous
Love in a hut with water and a crust
Is Love forgive us cinders ashes dust
Love in a palace is perhaps at last
More grievous torment than a hermit fast 
That is a doubtful tale from faery land
Hard for the non-elect to understand
Had Lycius liv'd to hand his story down
He might have given the moral a fresh frown
Or clench'd it quite but too short was their bliss
To breed distrust and hate that make the soft voice hiss 
Besides there nightly with terrific glare
Love jealous grown of so complete a pair
Hover'd and buzz'd his wings with fearful roar
Above the lintel of their chamber door
And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor
For all this came a ruin side by side
They were enthroned in the even tide
Upon a couch near to a curtaining
Whose airy texture from a golden string
Floated into the room and let appear 
Unveil'd the summer heaven blue and clear
Betwixt two marble shafts there they reposed
Where use had made it sweet with eyelids closed
Saving a tythe which love still open kept
That they might see each other while they almost slept
When from the slope side of a suburb hill
Deafening the swallow twitter came a thrill
Of trumpets Lycius started the sounds fled
But left a thought a buzzing in his head
For the first time since first he harbour'd in 
That purple-lined palace of sweet sin
His spirit pass'd beyond its golden bourn
Into the noisy world almost forsworn
The lady ever watchful penetrant
Saw this with pain so arguing a want
Of something more more than her empery
Of joys and she began to moan and sigh
Because he mused beyond her knowing well
That but a moment thought is passion passing bell
Why do you sigh fair creature whisper'd he 
Why do you think return'd she tenderly
You have deserted me where am I now
Not in your heart while care weighs on your brow
No no you have dismiss'd me and I go
From your breast houseless ay it must be so
He answer'd bending to her open eyes
Where he was mirror'd small in paradise
My silver planet both of eve and morn
Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn
While I am striving how to fill my heart 
With deeper crimson and a double smart
How to entangle trammel up and snare
Your soul in mine and labyrinth you there
Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose
Ay a sweet kiss you see your mighty woes
My thoughts shall I unveil them Listen then
What mortal hath a prize that other men
May be confounded and abash'd withal
But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical
And triumph as in thee I should rejoice 
Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth voice
Let my foes choke and my friends shout afar
While through the thronged streets your bridal car
Wheels round its dazzling spokes The lady cheek
Trembled she nothing said but pale and meek
Arose and knelt before him wept a rain
Of sorrows at his words at last with pain
Beseeching him the while his hand she wrung
To change his purpose He thereat was stung
Perverse with stronger fancy to reclaim 
Her wild and timid nature to his aim
Besides for all his love in self despite
Against his better self he took delight
Luxurious in her sorrows soft and new
His passion cruel grown took on a hue
Fierce and sanguineous as 'twas possible
In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell
Fine was the mitigated fury like
Apollo presence when in act to strike
The serpent Ha the serpent certes she 
Was none She burnt she lov'd the tyranny
And all subdued consented to the hour
When to the bridal he should lead his paramour
Whispering in midnight silence said the youth
Sure some sweet name thou hast though by my truth
I have not ask'd it ever thinking thee
Not mortal but of heavenly progeny
As still I do Hast any mortal name
Fit appellation for this dazzling frame
Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth 
To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth
I have no friends said Lamia no not one
My presence in wide Corinth hardly known
My parents' bones are in their dusty urns
Sepulchred where no kindled incense burns
Seeing all their luckless race are dead save me
And I neglect the holy rite for thee
Even as you list invite your many guests
But if as now it seems your vision rests
With any pleasure on me do not bid 
Old Apollonius from him keep me hid
Lycius perplex'd at words so blind and blank
Made close inquiry from whose touch she shrank
Feigning a sleep and he to the dull shade
Of deep sleep in a moment was betray'd
It was the custom then to bring away
The bride from home at blushing shut of day
Veil'd in a chariot heralded along
By strewn flowers torches and a marriage song
With other pageants but this fair unknown 
Had not a friend So being left alone
Lycius was gone to summon all his kin
And knowing surely she could never win
His foolish heart from its mad pompousness
She set herself high-thoughted how to dress
The misery in fit magnificence
She did so but 'tis doubtful how and whence
Came and who were her subtle servitors
About the halls and to and from the doors
There was a noise of wings till in short space 
The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched grace
A haunting music sole perhaps and lone
Supportress of the faery-roof made moan
Throughout as fearful the whole charm might fade
Fresh carved cedar mimicking a glade
Of palm and plantain met from either side
High in the midst in honour of the bride
Two palms and then two plantains and so on
From either side their stems branch'd one to one
All down the aisled place and beneath all 
There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall
So canopied lay an untasted feast
Teeming with odours Lamia regal drest
Silently paced about and as she went
In pale contented sort of discontent
Mission'd her viewless servants to enrich
The fretted splendour of each nook and niche
Between the tree-stems marbled plain at first
Came jasper pannels then anon there burst
Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees 
And with the larger wove in small intricacies
Approving all she faded at self-will
And shut the chamber up close hush'd and still
Complete and ready for the revels rude
When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude
The day appear'd and all the gossip rout
O senseless Lycius Madman wherefore flout
The silent-blessing fate warm cloister'd hours
And show to common eyes these secret bowers
The herd approach'd each guest with busy brain 
Arriving at the portal gaz'd amain
And enter'd marveling for they knew the street
Remember'd it from childhood all complete
Without a gap yet ne'er before had seen
That royal porch that high-built fair demesne
So in they hurried all maz'd curious and keen
Save one who look'd thereon with eye severe
And with calm-planted steps walk'd in austere
'Twas Apollonius something too he laugh'd
As though some knotty problem that had daft 
His patient thought had now begun to thaw
And solve and melt 'twas just as he foresaw
He met within the murmurous vestibule
His young disciple 'Tis no common rule
Lycius said he for uninvited guest
To force himself upon you and infest
With an unbidden presence the bright throng
Of younger friends yet must I do this wrong
And you forgive me Lycius blush'd and led
The old man through the inner doors broad-spread 
With reconciling words and courteous mien
Turning into sweet milk the sophist spleen
Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room
Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume
Before each lucid pannel fuming stood
A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood
Each by a sacred tripod held aloft
Whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft
Wool-woofed carpets fifty wreaths of smoke
From fifty censers their light voyage took 
To the high roof still mimick'd as they rose
Along the mirror'd walls by twin-clouds odorous
Twelve sphered tables by silk seats insphered
High as the level of a man breast rear'd
On libbard paws upheld the heavy gold
Of cups and goblets and the store thrice told
Of Ceres' horn and in huge vessels wine
Come from the gloomy tun with merry shine
Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood
Each shrining in the midst the image of a God 
When in an antichamber every guest
Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press'd
By minist'ring slaves upon his hands and feet
And fragrant oils with ceremony meet
Pour'd on his hair they all mov'd to the feast
In white robes and themselves in order placed
Around the silken couches wondering
Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring
Soft went the music the soft air along
While fluent Greek a vowel'd undersong 
Kept up among the guests discoursing low
At first for scarcely was the wine at flow
But when the happy vintage touch'd their brains
Louder they talk and louder come the strains
Of powerful instruments the gorgeous dyes
The space the splendour of the draperies
The roof of awful richness nectarous cheer
Beautiful slaves and Lamia self appear
Now when the wine has done its rosy deed
And every soul from human trammels freed 
No more so strange for merry wine sweet wine
Will make Elysian shades not too fair too divine
Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height
Flush'd were their cheeks and bright eyes double bright
Garlands of every green and every scent
From vales deflower'd or forest-trees branch-rent
In baskets of bright osier'd gold were brought
High as the handles heap'd to suit the thought
Of every guest that each as he did please
Might fancy-fit his brows silk-pillow'd at his ease 
What wreath for Lamia What for Lycius
What for the sage old Apollonius
Upon her aching forehead be there hung
The leaves of willow and of adder tongue
And for the youth quick let us strip for him
The thyrsus that his watching eyes may swim
Into forgetfulness and for the sage
Let spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage
War on his temples Do not all charms fly
At the mere touch of cold philosophy 
There was an awful rainbow once in heaven
We know her woof her texture she is given
In the dull catalogue of common things
Philosophy will clip an Angel wings
Conquer all mysteries by rule and line
Empty the haunted air and gnomed mine 
Unweave a rainbow as it erewhile made
The tender-person'd Lamia melt into a shade
By her glad Lycius sitting in chief place
Scarce saw in all the room another face 
Till checking his love trance a cup he took
Full brimm'd and opposite sent forth a look
'Cross the broad table to beseech a glance
From his old teacher wrinkled countenance
And pledge him The bald-head philosopher
Had fix'd his eye without a twinkle or stir
Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride
Brow-beating her fair form and troubling her sweet pride
Lycius then press'd her hand with devout touch
As pale it lay upon the rosy couch 
'Twas icy and the cold ran through his veins
Then sudden it grew hot and all the pains
Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart
Lamia what means this Wherefore dost thou start
Know'st thou that man Poor Lamia answer'd not
He gaz'd into her eyes and not a jot
Own'd they the lovelorn piteous appeal
More more he gaz'd his human senses reel
Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs
There was no recognition in those orbs 
Lamia he cried and no soft-toned reply
The many heard and the loud revelry
Grew hush the stately music no more breathes
The myrtle sicken'd in a thousand wreaths
By faint degrees voice lute and pleasure ceased
A deadly silence step by step increased
Until it seem'd a horrid presence there
And not a man but felt the terror in his hair
Lamia he shriek'd and nothing but the shriek
With its sad echo did the silence break 
Begone foul dream he cried gazing again
In the bride face where now no azure vein
Wander'd on fair-spaced temples no soft bloom
Misted the cheek no passion to illume
The deep-recessed vision all was blight
Lamia no longer fair there sat a deadly white
Shut shut those juggling eyes thou ruthless man
Turn them aside wretch or the righteous ban
Of all the Gods whose dreadful images
Here represent their shadowy presences 
May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn
Of painful blindness leaving thee forlorn
In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright
Of conscience for their long offended might
For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries
Unlawful magic and enticing lies
Corinthians look upon that gray-beard wretch
Mark how possess'd his lashless eyelids stretch
Around his demon eyes Corinthians see
My sweet bride withers at their potency 
Fool said the sophist in an under-tone
Gruff with contempt which a death-nighing moan
From Lycius answer'd as heart-struck and lost
He sank supine beside the aching ghost
Fool Fool repeated he while his eyes still
Relented not nor mov'd from every ill
Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day
And shall I see thee made a serpent prey
Then Lamia breath'd death breath the sophist eye
Like a sharp spear went through her utterly 
Keen cruel perceant stinging she as well
As her weak hand could any meaning tell
Motion'd him to be silent vainly so
He look'd and look'd again a level No
A Serpent echoed he no sooner said
Than with a frightful scream she vanished
And Lycius' arms were empty of delight
As were his limbs of life from that same night
On the high couch he lay his friends came round 
Supported him no pulse or breath they found 
And in its marriage robe the heavy body woundA
Deep in the shady sadness of a vale
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn
Far from the fiery noon and eve one star
Sat gray-hair'd Saturn quiet as a stone
Still as the silence round about his lair
Forest on forest hung about his head
Like cloud on cloud No stir of air was there
Not so much life as on a summer day
Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass
But where the dead leaf fell there did it rest 
A stream went voiceless by still deadened more
By reason of his fallen divinity
Spreading a shade the Naiad 'mid her reeds
Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips
Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went
No further than to where his feet had stray'd
And slept there since Upon the sodden ground
His old right hand lay nerveless listless dead
Unsceptred and his realmless eyes were closed
While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth 
His ancient mother for some comfort yet
It seem'd no force could wake him from his place
But there came one who with a kindred hand
Touch'd his wide shoulders after bending low
With reverence though to one who knew it not
She was a Goddess of the infant world
By her in stature the tall Amazon
Had stood a pigmy height she would have ta'en
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck
Or with a finger stay'd Ixion wheel 
Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx
Pedestal'd haply in a palace court
When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore
But oh how unlike marble was that face
How beautiful if sorrow had not made
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty self
There was a listening fear in her regard
As if calamity had but begun
As if the vanward clouds of evil days
Had spent their malice and the sullen rear 
Was with its stored thunder labouring up
One hand she press'd upon that aching spot
Where beats the human heart as if just there
Though an immortal she felt cruel pain
The other upon Saturn bended neck
She laid and to the level of his ear
Leaning with parted lips some words she spake
In solemn tenour and deep organ tone
Some mourning words which in our feeble tongue
Would come in these like accents O how frail 
To that large utterance of the early Gods
Saturn look up though wherefore poor old King
I have no comfort for thee no not one
I cannot say 'O wherefore sleepest thou
For heaven is parted from thee and the earth
Knows thee not thus afflicted for a God
And ocean too with all its solemn noise
Has from thy sceptre pass'd and all the air
Is emptied of thine hoary majesty
Thy thunder conscious of the new command 
Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house
And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands
Scorches and burns our once serene domain
O aching time O moments big as years
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth
And press it so upon our weary griefs
That unbelief has not a space to breathe
Saturn sleep on O thoughtless why did I
Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes 
Saturn sleep on while at thy feet I weep
As when upon a tranced summer-night
Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods
Tall oaks branch-charmed by the earnest stars
Dream and so dream all night without a stir
Save from one gradual solitary gust
Which comes upon the silence and dies off
As if the ebbing air had but one wave
So came these words and went the while in tears
She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground 
Just where her falling hair might be outspread
A soft and silken mat for Saturn feet
One moon with alteration slow had shed
Her silver seasons four upon the night
And still these two were postured motionless
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern
The frozen God still couchant on the earth
And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet
Until at length old Saturn lifted up
His faded eyes and saw his kingdom gone 
And all the gloom and sorrow of the place
And that fair kneeling Goddess and then spake
As with a palsied tongue and while his beard
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady
O tender spouse of gold Hyperion
Thea I feel thee ere I see thy face
Look up and let me see our doom in it
Look up and tell me if this feeble shape
Is Saturn tell me if thou hear'st the voice
Of Saturn tell me if this wrinkling brow 
Naked and bare of its great diadem
Peers like the front of Saturn Who had power
To make me desolate whence came the strength
How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth
While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp
But it is so and I am smother'd up
And buried from all godlike exercise
Of influence benign on planets pale
Of admonitions to the winds and seas
Of peaceful sway above man harvesting 
And all those acts which Deity supreme
Doth ease its heart of love in I am gone
Away from my own bosom I have left
My strong identity my real self
Somewhere between the throne and where I sit
Here on this spot of earth Search Thea search
Open thine eyes eterne and sphere them round
Upon all space space starr'd and lorn of light
Space region'd with life-air and barren void
Spaces of fire and all the yawn of hell  
Search Thea search and tell me if thou seest
A certain shape or shadow making way
With wings or chariot fierce to repossess
A heaven he lost erewhile it must it must
Be of ripe progress Saturn must be King
Yes there must be a golden victory
There must be Gods thrown down and trumpets blown
Of triumph calm and hymns of festival
Upon the gold clouds metropolitan
Voices of soft proclaim and silver stir 
Of strings in hollow shells and there shall be
Beautiful things made new for the surprise
Of the sky-children I will give command
Thea Thea Thea where is Saturn
This passion lifted him upon his feet
And made his hands to struggle in the air
His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat
His eyes to fever out his voice to cease
He stood and heard not Thea sobbing deep
A little time and then again he snatch'd 
Utterance thus But cannot I create
Cannot I form Cannot I fashion forth
Another world another universe
To overbear and crumble this to nought
Where is another chaos Where That word
Found way unto Olympus and made quake
The rebel three Thea was startled up
And in her bearing was a sort of hope
As thus she quick-voic'd spake yet full of awe
This cheers our fallen house come to our friends 
O Saturn come away and give them heart
I know the covert for thence came I hither
Thus brief then with beseeching eyes she went
With backward footing through the shade a space
He follow'd and she turn'd to lead the way
Through aged boughs that yielded like the mist
Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest
Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed
More sorrow like to this and such like woe
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe 
The Titans fierce self-hid or prison-bound
Groan'd for the old allegiance once more
And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn voice
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept
His sov'reignty and rule and majesty 
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire
Still sat still snuff'd the incense teeming up
From man to the sun God yet unsecure
For as among us mortals omens drear
Fright and perplex so also shuddered he  
Not at dog howl or gloom-bird hated screech
Or the familiar visiting of one
Upon the first toll of his passing-bell
Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp
But horrors portion'd to a giant nerve
Oft made Hyperion ache His palace bright
Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold
And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks
Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts
Arches and domes and fiery galleries 
And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds
Flush'd angerly while sometimes eagle wings
Unseen before by Gods or wondering men
Darken'd the place and neighing steeds were heard
Not heard before by Gods or wondering men
Also when he would taste the spicy wreaths
Of incense breath'd aloft from sacred hills
Instead of sweets his ample palate took
Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick
And so when harbour'd in the sleepy west 
After the full completion of fair day 
For rest divine upon exalted couch
And slumber in the arms of melody
He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease
With stride colossal on from hall to hall
While far within each aisle and deep recess
His winged minions in close clusters stood
Amaz'd and full of fear like anxious men
Who on wide plains gather in panting troops
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers 
Even now while Saturn rous'd from icy trance
Went step for step with Thea through the woods
Hyperion leaving twilight in the rear
Came slope upon the threshold of the west
Then as was wont his palace-door flew ope
In smoothest silence save what solemn tubes
Blown by the serious Zephyrs gave of sweet
And wandering sounds slow-breathed melodies
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape
In fragrance soft and coolness to the eye 
That inlet to severe magnificence
Stood full blown for the God to enter in
He enter'd but he enter'd full of wrath
His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels
And gave a roar as if of earthly fire
That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours
And made their dove-wings tremble On he flared
From stately nave to nave from vault to vault
Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light
And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades 
Until he reach'd the great main cupola
There standing fierce beneath he stampt his foot
And from the basements deep to the high towers
Jarr'd his own golden region and before
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd
His voice leapt out despite of godlike curb
To this result O dreams of day and night
O monstrous forms O effigies of pain
O spectres busy in a cold cold gloom
O lank-eared Phantoms of black-weeded pools 
Why do I know ye why have I seen ye why
Is my eternal essence thus distraught
To see and to behold these horrors new
Saturn is fallen am I too to fall
Am I to leave this haven of my rest
This cradle of my glory this soft clime
This calm luxuriance of blissful light
These crystalline pavilions and pure fanes
Of all my lucent empire It is left
Deserted void nor any haunt of mine 
The blaze the splendor and the symmetry
I cannot see but darkness death and darkness
Even here into my centre of repose
The shady visions come to domineer
Insult and blind and stifle up my pomp 
Fall No by Tellus and her briny robes
Over the fiery frontier of my realms
I will advance a terrible right arm
Shall scare that infant thunderer rebel Jove
And bid old Saturn take his throne again  
He spake and ceas'd the while a heavier threat
Held struggle with his throat but came not forth
For as in theatres of crowded men
Hubbub increases more they call out Hush
So at Hyperion words the Phantoms pale
Bestirr'd themselves thrice horrible and cold
And from the mirror'd level where he stood
A mist arose as from a scummy marsh
At this through all his bulk an agony
Crept gradual from the feet unto the crown 
Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular
Making slow way with head and neck convuls'd
From over-strained might Releas'd he fled
To the eastern gates and full six dewy hours
Before the dawn in season due should blush
He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals
Clear'd them of heavy vapours burst them wide
Suddenly on the ocean chilly streams
The planet orb of fire whereon he rode
Each day from east to west the heavens through 
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds
Not therefore veiled quite blindfold and hid
But ever and anon the glancing spheres
Circles and arcs and broad-belting colure
Glow'd through and wrought upon the muffling dark
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep
Up to the zenith hieroglyphics old
Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers
Then living on the earth with labouring thought
Won from the gaze of many centuries 
Now lost save what we find on remnants huge
Of stone or marble swart their import gone
Their wisdom long since fled Two wings this orb
Possess'd for glory two fair argent wings
Ever exalted at the God approach
And now from forth the gloom their plumes immense
Rose one by one till all outspreaded were
While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse
Awaiting for Hyperion command
Fain would he have commanded fain took throne 
And bid the day begin if but for change
He might not No though a primeval God
The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd
Therefore the operations of the dawn
Stay'd in their birth even as here 'tis told
Those silver wings expanded sisterly
Eager to sail their orb the porches wide
Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night
And the bright Titan phrenzied with new woes
Unus'd to bend by hard compulsion bent 
His spirit to the sorrow of the time
And all along a dismal rack of clouds
Upon the boundaries of day and night
He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint
There as he lay the Heaven with its stars
Look'd down on him with pity and the voice
Of Coelus from the universal space
Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear
O brightest of my children dear earth-born
And sky-engendered Son of Mysteries 
All unrevealed even to the powers
Which met at thy creating at whose joys
And palpitations sweet and pleasures soft
I Coelus wonder how they came and whence
And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be
Distinct and visible symbols divine
Manifestations of that beauteous life
Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space
Of these new-form'd art thou oh brightest child
Of these thy brethren and the Goddesses 
There is sad feud among ye and rebellion
Of son against his sire I saw him fall
I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne
To me his arms were spread to me his voice
Found way from forth the thunders round his head
Pale wox I and in vapours hid my face
Art thou too near such doom vague fear there is
For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods
Divine ye were created and divine
In sad demeanour solemn undisturb'd 
Unruffled like high Gods ye liv'd and ruled
Now I behold in you fear hope and wrath
Actions of rage and passion even as
I see them on the mortal world beneath
In men who die This is the grief O Son
Sad sign of ruin sudden dismay and fall
Yet do thou strive as thou art capable
As thou canst move about an evident God
And canst oppose to each malignant hour
Ethereal presence I am but a voice 
My life is but the life of winds and tides
No more than winds and tides can I avail 
But thou canst Be thou therefore in the van
Of circumstance yea seize the arrow barb
Before the tense string murmur To the earth
For there thou wilt find Saturn and his woes
Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun
And of thy seasons be a careful nurse 
Ere half this region-whisper had come down
Hyperion arose and on the stars 
Lifted his curved lids and kept them wide
Until it ceas'd and still he kept them wide
And still they were the same bright patient stars
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast
Like to a diver in the pearly seas
Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore
And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night
Just at the self-same beat of Time wide wings
Hyperion slid into the rustled air
And Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place
Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd
It was a den where no insulting light
Could glimmer on their tears where their own groans
They felt but heard not for the solid roar
Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse
Pouring a constant bulk uncertain where
Crag jutting forth to crag and rocks that seem'd 
Ever as if just rising from a sleep
Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns
And thus in thousand hugest phantasies
Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe
Instead of thrones hard flint they sat upon
Couches of rugged stone and slaty ridge
Stubborn'd with iron All were not assembled
Some chain'd in torture and some wandering
Coeus and Gyges and Briareus
Typhon and Dolor and Porphyrion 
With many more the brawniest in assault
Were pent in regions of laborious breath
Dungeon'd in opaque element to keep
Their clenched teeth still clench'd and all their limbs
Lock'd up like veins of metal crampt and screw'd
Without a motion save of their big hearts
Heaving in pain and horribly convuls'd
With sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse
Mnemosyne was straying in the world
Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered 
And many else were free to roam abroad
But for the main here found they covert drear
Scarce images of life one here one there
Lay vast and edgeways like a dismal cirque
Of Druid stones upon a forlorn moor
When the chill rain begins at shut of eve
In dull November and their chancel vault
The Heaven itself is blinded throughout night
Each one kept shroud nor to his neighbour gave
Or word or look or action of despair 
Creus was one his ponderous iron mace
Lay by him and a shatter'd rib of rock
Told of his rage ere he thus sank and pined
Iapetus another in his grasp
A serpent plashy neck its barbed tongue
Squeez'd from the gorge and all its uncurl'd length
Dead and because the creature could not spit
Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove
Next Cottus prone he lay chin uppermost
As though in pain for still upon the flint 
He ground severe his skull with open mouth
And eyes at horrid working Nearest him
Asia born of most enormous Caf
Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs
Though feminine than any of her sons
More thought than woe was in her dusky face
For she was prophesying of her glory
And in her wide imagination stood
Palm-shaded temples and high rival fanes
By Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles 
Even as Hope upon her anchor leans
So leant she not so fair upon a tusk
Shed from the broadest of her elephants
Above her on a crag uneasy shelve
Upon his elbow rais'd all prostrate else
Shadow'd Enceladus once tame and mild
As grazing ox unworried in the meads
Now tiger-passion'd lion-thoughted wroth
He meditated plotted and even now
Was hurling mountains in that second war 
Not long delay'd that scar'd the younger Gods
To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird
Not far hence Atlas and beside him prone
Phorcus the sire of Gorgons Neighbour'd close
Oceanus and Tethys in whose lap
Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair
In midst of all lay Themis at the feet
Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight
No shape distinguishable more than when
Thick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds 
And many else whose names may not be told
For when the Muse wings are air-ward spread
Who shall delay her flight And she must chaunt
Of Saturn and his guide who now had climb'd
With damp and slippery footing from a depth
More horrid still Above a sombre cliff
Their heads appear'd and up their stature grew
Till on the level height their steps found ease
Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms
Upon the precincts of this nest of pain 
And sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn face
There saw she direst strife the supreme God
At war with all the frailty of grief
Of rage of fear anxiety revenge
Remorse spleen hope but most of all despair
Against these plagues he strove in vain for Fate
Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head
A disanointing poison so that Thea
Affrighted kept her still and let him pass
First onwards in among the fallen tribe 
As with us mortal men the laden heart
Is persecuted more and fever'd more
When it is nighing to the mournful house
Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise
So Saturn as he walk'd into the midst
Felt faint and would have sunk among the rest
But that he met Enceladus eye
Whose mightiness and awe of him at once
Came like an inspiration and he shouted
Titans behold your God at which some groan'd 
Some started on their feet some also shouted
Some wept some wail'd all bow'd with reverence
And Ops uplifting her black folded veil
Show'd her pale cheeks and all her forehead wan
Her eye-brows thin and jet and hollow eyes
There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines
When Winter lifts his voice there is a noise
Among immortals when a God gives sign
With hushing finger how he means to load
His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought 
With thunder and with music and with pomp
Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines
Which when it ceases in this mountain'd world
No other sound succeeds but ceasing here
Among these fallen Saturn voice therefrom
Grew up like organ that begins anew
Its strain when other harmonies stopt short
Leave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly
Thus grew it up Not in my own sad breast
Which is its own great judge and searcher out 
Can I find reason why ye should be thus
Not in the legends of the first of days
Studied from that old spirit-leaved book
Which starry Uranus with finger bright
Sav'd from the shores of darkness when the waves
Low-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom 
And the which book ye know I ever kept
For my firm-based footstool Ah infirm
Not there nor in sign symbol or portent
Of element earth water air and fire  
At war at peace or inter-quarreling
One against one or two or three or all
Each several one against the other three
As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods
Drown both and press them both against earth face
Where finding sulphur a quadruple wrath
Unhinges the poor world not in that strife
Wherefrom I take strange lore and read it deep
Can I find reason why ye should be thus
No no-where can unriddle though I search 
And pore on Nature universal scroll
Even to swooning why ye Divinities
The first-born of all shap'd and palpable Gods
Should cower beneath what in comparison
Is untremendous might Yet ye are here
O'erwhelm'd and spurn'd and batter'd ye are here
O Titans shall I say 'Arise' Ye groan
Shall I say 'Crouch' Ye groan What can I then
O Heaven wide O unseen parent dear
What can I Tell me all ye brethren Gods 
How we can war how engine our great wrath
O speak your counsel now for Saturn ear
Is all a-hunger'd Thou Oceanus
Ponderest high and deep and in thy face
I see astonied that severe content
Which comes of thought and musing give us help
So ended Saturn and the God of the Sea
Sophist and sage from no Athenian grove
But cogitation in his watery shades
Arose with locks not oozy and began 
In murmurs which his first-endeavouring tongue
Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands
O ye whom wrath consumes who passion-stung
Writhe at defeat and nurse your agonies
Shut up your senses stifle up your ears
My voice is not a bellows unto ire
Yet listen ye who will whilst I bring proof
How ye perforce must be content to stoop
And in the proof much comfort will I give
If ye will take that comfort in its truth 
We fall by course of Nature law not force
Of thunder or of Jove Great Saturn thou
Hast sifted well the atom-universe
But for this reason that thou art the King
And only blind from sheer supremacy
One avenue was shaded from thine eyes
Through which I wandered to eternal truth
And first as thou wast not the first of powers
So art thou not the last it cannot be
Thou art not the beginning nor the end 
From chaos and parental darkness came
Light the first fruits of that intestine broil
That sullen ferment which for wondrous ends
Was ripening in itself The ripe hour came
And with it light and light engendering
Upon its own producer forthwith touch'd
The whole enormous matter into life
Upon that very hour our parentage
The Heavens and the Earth were manifest
Then thou first-born and we the giant-race 
Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms
Now comes the pain of truth to whom 'tis pain
O folly for to bear all naked truths
And to envisage circumstance all calm
That is the top of sovereignty Mark well
As Heaven and Earth are fairer fairer far
Than Chaos and blank Darkness though once chiefs
And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth
In form and shape compact and beautiful
In will in action free companionship 
And thousand other signs of purer life
So on our heels a fresh perfection treads
A power more strong in beauty born of us
And fated to excel us as we pass
In glory that old Darkness nor are we
Thereby more conquer'd than by us the rule
Of shapeless Chaos Say doth the dull soil
Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed
And feedeth still more comely than itself
Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves 
Or shall the tree be envious of the dove
Because it cooeth and hath snowy wings
To wander wherewithal and find its joys
We are such forest-trees and our fair boughs
Have bred forth not pale solitary doves
But eagles golden-feather'd who do tower
Above us in their beauty and must reign
In right thereof for 'tis the eternal law
That first in beauty should be first in might
Yea by that law another race may drive 
Our conquerors to mourn as we do now
Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas
My dispossessor Have ye seen his face
Have ye beheld his chariot foam'd along
By noble winged creatures he hath made
I saw him on the calmed waters scud
With such a glow of beauty in his eyes
That it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell
To all my empire farewell sad I took
And hither came to see how dolorous fate 
Had wrought upon ye and how I might best
Give consolation in this woe extreme
Receive the truth and let it be your balm
Whether through poz'd conviction or disdain
They guarded silence when Oceanus
Left murmuring what deepest thought can tell
But so it was none answer'd for a space
Save one whom none regarded Clymene
And yet she answer'd not only complain'd
With hectic lips and eyes up-looking mild 
Thus wording timidly among the fierce
O Father I am here the simplest voice
And all my knowledge is that joy is gone
And this thing woe crept in among our hearts
There to remain for ever as I fear
I would not bode of evil if I thought
So weak a creature could turn off the help
Which by just right should come of mighty Gods
Yet let me tell my sorrow let me tell
Of what I heard and how it made me weep 
And know that we had parted from all hope
I stood upon a shore a pleasant shore
Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land
Of fragrance quietness and trees and flowers
Full of calm joy it was as I of grief
Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth
So that I felt a movement in my heart
To chide and to reproach that solitude
With songs of misery music of our woes
And sat me down and took a mouthed shell 
And murmur'd into it and made melody 
O melody no more for while I sang
And with poor skill let pass into the breeze
The dull shell echo from a bowery strand
Just opposite an island of the sea
There came enchantment with the shifting wind
That did both drown and keep alive my ears
I threw my shell away upon the sand
And a wave fill'd it as my sense was fill'd
With that new blissful golden melody 
A living death was in each gush of sounds
Each family of rapturous hurried notes
That fell one after one yet all at once
Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string
And then another then another strain
Each like a dove leaving its olive perch
With music wing'd instead of silent plumes
To hover round my head and make me sick
Of joy and grief at once Grief overcame
And I was stopping up my frantic ears 
When past all hindrance of my trembling hands
A voice came sweeter sweeter than all tune
And still it cried 'Apollo young Apollo
The morning-bright Apollo young Apollo
I fled it follow'd me and cried 'Apollo
O Father and O Brethren had ye felt
Those pains of mine O Saturn hadst thou felt
Ye would not call this too indulged tongue
Presumptuous in thus venturing to be heard
So far her voice flow'd on like timorous brook 
That lingering along a pebbled coast
Doth fear to meet the sea but sea it met
And shudder'd for the overwhelming voice
Of huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath
The ponderous syllables like sullen waves
In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks
Came booming thus while still upon his arm
He lean'd not rising from supreme contempt
Or shall we listen to the over-wise
Or to the over-foolish Giant-Gods 
Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt till all
That rebel Jove whole armoury were spent
Not world on world upon these shoulders piled
Could agonize me more than baby-words
In midst of this dethronement horrible
Speak roar shout yell ye sleepy Titans all
Do ye forget the blows the buffets vile
Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm
Dost thou forget sham Monarch of the Waves
Thy scalding in the seas What have I rous'd 
Your spleens with so few simple words as these
O joy for now I see ye are not lost
O joy for now I see a thousand eyes
Wide glaring for revenge As this he said
He lifted up his stature vast and stood
Still without intermission speaking thus
Now ye are flames I'll tell you how to burn
And purge the ether of our enemies
How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire
And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove 
Stifling that puny essence in its tent
O let him feel the evil he hath done
For though I scorn Oceanus lore
Much pain have I for more than loss of realms
The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled
Those days all innocent of scathing war
When all the fair Existences of heaven
Came open-eyed to guess what we would speak 
That was before our brows were taught to frown
Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds 
That was before we knew the winged thing
Victory might be lost or might be won
And be ye mindful that Hyperion
Our brightest brother still is undisgraced 
Hyperion lo his radiance is here
All eyes were on Enceladus face
And they beheld while still Hyperion name
Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks
A pallid gleam across his features stern
Not savage for he saw full many a God 
Wroth as himself He look'd upon them all
And in each face he saw a gleam of light
But splendider in Saturn whose hoar locks
Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel
When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove
In pale and silver silence they remain'd
Till suddenly a splendour like the morn
Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps
All the sad spaces of oblivion
And every gulf and every chasm old 
And every height and every sullen depth
Voiceless or hoarse with loud tormented streams
And all the everlasting cataracts
And all the headlong torrents far and near
Mantled before in darkness and huge shade
Now saw the light and made it terrible
It was Hyperion a granite peak
His bright feet touch'd and there he stay'd to view
The misery his brilliance had betray'd
To the most hateful seeing of itself 
Golden his hair of short Numidian curl
Regal his shape majestic a vast shade
In midst of his own brightness like the bulk
Of Memnon image at the set of sun
To one who travels from the dusking East
Sighs too as mournful as that Memnon harp
He utter'd while his hands contemplative
He press'd together and in silence stood
Despondence seiz'd again the fallen Gods
At sight of the dejected King of Day 
And many hid their faces from the light
But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes
Among the brotherhood and at their glare
Uprose Iapetus and Creus too
And Phorcus sea-born and together strode
To where he towered on his eminence
There those four shouted forth old Saturn name
Hyperion from the peak loud answered Saturn
Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods
In whose face was no joy though all the Gods 
Gave from their hollow throats the name of Saturn
Thus in alternate uproar and sad peace
Amazed were those Titans utterly
O leave them Muse O leave them to their woes
For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire
A solitary sorrow best befits
Thy lips and antheming a lonely grief
Leave them O Muse for thou anon wilt find
Many a fallen old Divinity
Wandering in vain about bewildered shores
Meantime touch piously the Delphic harp 
And not a wind of heaven but will breathe
In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute
For lo 'tis for the Father of all verse
Flush every thing that hath a vermeil hue
Let the rose glow intense and warm the air
And let the clouds of even and of morn
Float in voluptuous fleeces o'er the hills
Let the red wine within the goblet boil
Cold as a bubbling well let faint-lipp'd shells
On sands or in great deeps vermilion turn 
Through all their labyrinths and let the maid
Blush keenly as with some warm kiss surpris'd
Chief isle of the embowered Cyclades
Rejoice O Delos with thine olives green
And poplars and lawn-shading palms and beech
In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song
And hazels thick dark-stemm'd beneath the shade
Apollo is once more the golden theme
Where was he when the Giant of the Sun
Stood bright amid the sorrow of his peers 
Together had he left his mother fair
And his twin-sister sleeping in their bower
And in the morning twilight wandered forth
Beside the osiers of a rivulet
Full ankle-deep in lilies of the vale
The nightingale had ceas'd and a few stars
Were lingering in the heavens while the thrush
Began calm-throated Throughout all the isle
There was no covert no retired cave
Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves 
Though scarcely heard in many a green recess
He listen'd and he wept and his bright tears
Went trickling down the golden bow he held
Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood
While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by
With solemn step an awful Goddess came
And there was purport in her looks for him
Which he with eager guess began to read
Perplex'd the while melodiously he said
How cam'st thou over the unfooted sea 
Or hath that antique mien and robed form
Mov'd in these vales invisible till now
Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o'er
The fallen leaves when I have sat alone
In cool mid-forest Surely I have traced
The rustle of those ample skirts about
These grassy solitudes and seen the flowers
Lift up their heads as still the whisper pass'd
Goddess I have beheld those eyes before
And their eternal calm and all that face 
Or I have dream'd Yes said the supreme shape
Thou hast dream'd of me and awaking up
Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side
Whose strings touch'd by thy fingers all the vast
Unwearied ear of the whole universe
Listen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth
Of such new tuneful wonder Is't not strange
That thou shouldst weep so gifted Tell me youth
What sorrow thou canst feel for I am sad
When thou dost shed a tear explain thy griefs 
To one who in this lonely isle hath been
The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life
From the young day when first thy infant hand
Pluck'd witless the weak flowers till thine arm
Could bend that bow heroic to all times
Show thy heart secret to an ancient Power
Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones
For prophecies of thee and for the sake
Of loveliness new born Apollo then
With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes 
Thus answer'd while his white melodious throat
Throbb'd with the syllables Mnemosyne
Thy name is on my tongue I know not how
Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest
Why should I strive to show what from thy lips
Would come no mystery For me dark dark
And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes
I strive to search wherefore I am so sad
Until a melancholy numbs my limbs
And then upon the grass I sit and moan 
Like one who once had wings O why should I
Feel curs'd and thwarted when the liegeless air
Yields to my step aspirant why should I
Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet
Goddess benign point forth some unknown thing
Are there not other regions than this isle
What are the stars There is the sun the sun
And the most patient brilliance of the moon
And stars by thousands Point me out the way
To any one particular beauteous star 
And I will flit into it with my lyre
And make its silvery splendour pant with bliss
I have heard the cloudy thunder Where is power
Whose hand whose essence what divinity
Makes this alarum in the elements
While I here idle listen on the shores
In fearless yet in aching ignorance
O tell me lonely Goddess by thy harp
That waileth every morn and eventide
Tell me why thus I rave about these groves 
Mute thou remainest Mute yet I can read
A wondrous lesson in thy silent face
Knowledge enormous makes a God of me
Names deeds gray legends dire events rebellions
Majesties sovran voices agonies
Creations and destroyings all at once
Pour into the wide hollows of my brain
And deify me as if some blithe wine
Or bright elixir peerless I had drunk
And so become immortal Thus the God 
While his enkindled eyes with level glance
Beneath his white soft temples stedfast kept
Trembling with light upon Mnemosyne
Soon wild commotions shook him and made flush
All the immortal fairness of his limbs
Most like the struggle at the gate of death
Or liker still to one who should take leave
Of pale immortal death and with a pang
As hot as death is chill with fierce convulse
Die into life so young Apollo anguish'd 
His very hair his golden tresses famed
Kept undulation round his eager neck
During the pain Mnemosyne upheld
Her arms as one who prophesied At length
Apollo shriek'd and lo from all his limbs
O happy Earth reality of Heaven
To which those restless powers that ceaselessly
Throng through the human universe aspire
Thou consummation of all mortal hope 
Thou glorious prize of blindly-working will
Whose rays diffused throughout all space and time
Verge to one point and blend for ever there
Of purest spirits thou pure dwelling-place
Where care and sorrow impotence and crime 
Languor disease and ignorance dare not come
O happy Earth reality of Heaven
Genius has seen thee in her passionate dreams
And dim forebodings of thy loveliness
Haunting the human heart have there entwined 
Those rooted hopes that the proud Power of Evil
Shall not for ever on this fairest world
Shake pestilence and war or that his slaves
With blasphemy for prayer and human blood
For sacrifice before his shrine for ever 
In adoration bend or Erebus
With all its banded fiends shall not uprise
To overwhelm in envy and revenge
The dauntless and the good who dare to hurl
Defiance at his throne girt tho' it be 
With Death omnipotence Thou hast beheld
His empire o'er the present and the past
It was a desolate sight now gaze on mine
Futurity Thou hoary giant Time
Render thou up thy half-devoured babes  
And from the cradles of eternity
Where millions lie lulled to their portioned sleep
By the deep murmuring stream of passing things
Tear thou that gloomy shroud Spirit behold
Thy glorious destiny The Spirit saw 
The vast frame of the renovated world
Smile in the lap of Chaos and the sense
Of hope thro' her fine texture did suffuse
Such varying glow as summer evening casts
On undulating clouds and deepening lakes 
Like the vague sighings of a wind at even
That wakes the wavelets of the slumbering sea
And dies on the creation of its breath
And sinks and rises fails and swells by fits
Was the sweet stream of thought that with wild motion 
Flowed o'er the Spirit human sympathies
The mighty tide of thought had paused awhile
Which from the Daemon now like Ocean stream
Again began to pour To me is given
The wonders of the human world to keep 
Space matter time and mind let the sight
Renew and strengthen all thy failing hope
All things are recreated and the flame
Of consentaneous love inspires all life
The fertile bosom of the earth gives suck 
To myriads who still grow beneath her care
Rewarding her with their pure perfectness
The balmy breathings of the wind inhale
Her virtues and diffuse them all abroad
Health floats amid the gentle atmosphere 
Glows in the fruits and mantles on the stream
No storms deform the beaming brow of heaven
Nor scatter in the freshness of its pride
The foliage of the undecaying trees
But fruits are ever ripe flowers ever fair 
And Autumn proudly bears her matron grace
Kindling a flush on the fair cheek of Spring
Whose virgin bloom beneath the ruddy fruit
Reflects its tint and blushes into love
The habitable earth is full of bliss 
Those wastes of frozen billows that were hurled
By everlasting snow-storms round the poles
Where matter dared not vegetate nor live
But ceaseless frost round the vast solitude
Bound its broad zone of stillness are unloosed 
And fragrant zephyrs there from spicy isles
Ruffle the placid ocean-deep that rolls
Its broad bright surges to the sloping sand
Whose roar is wakened into echoings sweet
To murmur through the heaven-breathing groves 
And melodise with man blest nature there
The vast tract of the parched and sandy waste
Now teems with countless rills and shady woods
Corn-fields and pastures and white cottages
And where the startled wilderness did hear 
A savage conqueror stained in kindred blood
Hymmng his victory or the milder snake
Crushing the bones of some frail antelope
Within his brazen folds the dewy lawn
Offering sweet incense to the sunrise smiles 
To see a babe before his mother door
Share with the green and golden basilisk
That comes to lick his feet his morning meal
Those trackless deeps where many a weary sail
Has seen above the illimitable plain 
Morning on night and night on morning rise
Whilst still no land to greet the wanderer spread
Its shadowy mountains on the sunbright sea
Where the loud roarings of the tempest-waves
So long have mingled with the gusty wind 
In melancholy loneliness and swept
The desert of those ocean solitudes
But vocal to the sea-bird harrowing shriek
The bellowing monster and the rushing storm
Now to the sweet and many-mingling sounds 
Of kindliest human impulses respond
Those lonely realms bright garden-isles begem
With lightsome clouds and shining seas between
And fertile valleys resonant with bliss
Whilst green woods overcanopy the wave 
Which like a toil-worn labourer leaps to shore
To meet the kisses of the flowerets there
Man chief perceives the change his being notes
The gradual renovation and defines
Each movement of its progress on his mind 
Man where the gloom of the long polar night
Lowered o'er the snow-clad rocks and frozen soil
Where scarce the hardiest herb that braves the frost
Basked in the moonlight ineffectual glow
Shrank with the plants and darkened with the night 
Nor where the tropics bound the realms of day
With a broad belt of mingling cloud and flame
Where blue mists through the unmoving atmosphere
Scattered the seeds of pestilence and fed
Unnatural vegetation where the land 
Teemed with all earthquake tempest and disease
Was man a nobler being slavery
Had crushed him to his country blood-stained dust
Even where the milder zone afforded man
A seeming shelter yet contagion there 
Blighting his being with unnumbered ills
Spread like a quenchless fire nor truth availed
Till late to arrest its progress or create
That peace which first in bloodless victory waved
Her snowy standard o'er this favoured clime 
There man was long the train-bearer of slaves
The mimic of surrounding misery
The jackal of ambition lion-rage
The bloodhound of religion hungry zeal
Here now the human being stands adorning 
This loveliest earth with taintless body and mind
Blest from his birth with all bland impulses
Which gently in his noble bosom wake
All kindly passions and all pure desires
Him still from hope to hope the bliss pursuing 
Which from the exhaustless lore of human weal
Dawns on the virtuous mind the thoughts that rise
In time-destroying infiniteness gift
With self-enshrined eternity that mocks
The unprevailing hoariness of age 
And man once fleeting o'er the transient scene
Swift as an unremembered vision stands
Immortal upon earth no longer now
He slays the beast that sports around his dwelling
And horribly devours its mangled flesh 
Or drinks its vital blood which like a stream
Of poison thro' his fevered veins did flow
Feeding a plague that secretly consumed
His feeble frame and kindling in his mind
Hatred despair and fear and vain belief 
The germs of misery death disease and crime
No longer now the winged habitants
That in the woods their sweet lives sing away
Flee from the form of man but gather round
And prune their sunny feathers on the hands 
Which little children stretch in friendly sport
Towards these dreadless partners of their play
All things are void of terror man has lost
His desolating privilege and stands
An equal amidst equals happiness 
And science dawn though late upon the earth
Peace cheers the mind health renovates the frame
Disease and pleasure cease to mingle here
Reason and passion cease to combat there
Whilst mind unfettered o'er the earth extends 
Its all-subduing energies and wields
The sceptre of a vast dominion there
Mild is the slow necessity of death
The tranquil spirit fails beneath its grasp
Without a groan almost without a fear 
Resigned in peace to the necessity
Calm as a voyager to some distant land
And full of wonder full of hope as he
The deadly germs of languor and disease
Waste in the human frame and Nature gifts 
With choicest boons her human worshippers
How vigorous now the athletic form of age
How clear its open and unwrinkled brow
Where neither avarice cunning pride or care
Had stamped the seal of grey deformity 
On all the mingling lineaments of time
How lovely the intrepid front of youth
How sweet the smiles of taintless infancy
Within the massy prison mouldering courts
Fearless and free the ruddy children play 
Weaving gay chaplets for their innocent brows
With the green ivy and the red wall-flower
That mock the dungeon unavailing gloom
The ponderous chains and gratings of strong iron
There rust amid the accumulated ruins 
Now mingling slowly with their native earth
There the broad beam of day which feebly once
Lighted the cheek of lean captivity
With a pale and sickly glare now freely shines
On the pure smiles of infant playfulness 
No more the shuddering voice of hoarse despair
Peals through the echoing vaults but soothing notes
Of ivy-fingered winds and gladsome birds
And merriment are resonant around
The fanes of Fear and Falsehood hear no more 
The voice that once waked multitudes to war
Thundering thro' all their aisles but now respond
To the death dirge of the melancholy wind
It were a sight of awfulness to see
The works of faith and slavery so vast 
So sumptuous yet withal so perishing
Even as the corpse that rests beneath their wall
A thousand mourners deck the pomp of death
To-day the breathing marble glows above
To decorate its memory and tongues 
Are busy of its life to-morrow worms
In silence and in darkness seize their prey
These ruins soon leave not a wreck behind
Their elements wide-scattered o'er the globe
To happier shapes are moulded and become 
Ministrant to all blissful impulses
Thus human things are perfected and earth
Even as a child beneath its mother love
Is strengthened in all excellence and grows
Fairer and nobler with each passing year 
Now Time his dusky pennons o'er the scene
Closes in steadfast darkness and the past
Fades from our charmed sight My task is done
Thy lore is learned Earth wonders are thine own
With all the fear and all the hope they bring 
My spells are past the present now recurs
Ah me a pathless wilderness remains
Yet unsubdued by man reclaiming hand
Yet human Spirit bravely hold thy course
Let virtue teach thee firmly to pursue 
The gradual paths of an aspiring change
For birth and life and death and that strange state
Before the naked powers that thro' the world
Wander like winds have found a human home
All tend to perfect happiness and urge 
The restless wheels of being on their way
Whose flashing spokes instinct with infinite life
Bicker and burn to gain their destined goal
For birth but wakes the universal mind
Whose mighty streams might else in silence flow 
Thro' the vast world to individual sense
Of outward shows whose unexperienced shape
New modes of passion to its frame may lend
Life is its state of action and the store
Of all events is aggregated there 
That variegate the eternal universe
Death is a gate of dreariness and gloom
That leads to azure isles and beaming skies
And happy regions of eternal hope
Therefore O Spirit fearlessly bear on 
Though storms may break the primrose on its stalk
Though frosts may blight the freshness of its bloom
Yet spring awakening breath will woo the earth
To feed with kindliest dews its favourite flower
That blooms in mossy banks and darksome glens 
Lighting the green wood with its sunny smile
Fear not then Spirit death disrobing hand
So welcome when the tyrant is awake
So welcome when the bigot hell-torch flares
'Tis but the voyage of a darksome hour 
The transient gulf-dream of a startling sleep
For what thou art shall perish utterly
But what is thine may never cease to be
Death is no foe to virtue earth has seen
Love brightest roses on the scaffold bloom 
Mingling with freedom fadeless laurels there
And presaging the truth of visioned bliss
Are there not hopes within thee which this scene
Of linked and gradual being has confirmed
Hopes that not vainly thou and living fires 
Of mind as radiant and as pure as thou
Have shone upon the paths of men return
Surpassing Spirit to that world where thou
Art destined an eternal war to wage
With tyranny and falsehood and uproot 
The germs of misery from the human heart
Thine is the hand whose piety would soothe
The thorny pillow of unhappy crime
Whose impotence an easy pardon gains
Watching its wanderings as a friend disease 
Thine is the brow whose mildness would defy
Its fiercest rage and brave its sternest will
When fenced by power and master of the world
Thou art sincere and good of resolute mind
Free from heart-withering custom cold control 
Of passion lofty pure and unsubdued
Earth pride and meanness could not vanquish thee
And therefore art thou worthy of the boon
Which thou hast now received virtue shall keep
Thy footsteps in the path that thou hast trod 
And many days of beaming hope shall bless
Thy spotless life of sweet and sacred love
Go happy one and give that bosom joy
Whose sleepless spirit waits to catch
Light life and rapture from thy smile 
The Daemon called its winged ministers
Speechless with bliss the Spirit mounts the car
That rolled beside the crystal battlement
Bending her beamy eyes in thankfulness
The burning wheels inflame 
The steep descent of Heaven untrodden way
Fast and far the chariot flew
The mighty globes that rolled
Around the gate of the Eternal Fane
Lessened by slow degrees and soon appeared 
Such tiny twinklers as the planet orbs
That ministering on the solar power
With borrowed light pursued their narrower way
Speeded like thought upon the light of Heaven
The Body and the Soul united then 
A gentle start convulsed Ianthe frame
Her veiny eyelids quietly unclosed
Moveless awhile the dark blue orbs remained
She looked around in wonder and beheld
Henry who kneeled in silence by her couch 
Watching her sleep with looks of speechless love
Earth Ocean Air beloved brotherhood
If our great Mother has imbued my soul
With aught of natural piety to feel
Your love and recompense the boon with mine
If dewy morn and odorous noon and even 
With sunset and its gorgeous ministers
And solemn midnight tingling silentness
If autumn hollow sighs in the sere wood
And winter robing with pure snow and crowns
Of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs 
If spring voluptuous pantings when she breathes
Her first sweet kisses have been dear to me
If no bright bird insect or gentle beast
I consciously have injured but still loved
And cherished these my kindred then forgive 
This boast beloved brethren and withdraw
No portion of your wonted favour now
Mother of this unfathomable world
Favour my solemn song for I have loved
Thee ever and thee only I have watched 
Thy shadow and the darkness of thy steps
And my heart ever gazes on the depth
Of thy deep mysteries I have made my bed
In charnels and on coffins where black death
Keeps record of the trophies won from thee 
Hoping to still these obstinate questionings
Of thee and thine by forcing some lone ghost
Thy messenger to render up the tale
Of what we are In lone and silent hours
When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness 
Like an inspired and desperate alchymist
Staking his very life on some dark hope
Have I mixed awful talk and asking looks
With my most innocent love until strange tears
Uniting with those breathless kisses made 
Such magic as compels the charmed night
To render up thy chargeand though ne'er yet
Thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary
Enough from incommunicable dream
And twilight phantasms and deep noon-day thought 
Has shone within me that serenely now
And moveless as a long-forgotten lyre
Suspended in the solitary dome
Of some mysterious and deserted fane
I wait thy breath Great Parent that my strain 
May modulate with murmurs of the air
And motions of the forests and the sea
And voice of living beings and woven hymns
Of night and day and the deep heart of man
There was a Poet whose untimely tomb 
No human hands with pious reverence reared
But the charmed eddies of autumnal winds
Built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid
Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness 
A lovely youth no mourning maiden decked 
With weeping flowers or votive cypress wreath
The lone couch of his everlasting sleep 
Gentle and brave and generous no lorn bard
Breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh
He lived he died he sung in solitude 
Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes
And virgins as unknown he passed have pined
And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes
The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn
And Silence too enamoured of that voice 
Locks its mute music in her rugged cell
By solemn vision and bright silver dream
His infancy was nurtured Every sight
And sound from the vast earth and ambient air
Sent to his heart its choicest impulses 
The fountains of divine philosophy
Fled not his thirsting lips and all of great
Or good or lovely which the sacred past
In truth or fable consecrates he felt
And knew When early youth had passed he left 
His cold fireside and alienated home
To seek strange truths in undiscovered lands
Many a wide waste and tangled wilderness
Has lured his fearless steps and he has bought
With his sweet voice and eyes from savage men 
His rest and food Nature most secret steps
He like her shadow has pursued where'er
The red volcano overcanopies
Its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice
With burning smoke or where bitumen lakes 
On black bare pointed islets ever beat
With sluggish surge or where the secret caves
Rugged and dark winding among the springs
Of fire and poison inaccessible
To avarice or pride their starry domes 
Of diamond and of gold expand above
Numberless and immeasurable halls
Frequent with crystal column and clear shrines
Of pearl and thrones radiant with chrysolite
Nor had that scene of ampler majesty 
Than gems or gold the varying roof of heaven
And the green earth lost in his heart its claims
To love and wonder he would linger long
In lonesome vales making the wild his home
Until the doves and squirrels would partake 
From his innocuous hand his bloodless food
Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks
And the wild antelope that starts whene'er
The dry leaf rustles in the brake suspend
Her timid steps to gaze upon a form
More graceful than her ownHis wandering step
Obedient to high thoughts has visited
The awful ruins of the days of old
Athens and Tyre and Balbec and the waste
Where stood Jerusalem the fallen towers 
Of Babylon the eternal pyramids
Memphis and Thebes and whatsoe'er of strange
Sculptured on alabaster obelisk
Or jasper tomb or mutilated sphynx
Dark Aethiopia in her desert hills 
Conceals Among the ruined temples there
Stupendous columns and wild images
Of more than man where marble daemons watch
The Zodiac brazen mystery and dead men
Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around 
He lingered poring on memorials
Of the world youth through the long burning day
Gazed on those speechless shapes nor when the moon
Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades
Suspended he that task but ever gazed 
And gazed till meaning on his vacant mind
Flashed like strong inspiration and he saw
The thrilling secrets of the birth of time
Meanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food
Her daily portion from her father tent 
And spread her matting for his couch and stole
From duties and repose to tend his steps
Enamoured yet not daring for deep awe
To speak her love and watched his nightly sleep
Sleepless herself to gaze upon his lips 
Parted in slumber whence the regular breath
Of innocent dreams arose then when red morn
Made paler the pale moon to her cold home
Wildered and wan and panting she returned
The Poet wandering on through Arabie 
And Persia and the wild Carmanian waste
And o'er the aerial mountains which pour down
Indus and Oxus from their icy caves
In joy and exultation held his way
Till in the vale of Cashmire far within 
Its loneliest dell where odorous plants entwine
Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower
Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched
His languid limbs A vision on his sleep
There came a dream of hopes that never yet 
Had flushed his cheek He dreamed a veiled maid
Sate near him talking in low solemn tones
Her voice was like the voice of his own soul
Heard in the calm of thought its music long
Like woven sounds of streams and breezes held 
His inmost sense suspended in its web
Of many-coloured woof and shifting hues
Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme
And lofty hopes of divine liberty
Thoughts the most dear to him and poesy 
Herself a poet Soon the solemn mood
Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame
A permeating fire wild numbers then
She raised with voice stifled in tremulous sobs
Subdued by its own pathos her fair hands 
Were bare alone sweeping from some strange harp
Strange symphony and in their branching veins
The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale
The beating of her heart was heard to fill
The pauses of her music and her breath 
Tumultuously accorded with those fits
Of intermitted song Sudden she rose
As if her heart impatiently endured
Its bursting burthen at the sound he turned
And saw by the warm light of their own life 
Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil
Of woven wind her outspread arms now bare
Her dark locks floating in the breath of night
Her beamy bending eyes her parted lips
Outstretched and pale and quivering eagerly 
His strong heart sunk and sickened with excess
Of love He reared his shuddering limbs and quelled
His gasping breath and spread his arms to meet
Her panting bosomshe drew back a while
Then yielding to the irresistible joy 
With frantic gesture and short breathless cry
Folded his frame in her dissolving arms
Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes and night
Involved and swallowed up the vision sleep
Like a dark flood suspended in its course 
Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain
Roused by the shock he started from his trance 
The cold white light of morning the blue moon
Low in the west the clear and garish hills
The distinct valley and the vacant woods 
Spread round him where he stood Whither have fled
The hues of heaven that canopied his bower
Of yesternight The sounds that soothed his sleep
The mystery and the majesty of Earth
The joy the exultation His wan eyes 
Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly
As ocean moon looks on the moon in heaven
The spirit of sweet human love has sent
A vision to the sleep of him who spurned
Her choicest gifts He eagerly pursues 
Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade
He overleaps the bounds Alas Alas
Were limbs and breath and being intertwined
Thus treacherously Lost lost for ever lost
In the wide pathless desert of dim sleep 
That beautiful shape Does the dark gate of death
Conduct to thy mysterious paradise
O Sleep Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds
And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake
Lead only to a black and watery depth 
While death blue vault with loathliest vapours hung
Where every shade which the foul grave exhales
Hides its dead eye from the detested day
Conducts O Sleep to thy delightful realms
This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart 
The insatiate hope which it awakened stung
His brain even like despair While daylight held
The sky the Poet kept mute conference
With his still soul At night the passion came
Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream 
And shook him from his rest and led him forth
Into the darkness As an eagle grasped
In folds of the green serpent feels her breast
Burn with the poison and precipitates
Through night and day tempest and calm and cloud 
Frantic with dizzying anguish her blind flight
O'er the wide aery wilderness thus driven
By the bright shadow of that lovely dream
Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night
Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells 
Startling with careless step the moonlight snake
He fled Red morning dawned upon his flight
Shedding the mockery of its vital hues
Upon his cheek of death He wandered on
Till vast Aornos seen from Petra steep 
Hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud
Through Balk and where the desolated tombs
Of Parthian kings scatter to every wind
Their wasting dust wildly he wandered on
Day after day a weary waste of hours 
Bearing within his life the brooding care
That ever fed on its decaying flame
And now his limbs were lean his scattered hair
Sered by the autumn of strange suffering
Sung dirges in the wind his listless hand 
Hung like dead bone within its withered skin
Life and the lustre that consumed it shone
As in a furnace burning secretly
From his dark eyes alone The cottagers
Who ministered with human charity 
His human wants beheld with wondering awe
Their fleeting visitant The mountaineer
Encountering on some dizzy precipice
That spectral form deemed that the Spirit of wind
With lightning eyes and eager breath and feet 
Disturbing not the drifted snow had paused
In its career the infant would conceal
His troubled visage in his mother robe
In terror at the glare of those wild eyes
To remember their strange light in many a dream 
Of after-times but youthful maidens taught
By nature would interpret half the woe
That wasted him would call him with false names
Brother and friend would press his pallid hand
At parting and watch dim through tears the path 
Of his departure from their father door
At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore
He paused a wide and melancholy waste
Of putrid marshes A strong impulse urged
His steps to the sea-shore A swan was there 
Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds
It rose as he approached and with strong wings
Scaling the upward sky bent its bright course
High over the immeasurable main
His eyes pursued its flight 'Thou hast a home 
Beautiful bird thou voyagest to thine home
Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck
With thine and welcome thy return with eyes
Bright in the lustre of their own fond joy
And what am I that I should linger here 
With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes
Spirit more vast than thine frame more attuned
To beauty wasting these surpassing powers
In the deaf air to the blind earth and heaven
That echoes not my thoughts' A gloomy smile 
Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips
For sleep he knew kept most relentlessly
Its precious charge and silent death exposed
Faithless perhaps as sleep a shadowy lure
With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms 
Startled by his own thoughts he looked around
There was no fair fiend near him not a sight
Or sound of awe but in his own deep mind
A little shallop floating near the shore
Caught the impatient wandering of his gaze 
It had been long abandoned for its sides
Gaped wide with many a rift and its frail joints
Swayed with the undulations of the tide
A restless impulse urged him to embark
And meet lone Death on the drear ocean waste 
For well he knew that mighty Shadow loves
The slimy caverns of the populous deep
The day was fair and sunny sea and sky
Drank its inspiring radiance and the wind
Swept strongly from the shore blackening the waves 
Following his eager soul the wanderer
Leaped in the boat he spread his cloak aloft
On the bare mast and took his lonely seat
And felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea
Like a torn cloud before the hurricane 
As one that in a silver vision floats
Obedient to the sweep of odorous winds
Upon resplendent clouds so rapidly
Along the dark and ruffled waters fled
The straining boat A whirlwind swept it on 
With fierce gusts and precipitating force
Through the white ridges of the chafed sea
The waves arose Higher and higher still
Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest scourge
Like serpents struggling in a vulture grasp 
Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war
Of wave ruining on wave and blast on blast
Descending and black flood on whirlpool driven
With dark obliterating course he sate
As if their genii were the ministers 
Appointed to conduct him to the light
Of those beloved eyes the Poet sate
Holding the steady helm Evening came on
The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues
High 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray 
That canopied his path o'er the waste deep
Twilight ascending slowly from the east
Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks
O'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day
Night followed clad with stars On every side 
More horribly the multitudinous streams
Of ocean mountainous waste to mutual war
Rushed in dark tumult thundering as to mock
The calm and spangled sky The little boat
Still fled before the storm still fled like foam 
Down the steep cataract of a wintry river
Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave
Now leaving far behind the bursting mass
That fell convulsing ocean safely fled 
As if that frail and wasted human form 
Had been an elemental god At midnight
The moon arose and lo the ethereal cliffs
Of Caucasus whose icy summits shone
Among the stars like sunlight and around
Whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves 
Bursting and eddying irresistibly
Rage and resound forever Who shall save 
The boat fled on the boiling torrent drove 
The crags closed round with black and jagged arms
The shattered mountain overhung the sea 
And faster still beyond all human speed
Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave
The little boat was driven A cavern there
Yawned and amid its slant and winding depths
Ingulfed the rushing sea The boat fled on 
With unrelaxing speed 'Vision and Love
The Poet cried aloud 'I have beheld
The path of thy departure Sleep and death
Shall not divide us long' The boat pursued
The windings of the cavern Daylight shone 
At length upon that gloomy river flow
Now where the fiercest war among the waves
Is calm on the unfathomable stream
The boat moved slowly Where the mountain riven
Exposed those black depths to the azure sky 
Ere yet the flood enormous volume fell
Even to the base of Caucasus with sound
That shook the everlasting rocks the mass
Filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm
Stair above stair the eddying waters rose 
Circling immeasurably fast and laved
With alternating dash the gnarled roots
Of mighty trees that stretched their giant arms
In darkness over it I' the midst was left
Reflecting yet distorting every cloud 
A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm
Seized by the sway of the ascending stream
With dizzy swiftness round and round and round
Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose
Till on the verge of the extremest curve 
Where through an opening of the rocky bank
The waters overflow and a smooth spot
Of glassy quiet mid those battling tides
Is left the boat paused shuddering Shall it sink
Down the abyss Shall the reverting stress 
Of that resistless gulf embosom it
Now shall it fall A wandering stream of wind
Breathed from the west has caught the expanded sail
And lo with gentle motion between banks
Of mossy slope and on a placid stream 
Beneath a woven grove it sails and hark
The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar
With the breeze murmuring in the musical woods
Where the embowering trees recede and leave
A little space of green expanse the cove 
Is closed by meeting banks whose yellow flowers
For ever gaze on their own drooping eyes
Reflected in the crystal calm The wave
Of the boat motion marred their pensive task
Which naught but vagrant bird or wanton wind 
Or falling spear-grass or their own decay
Had e'er disturbed before The Poet longed
To deck with their bright hues his withered hair
But on his heart its solitude returned
And he forbore Not the strong impulse hid 
In those flushed cheeks bent eyes and shadowy frame
Had yet performed its ministry it hung
Upon his life as lightning in a cloud
Gleams hovering ere it vanish ere the floods
Of night close over it The noonday sun 
Now shone upon the forest one vast mass
Of mingling shade whose brown magnificence
A narrow vale embosoms There huge caves
Scooped in the dark base of their aery rocks
Mocking its moans respond and roar for ever 
The meeting boughs and implicated leaves
Wove twilight o'er the Poet path as led
By love or dream or god or mightier Death
He sought in Nature dearest haunt some bank
Her cradle and his sepulchre More dark 
And dark the shades accumulate The oak
Expanding its immense and knotty arms
Embraces the light beech The pyramids
Of the tall cedar overarching frame
Most solemn domes within and far below 
Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky
The ash and the acacia floating hang
Tremulous and pale Like restless serpents clothed
In rainbow and in fire the parasites
Starred with ten thousand blossoms flow around 
The grey trunks and as gamesome infants' eyes
With gentle meanings and most innocent wiles
Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love
These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs
Uniting their close union the woven leaves 
Make net-work of the dark blue light of day
And the night noontide clearness mutable
As shapes in the weird clouds Soft mossy lawns
Beneath these canopies extend their swells
Fragrant with perfumed herbs and eyed with blooms 
Minute yet beautiful One darkest glen
Sends from its woods of musk-rose twined with jasmine
A soul-dissolving odour to invite
To some more lovely mystery Through the dell
Silence and Twilight here twin-sisters keep 
Their noonday watch and sail among the shades
Like vaporous shapes half-seen beyond a well
Dark gleaming and of most translucent wave
Images all the woven boughs above
And each depending leaf and every speck 
Of azure sky darting between their chasms
Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves
Its portraiture but some inconstant star
Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair
Or painted bird sleeping beneath the moon 
Or gorgeous insect floating motionless
Unconscious of the day ere yet his wings
Have spread their glories to the gaze of noon
Hither the Poet came His eyes beheld
Their own wan light through the reflected lines 
Of his thin hair distinct in the dark depth
Of that still fountain as the human heart
Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave
Sees its own treacherous likeness there He heard
The motion of the leaves the grass that sprung 
Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel
An unaccustomed presence and the sound
Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs
Of that dark fountain rose A Spirit seemed
To stand beside him clothed in no bright robes 
Of shadowy silver or enshrining light
Borrowed from aught the visible world affords
Of grace or majesty or mystery 
But undulating woods and silent well
And leaping rivulet and evening gloom 
Now deepening the dark shades for speech assuming
Held commune with him as if he and it
Were all that was onlywhen his regard
Was raised by intense pensivenesstwo eyes
Two starry eyes hung in the gloom of thought 
And seemed with their serene and azure smiles
To beckon him Obedient to the light
That shone within his soul he went pursuing
The windings of the dell The rivulet
Wanton and wild through many a green ravine 
Beneath the forest flowed Sometimes it fell
Among the moss with hollow harmony
Dark and profound Now on the polished stones
It danced like childhood laughing as it went
Then through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept 
Reflecting every herb and drooping bud
That overhung its quietness 'O stream
Whose source is inaccessibly profound
Whither do thy mysterious waters tend
Thou imagest my life Thy darksome stillness 
Thy dazzling waves thy loud and hollow gulfs
Thy searchless fountain and invisible course
Have each their type in me and the wide sky
And measureless ocean may declare as soon
What oozy cavern or what wandering cloud 
Contains thy waters as the universe
Tell where these living thoughts reside when stretched
Upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste
I' the passing wind' Beside the grassy shore
Of the small stream he went he did impress 
On the green moss his tremulous step that caught
Strong shuddering from his burning limbs As one
Roused by some joyous madness from the couch
Of fever he did move yet not like him
Forgetful of the grave where when the flame 
Of his frail exultation shall be spent
He must descend With rapid steps he went
Beneath the shade of trees beside the flow
Of the wild babbling rivulet and now
The forest solemn canopies were changed 
For the uniform and lightsome evening sky
Grey rocks did peep from the spare moss and stemmed
The struggling brook tall spires of windlestrae
Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope
And nought but gnarled roots of ancient pines 
Branchless and blasted clenched with grasping roots
The unwilling soil A gradual change was here
Yet ghastly For as fast years flow away
The smooth brow gathers and the hair grows thin
And white and where irradiate dewy eyes 
Had shone gleam stony orbs so from his steps
Bright flowers departed and the beautiful shade
Of the green groves with all their odorous winds
And musical motions Calm he still pursued
The stream that with a larger volume now 
Rolled through the labyrinthine dell and there
Fretted a path through its descending curves
With its wintry speed On every side now rose
Rocks which in unimaginable forms
Lifted their black and barren pinnacles 
In the light of evening and its precipice
Obscuring the ravine disclosed above
Mid toppling stones black gulfs and yawning caves
Whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues
To the loud stream Lo where the pass expands 
Its stony jaws the abrupt mountain breaks
And seems with its accumulated crags
To overhang the world for wide expand
Beneath the wan stars and descending moon
Islanded seas blue mountains mighty streams 
Dim tracts and vast robed in the lustrous gloom
Of leaden-coloured even and fiery hills
Mingling their flames with twilight on the verge
Of the remote horizon The near scene
In naked and severe simplicity 
Made contrast with the universe A pine
Rock-rooted stretched athwart the vacancy
Its swinging boughs to each inconstant blast
Yielding one only response at each pause
In most familiar cadence with the howl 
The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams
Mingling its solemn song whilst the broad river
Foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path
Fell into that immeasurable void
Scattering its waters to the passing winds 
Yet the grey precipice and solemn pine
And torrent were not all one silent nook
Was there Even on the edge of that vast mountain
Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks
It overlooked in its serenity 
The dark earth and the bending vault of stars
It was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile
Even in the lap of horror Ivy clasped
The fissured stones with its entwining arms
And did embower with leaves for ever green 
And berries dark the smooth and even space
Of its inviolated floor and here
The children of the autumnal whirlwind bore
In wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay
Red yellow or ethereally pale 
Rivals the pride of summer 'Tis the haunt
Of every gentle wind whose breath can teach
The wilds to love tranquillity One step
One human step alone has ever broken
The stillness of its solitude one voice 
Alone inspired its echoes even that voice
Which hither came floating among the winds
And led the loveliest among human forms
To make their wild haunts the depository
Of all the grace and beauty that endued 
Its motions render up its majesty
Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm
And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould
Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss
Commit the colours of that varying cheek 
That snowy breast those dark and drooping eyes
The dim and horned moon hung low and poured
A sea of lustre on the horizon verge
That overflowed its mountains Yellow mist
Filled the unbounded atmosphere and drank 
Wan moonlight even to fulness not a star
Shone not a sound was heard the very winds
Danger grim playmates on that precipice
Slept clasped in his embrace O storm of death
Whose sightless speed divides this sullen night 
And thou colossal Skeleton that still
Guiding its irresistible career
In thy devastating omnipotence
Art king of this frail world from the red field
Of slaughter from the reeking hospital 
The patriot sacred couch the snowy bed
Of innocence the scaffold and the throne
A mighty voice invokes thee Ruin calls
His brother Death A rare and regal prey
He hath prepared prowling around the world 
Glutted with which thou mayst repose and men
Go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms
Nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine
The unheeded tribute of a broken heart
When on the threshold of the green recess 
The wanderer footsteps fell he knew that death
Was on him Yet a little ere it fled
Did he resign his high and holy soul
To images of the majestic past
That paused within his passive being now 
Like winds that bear sweet music when they breathe
Through some dim latticed chamber He did place
His pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk
Of the old pine Upon an ivied stone
Reclined his languid head his limbs did rest 
Diffused and motionless on the smooth brink
Of that obscurest chasm and thus he lay
Surrendering to their final impulses
The hovering powers of life Hope and despair
The torturers slept no mortal pain or fear 
Marred his repose the influxes of sense
And his own being unalloyed by pain
Yet feebler and more feeble calmly fed
The stream of thought till he lay breathing there
At peace and faintly smiling his last sight 
Was the great moon which o'er the western line
Of the wide world her mighty horn suspended
With whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed
To mingle Now upon the jagged hills
It rests and still as the divided frame 
Of the vast meteor sunk the Poet blood
That ever beat in mystic sympathy
With nature ebb and flow grew feebler still
And when two lessening points of light alone
Gleamed through the darkness the alternate gasp 
Of his faint respiration scarce did stir
The stagnate night till the minutest ray
Was quenched the pulse yet lingered in his heart
It paused it fluttered But when heaven remained
Utterly black the murky shades involved 
An image silent cold and motionless
As their own voiceless earth and vacant air
Even as a vapour fed with golden beams
That ministered on sunlight ere the west
Eclipses it was now that wondrous frame  
No sense no motion no divinity 
A fragile lute on whose harmonious strings
The breath of heaven did wander a bright stream
Once fed with many-voiced waves a dream
Of youth which night and time have quenched for ever 
Still dark and dry and unremembered now
Oh for Medea wondrous alchemy
Which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam
With bright flowers and the wintry boughs exhale
From vernal blooms fresh fragrance O that God 
Profuse of poisons would concede the chalice
Which but one living man has drained who now
Vessel of deathless wrath a slave that feels
No proud exemption in the blighting curse
He bears over the world wanders for ever 
Lone as incarnate death O that the dream
Of dark magician in his visioned cave
Raking the cinders of a crucible
For life and power even when his feeble hand
Shakes in its last decay were the true law 
Of this so lovely world But thou art fled
Like some frail exhalation which the dawn
Robes in its golden beams ah thou hast fled
The brave the gentle and the beautiful
The child of grace and genius Heartless things 
Are done and said i' the world and many worms
And beasts and men live on and mighty Earth
From sea and mountain city and wilderness
In vesper low or joyous orison
Lifts still its solemn voice but thou art fled  
Thou canst no longer know or love the shapes
Of this phantasmal scene who have to thee
Been purest ministers who are alas
Now thou art not Upon those pallid lips
So sweet even in their silence on those eyes 
That image sleep in death upon that form
Yet safe from the worm outrage let no tear
Be shed not even in thought Nor when those hues
Are gone and those divinest lineaments
Worn by the senseless wind shall live alone 
In the frail pauses of this simple strain
Let not high verse mourning the memory
Of that which is no more or painting woe
Or sculpture speak in feeble imagery
Their own cold powers Art and eloquence 
And all the shows o' the world are frail and vain
To weep a loss that turns their lights to shade
It is a woe too deep for tears when all
Is reft at once when some surpassing Spirit
Whose light adorned the world around it leaves 
Those who remain behind not sobs or groans
The passionate tumult of a clinging hope
But pale despair and cold tranquillity
Nature vast frame the web of human things
Birth and the grave that are not as they were 
There was a youth who as with toil and travel
Had grown quite weak and gray before his time
Nor any could the restless griefs unravel
Which burned within him withering up his prime
And goading him like fiends from land to land 
Not his the load of any secret crime
For nought of ill his heart could understand
But pity and wild sorrow for the same 
Not his the thirst for glory or command
Baffled with blast of hope-consuming shame 
Nor evil joys which fire the vulgar breast
And quench in speedy smoke its feeble flame
Had left within his soul their dark unrest
Nor what religion fables of the grave
Feared he Philosophy accepted guest 
For none than he a purer heart could have
Or that loved good more for itself alone
Of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave
What sorrow strange and shadowy and unknown
Sent him a hopeless wanderer through mankind  
If with a human sadness he did groan
He had a gentle yet aspiring mind
Just innocent with varied learning fed
And such a glorious consolation find
In others' joy when all their own is dead 
He loved and laboured for his kind in grief
And yet unlike all others it is said
That from such toil he never found relief
Although a child of fortune and of power
Of an ancestral name the orphan chief 
His soul had wedded Wisdom and her dower
Is love and justice clothed in which he sate
Apart from men as in a lonely tower
Pitying the tumult of their dark estate 
Yet even in youth did he not e'er abuse 
The strength of wealth or thought to consecrate
Those false opinions which the harsh rich use
To blind the world they famish for their pride
Nor did he hold from any man his dues
But like a steward in honest dealings tried 
With those who toiled and wept the poor and wise
His riches and his cares he did divide
Fearless he was and scorning all disguise
What he dared do or think though men might start
He spoke with mild yet unaverted eyes 
Liberal he was of soul and frank of heart
And to his many friends all loved him well 
Whate'er he knew or felt he would impart
If words he found those inmost thoughts to tell
If not he smiled or wept and his weak foes 
He neither spurned nor hated though with fell
And mortal hate their thousand voices rose
They passed like aimless arrows from his ear 
Nor did his heart or mind its portal close
To those or them or any whom life sphere 
May comprehend within its wide array
What sadness made that vernal spirit sere 
He knew not Though his life day after day
Was failing like an unreplenished stream
Though in his eyes a cloud and burthen lay 
Through which his soul like Vesper serene beam
Piercing the chasms of ever rising clouds
Shone softly burning though his lips did seem
Like reeds which quiver in impetuous floods
And through his sleep and o'er each waking hour 
Thoughts after thoughts unresting multitudes
Were driven within him by some secret power
Which bade them blaze and live and roll afar
Like lights and sounds from haunted tower to tower
O'er castled mountains borne when tempest war 
Is levied by the night-contending winds
And the pale dalesmen watch with eager ear 
Though such were in his spirit as the fiends
Which wake and feed an everliving woe 
What was this grief which ne'er in other minds 
A mirror found he knew not none could know
But on whoe'er might question him he turned
The light of his frank eyes as if to show
He knew not of the grief within that burned
But asked forbearance with a mournful look 
Or spoke in words from which none ever learned
The cause of his disquietude or shook
With spasms of silent passion or turned pale
So that his friends soon rarely undertook
To stir his secret pain without avail  
For all who knew and loved him then perceived
That there was drawn an adamantine veil
Between his heart and mind both unrelieved
Wrought in his brain and bosom separate strife
Some said that he was mad others believed 
That memories of an antenatal life
Made this where now he dwelt a penal hell
And others said that such mysterious grief
From God displeasure like a darkness fell
On souls like his which owned no higher law 
Than love love calm steadfast invincible
By mortal fear or supernatural awe
And others ''Tis the shadow of a dream
Which the veiled eye of Memory never saw
'But through the soul abyss like some dark stream 
Through shattered mines and caverns underground
Rolls shaking its foundations and no beam
'Of joy may rise but it is quenched and drowned
In the dim whirlpools of this dream obscure
Soon its exhausted waters will have found 
'A lair of rest beneath thy spirit pure
O Athanase in one so good and great
Evil or tumult cannot long endure
So spake they idly of another state
Babbling vain words and fond philosophy 
This was their consolation such debate
Men held with one another nor did he
Like one who labours with a human woe
Decline this talk as if its theme might be
Another not himself he to and fro 
Questioned and canvassed it with subtlest wit
And none but those who loved him best could know
That which he knew not how it galled and bit
His weary mind this converse vain and cold
For like an eyeless nightmare grief did sit 
Upon his being a snake which fold by fold
Pressed out the life of life a clinging fiend
Which clenched him if he stirred with deadlier hold 
And so his grief remained let it remain untold 
Prince Athanase had one beloved friend 
An old old man with hair of silver white
And lips where heavenly smiles would hang and blend
With his wise words and eyes whose arrowy light
Shone like the reflex of a thousand minds
He was the last whom superstition blight 
Had spared in Greece the blight that cramps and blinds 
And in his olive bower at Oenoe
Had sate from earliest youth Like one who finds
A fertile island in the barren sea
One mariner who has survived his mates 
Many a drear month in a great ship so he
With soul-sustaining songs and sweet debates
Of ancient lore there fed his lonely being 
'The mind becomes that which it contemplates' 
And thus Zonoras by for ever seeing 
Their bright creations grew like wisest men
And when he heard the crash of nations fleeing
A bloodier power than ruled thy ruins then
O sacred Hellas many weary years
He wandered till the path of Laian glen 
Was grass-grown and the unremembered tears
Were dry in Laian for their honoured chief
Who fell in Byzant pierced by Moslem spears 
And as the lady looked with faithful grief
From her high lattice o'er the rugged path 
Where she once saw that horseman toil with brief
And blighting hope who with the news of death
Struck body and soul as with a mortal blight
She saw between the chestnuts far beneath
An old man toiling up a weary wight 
And soon within her hospitable hall
She saw his white hairs glittering in the light
Of the wood fire and round his shoulders fall
And his wan visage and his withered mien
Yet calm and gentle and majestical 
And Athanase her child who must have been
Then three years old sate opposite and gazed
In patient silence
Such was Zonoras and as daylight finds
One amaranth glittering on the path of frost 
When autumn nights have nipped all weaker kinds
Thus through his age dark cold and tempest-tossed
Shone truth upon Zonoras and he filled
From fountains pure nigh overgrown and lost
The spirit of Prince Athanase a child 
With soul-sustaining songs of ancient lore
And philosophic wisdom clear and mild
And sweet and subtle talk they evermore
The pupil and the master shared until
Sharing that undiminishable store 
The youth as shadows on a grassy hill
Outrun the winds that chase them soon outran
His teacher and did teach with native skill
Strange truths and new to that experienced man
Still they were friends as few have ever been 
Who mark the extremes of life discordant span
So in the caverns of the forest green
Or on the rocks of echoing ocean hoar
Zonoras and Prince Athanase were seen
By summer woodmen and when winter roar 
Sounded o'er earth and sea its blast of war
The Balearic fisher driven from shore
Hanging upon the peaked wave afar
Then saw their lamp from Laian turret gleam
Piercing the stormy darkness like a star 
Which pours beyond the sea one steadfast beam
Whilst all the constellations of the sky
Seemed reeling through the stormThey did but seem 
For lo the wintry clouds are all gone by
And bright Arcturus through yon pines is glowing 
And far o'er southern waves immovably
Belted Orion hangs warm light is flowing
From the young moon into the sunset chasm 
'O summer eve with power divine bestowing
'On thine own bird the sweet enthusiasm 
Which overflows in notes of liquid gladness
Filling the sky like light How many a spasm
'Of fevered brains oppressed with grief and madness
Were lulled by thee delightful nightingale 
And these soft waves murmuring a gentle sadness  
'And the far sighings of yon piny dale
Made vocal by some wind we feel not here 
I bear alone what nothing may avail
'To lighten a strange load' No human ear
Heard this lament but o'er the visage wan 
Of Athanase a ruffling atmosphere
Of dark emotion a swift shadow ran
Like wind upon some forest-bosomed lake
Glassy and dark And that divine old man
Beheld his mystic friend whole being shake 
Even where its inmost depths were gloomiest 
And with a calm and measured voice he spake
And with a soft and equal pressure pressed
That cold lean hand 'Dost thou remember yet
When the curved moon then lingering in the west 
'Paused in yon waves her mighty horns to wet
How in those beams we walked half resting on the sea
'Tis just one year sure thou dost not forget 
'Then Plato words of light in thee and me
Lingered like moonlight in the moonless east 
For we had just then read thy memory
'Is faithful now the story of the feast
And Agathon and Diotima seemed
From death and dark forgetfulness released
And when the old man saw that on the green
Leaves of his opening a blight had lighted 
He said 'My friend one grief alone can wean
A gentle mind from all that once delighted 
Thou lovest and thy secret heart is laden
With feelings which should not be unrequited' 
And Athanase then smiled as one o'erladen
With iron chains might smile to talk of bands
Twined round her lover neck by some blithe maiden
And said
'Twas at the season when the Earth upsprings 
From slumber as a sphered angel child
Shadowing its eyes with green and golden wings
Stands up before its mother bright and mild
Of whose soft voice the air expectant seems 
So stood before the sun which shone and smiled 
To see it rise thus joyous from its dreams
The fresh and radiant Earth The hoary grove
Waxed green and flowers burst forth like starry beams 
The grass in the warm sun did start and move
And sea-buds burst under the waves serene  
How many a one though none be near to love
Loves then the shade of his own soul half seen
In any mirror or the spring young minions
The winged leaves amid the copses green 
How many a spirit then puts on the pinions 
Of fancy and outstrips the lagging blast
And his own steps and over wide dominions
Sweeps in his dream-drawn chariot far and fast
More fleet than storms the wide world shrinks below
When winter and despondency are past 
'Twas at this season that Prince Athanase
Passed the white Alps those eagle-baffling mountains
Slept in their shrouds of snow beside the ways
The waterfalls were voiceless for their fountains
Were changed to mines of sunless crystal now 
Or by the curdling winds like brazen wings
Which clanged along the mountain marble brow 
Warped into adamantine fretwork hung
And filled with frozen light the chasms below
Vexed by the blast the great pines groaned and swung 
Such as the eagle sees when he dives down
From the gray deserts of wide air beheld 
The shadow of that scene field after field
Thou art the wine whose drunkenness is all
We can desire O Love and happy souls 
Ere from thy vine the leaves of autumn fall
Catch thee and feed from their o'erflowing bowls
Thousands who thirst for thine ambrosial dew 
Thou art the radiance which where ocean rolls
Investeth it and when the heavens are blue 
Thou fillest them and when the earth is fair
The shadow of thy moving wings imbue
Its deserts and its mountains till they wear
Beauty like some light robe thou ever soarest
Among the towers of men and as soft air 
In spring which moves the unawakened forest
Clothing with leaves its branches bare and bleak
Thou floatest among men and aye implorest
That which from thee they should implore the weak
Alone kneel to thee offering up the hearts 
The strong have broken yet where shall any seek
A garment whom thou clothest not the darts
Of the keen winter storm barbed with frost
Which from the everlasting snow that parts
I rode one evening with Count Maddalo
Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow
Of Adria towards Venice a bare strand
Of hillocks heaped from ever-shifting sand
Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds 
Such as from earth embrace the salt ooze breeds
Is this an uninhabited sea-side
Which the lone fisher when his nets are dried
Abandons and no other object breaks
The waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes 
Broken and unrepaired and the tide makes
A narrow space of level sand thereon
Where 'twas our wont to ride while day went down
This ride was my delight I love all waste
And solitary places where we taste 
The pleasure of believing what we see
Is boundless as we wish our souls to be
And such was this wide ocean and this shore
More barren than its billows and yet more
Than all with a remembered friend I love 
To ride as then I rode for the winds drove
The living spray along the sunny air
Into our faces the blue heavens were bare
Stripped to their depths by the awakening north
And from the waves sound like delight broke forth 
Harmonising with solitude and sent
Into our hearts aereal merriment
So as we rode we talked and the swift thought
Winging itself with laughter lingered not
But flew from brain to brain such glee was ours 
Charged with light memories of remembered hours
None slow enough for sadness till we came
Homeward which always makes the spirit tame
This day had been cheerful but cold and now
The sun was sinking and the wind also 
Our talk grew somewhat serious as may be
Talk interrupted with such raillery
As mocks itself because it cannot scorn
The thoughts it would extinguish  'twas forlorn
Yet pleasing such as once so poets tell 
The devils held within the dales of Hell
Concerning God freewill and destiny
Of all that earth has been or yet may be
All that vain men imagine or believe
Or hope can paint or suffering may achieve 
We descanted and I for ever still
Is it not wise to make the best of ill
Argued against despondency but pride
Made my companion take the darker side
The sense that he was greater than his kind 
Had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind
By gazing on its own exceeding light
Meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight
Over the horizon of the mountains Oh
How beautiful is sunset when the glow 
Of Heaven descends upon a land like thee
Thou Paradise of exiles Italy
Thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers
Of cities they encircle it was ours
To stand on thee beholding it and then 
Just where we had dismounted the Count men
Were waiting for us with the gondola 
As those who pause on some delightful way
Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood
Looking upon the evening and the flood 
Which lay between the city and the shore
Paved with the image of the skythe hoar
And aery Alps towards the North appeared
Through mist an heaven-sustaining bulwark reared
Between the East and West and half the sky 
Was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry
Dark purple at the zenith which still grew
Down the steep West into a wondrous hue
Brighter than burning gold even to the rent
Where the swift sun yet paused in his descent 
Among the many-folded hills they were
Those famous Euganean hills which bear
As seen from Lido thro' the harbour piles
The likeness of a clump of peaked isles 
And then as if the Earth and Sea had been 
Dissolved into one lake of fire were seen
Those mountains towering as from waves of flame
Around the vaporous sun from which there came
The inmost purple spirit of light and made
Their very peaks transparent 'Ere it fade' 
Said my companion 'I will show you soon
A better station' so o'er the lagune
We glided and from that funereal bark
I leaned and saw the city and could mark
How from their many isles in evening gleam 
Its temples and its palaces did seem
Like fabrics of enchantment piled to Heaven
I was about to speak when 'We are even
Now at the point I meant' said Maddalo
And bade the gondolieri cease to row 
'Look Julian on the west and listen well
If you hear not a deep and heavy bell
I looked and saw between us and the sun
A building on an island such a one
As age to age might add for uses vile 
A windowless deformed and dreary pile
And on the top an open tower where hung
A bell which in the radiance swayed and swung
We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue
The broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled 
In strong and black relief 'What we behold
Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower
Said Maddalo 'and ever at this hour
Those who may cross the water hear that bell
Which calls the maniacs each one from his cell 
To vespers' 'As much skill as need to pray
In thanks or hope for their dark lot have they
To their stern maker' I replied 'O ho
You talk as in years past' said Maddalo
''Tis strange men change not You were ever still 
Among Christ flock a perilous infidel
A wolf for the meek lambs if you can't swim
Beware of Providence' I looked on him
But the gay smile had faded in his eye
'And such' he cried 'is our mortality 
And this must be the emblem and the sign
Of what should be eternal and divine 
And like that black and dreary bell the soul
Hung in a heaven-illumined tower must toll
Our thoughts and our desires to meet below 
Round the rent heart and pray as madmen do
For what they know not till the night of death
As sunset that strange vision severeth
Our memory from itself and us from all
We sought and yet were baffled' I recall 
The sense of what he said although I mar
The force of his expressions The broad star
Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill
And the black bell became invisible
And the red tower looked gray and all between 
The churches ships and palaces were seen
Huddled in gloom into the purple sea
The orange hues of heaven sunk silently
We hardly spoke and soon the gondola
Conveyed me to my lodging by the way 
The following morn was rainy cold and dim
Ere Maddalo arose I called on him
And whilst I waited with his child I played
A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made
A serious subtle wild yet gentle being 
Graceful without design and unforeseeing
With eyes Oh speak not of her eyes which seem
Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven yet gleam
With such deep meaning as we never see
But in the human countenance with me 
She was a special favourite I had nursed
Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first
To this bleak world and she yet seemed to know
On second sight her ancient playfellow
Less changed than she was by six months or so 
For after her first shyness was worn out
We sate there rolling billiard balls about
When the Count entered Salutations past 
'The word you spoke last night might well have cast
A darkness on my spirit if man be 
The passive thing you say I should not see
Much harm in the religions and old saws
Tho' I may never own such leaden laws
Which break a teachless nature to the yoke
Mine is another faith' thus much I spoke 
And noting he replied not added 'See
This lovely child blithe innocent and free
She spends a happy time with little care
While we to such sick thoughts subjected are
As came on you last night It is our will 
That thus enchains us to permitted ill 
We might be otherwise we might be all
We dream of happy high majestical
Where is the love beauty and truth we seek
But in our mind and if we were not weak 
Should we be less in deed than in desire
'Ay if we were not weak and we aspire
How vainly to be strong' said Maddalo
'You talk Utopia' 'It remains to know
I then rejoined 'and those who try may find 
How strong the chains are which our spirit bind
Brittle perchance as strawWe are assured
Much may be conquered much may be endured
Of what degrades and crushes us We know
That we have power over ourselves to do 
And suffer what we know not till we try
But something nobler than to live and die 
So taught those kings of old philosophy
Who reigned before Religion made men blind
And those who suffer with their suffering kind 
Yet feel their faith religion' 'My dear friend
Said Maddalo 'my judgement will not bend
To your opinion though I think you might
Make such a system refutation-tight
As far as words go I knew one like you 
Who to this city came some months ago
With whom I argued in this sort and he
Is now gone mad and so he answered me 
Poor fellow but if you would like to go
We'll visit him and his wild talk will show 
How vain are such aspiring theories
'I hope to prove the induction otherwise
And that a want of that true theory still
Which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill
Or in himself or others has thus bowed 
His being there are some by nature proud
Who patient in all else demand but this 
To love and be beloved with gentleness
And being scorned what wonder if they die
Some living death this is not destiny 
But man own wilful ill' As thus I spoke
Servants announced the gondola and we
Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea
Sailed to the island where the madhouse stands
We disembarked The clap of tortured hands 
Fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen
And laughter where complaint had merrier been
Moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers
Accosted us We climbed the oozy stairs
Into an old courtyard I heard on high 
Then fragments of most touching melody
But looking up saw not the singer there 
Through the black bars in the tempestuous air
I saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing
Long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing 
Of those who on a sudden were beguiled
Into strange silence and looked forth and smiled
Hearing sweet sounds Then I 'Methinks there were
A cure of these with patience and kind care
If music can thus movebut what is he 
Whom we seek here' 'Of his sad history
I know but this' said Maddalo 'he came
To Venice a dejected man and fame
Said he was wealthy or he had been so
Some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe 
But he was ever talking in such sort
As you do far more sadly he seemed hurt
Even as a man with his peculiar wrong
To hear but of the oppression of the strong
Or those absurd deceits I think with you 
In some respects you know which carry through
The excellent impostors of this earth
When they outface detection he had worth
Poor fellow but a humorist in his way' 
'Alas what drove him mad' 'I cannot say 
A lady came with him from France and when
She left him and returned he wandered then
About yon lonely isles of desert sand
Till he grew wild he had no cash or land
Remaining the police had brought him here  
Some fancy took him and he would not bear
Removal so I fitted up for him
Those rooms beside the sea to please his whim
And sent him busts and books and urns for flowers
Which had adorned his life in happier hours 
And instruments of music you may guess
A stranger could do little more or less
For one so gentle and unfortunate
And those are his sweet strains which charm the weight
From madmen chains and make this Hell appear 
A heaven of sacred silence hushed to hear' 
'Nay this was kind of you he had no claim
As the world says' 'None but the very same
Which I on all mankind were I as he
Fallen to such deep reverse his melody 
Is interrupted now we hear the din
Of madmen shriek on shriek again begin
Let us now visit him after this strain
He ever communes with himself again
And sees nor hears not any' Having said 
These words we called the keeper and he led
To an apartment opening on the sea 
There the poor wretch was sitting mournfully
Near a piano his pale fingers twined
One with the other and the ooze and wind 
Rushed through an open casement and did sway
His hair and starred it with the brackish spray
His head was leaning on a music book
And he was muttering and his lean limbs shook
His lips were pressed against a folded leaf 
In hue too beautiful for health and grief
Smiled in their motions as they lay apart 
As one who wrought from his own fervid heart
The eloquence of passion soon he raised
His sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed 
And spoke sometimes as one who wrote and thought
His words might move some heart that heeded not
If sent to distant lands and then as one
Reproaching deeds never to be undone
With wondering self-compassion then his speech 
Was lost in grief and then his words came each
Unmodulated cold expressionless 
But that from one jarred accent you might guess
It was despair made them so uniform
And all the while the loud and gusty storm 
Hissed through the window and we stood behind
Stealing his accents from the envious wind
Unseen I yet remember what he said
Distinctly such impression his words made
'Month after month' he cried 'to bear this load 
And as a jade urged by the whip and goad
To drag life on which like a heavy chain
Lengthens behind with many a link of pain 
And not to speak my grief O not to dare
To give a human voice to my despair 
But live and move and wretched thing smile on
As if I never went aside to groan
And wear this mask of falsehood even to those
Who are most dear not for my own repose 
Alas no scorn or pain or hate could be 
So heavy as that falsehood is to me 
But that I cannot bear more altered faces
Than needs must be more changed and cold embraces
More misery disappointment and mistrust
To own me for their fatherWould the dust 
Were covered in upon my body now
That the life ceased to toil within my brow
And then these thoughts would at the least be fled
Let us not fear such pain can vex the dead
'What Power delights to torture us I know 
That to myself I do not wholly owe
What now I suffer though in part I may
Alas none strewed sweet flowers upon the way
Where wandering heedlessly I met pale Pain
My shadow which will leave me not again  
If I have erred there was no joy in error
But pain and insult and unrest and terror
I have not as some do bought penitence
With pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence
For then if love and tenderness and truth 
Had overlived hope momentary youth
My creed should have redeemed me from repenting
But loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting
Met love excited by far other seeming
Until the end was gainedas one from dreaming 
Of sweetest peace I woke and found my state
Such as it is 
'O Thou my spirit mate
Who for thou art compassionate and wise
Wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes
If this sad writing thou shouldst ever see  
My secret groans must be unheard by thee
Thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know
Thy lost friend incommunicable woe
'Ye few by whom my nature has been weighed
In friendship let me not that name degrade 
By placing on your hearts the secret load
Which crushes mine to dust There is one road
To peace and that is truth which follow ye
Love sometimes leads astray to misery
Yet think not though subdued and I may well 
Say that I am subdued that the full Hell
Within me would infect the untainted breast
Of sacred nature with its own unrest
As some perverted beings think to find
In scorn or hate a medicine for the mind 
Which scorn or hate have wounded O how vain
The dagger heals not but may rend again
Believe that I am ever still the same
In creed as in resolve and what may tame
My heart must leave the understanding free 
Or all would sink in this keen agony 
Nor dream that I will join the vulgar cry
Or with my silence sanction tyranny
Or seek a moment shelter from my pain
In any madness which the world calls gain 
Ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern
As those which make me what I am or turn
To avarice or misanthropy or lust
Heap on me soon O grave thy welcome dust
Till then the dungeon may demand its prey 
And Poverty and Shame may meet and say 
Halting beside me on the public way 
That love-devoted youth is ours let sit
Beside him he may live some six months yet
Or the red scaffold as our country bends 
May ask some willing victim or ye friends
May fall under some sorrow which this heart
Or hand may share or vanquish or avert
I am prepared in truth with no proud joy 
To do or suffer aught as when a boy 
I did devote to justice and to love
My nature worthless now 'I must remove
A veil from my pent mind 'Tis torn aside
O pallid as Death dedicated bride
Thou mockery which art sitting by my side 
Am I not wan like thee at the grave call
I haste invited to thy wedding-ball
To greet the ghastly paramour for whom
Thou hast deserted meand made the tomb
Thy bridal bedBut I beside your feet 
Will lie and watch ye from my winding-sheet 
Thuswide awake tho' deadyet stay O stay
Go not so soon I know not what I say 
Hear but my reasonsI am mad I fear
My fancy is o'erwroughtthou art not here 
Pale art thou 'tis most truebut thou art gone
Thy work is finishedI am left alone 
'Nay was it I who wooed thee to this breast
Which like a serpent thou envenomest
As in repayment of the warmth it lent 
Didst thou not seek me for thine own content
Did not thy love awaken mine I thought
That thou wert she who said You kiss me not
Ever I fear you do not love me now 
In truth I loved even to my overthrow 
Her who would fain forget these words but they
Cling to her mind and cannot pass away
'You say that I am proud that when I speak
My lip is tortured with the wrongs which break
The spirit it expressesNever one 
Humbled himself before as I have done
Even the instinctive worm on which we tread
Turns though it wound not then with prostrate head
Sinks in the dusk and writhes like me and dies
No wears a living death of agonies 
As the slow shadows of the pointed grass
Mark the eternal periods his pangs pass
Slow ever-moving making moments be
As mine seem each an immortality
'That you had never seen me never heard 
My voice and more than all had ne'er endured
The deep pollution of my loathed embrace 
That your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face 
That like some maniac monk I had torn out
The nerves of manhood by their bleeding root 
With mine own quivering fingers so that ne'er
Our hearts had for a moment mingled there
To disunite in horror these were not
With thee like some suppressed and hideous thought
Which flits athwart our musings but can find 
No rest within a pure and gentle mind
Thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word
And searedst my memory o'er them for I heard
And can forget notthey were ministered
One after one those curses Mix them up 
Like self-destroying poisons in one cup
And they will make one blessing which thou ne'er
Didst imprecate for on me death 'It were
A cruel punishment for one most cruel
If such can love to make that love the fuel 
Of the mind hell hate scorn remorse despair
But ME whose heart a stranger tear might wear
As water-drops the sandy fountain-stone
Who loved and pitied all things and could moan
For woes which others hear not and could see 
The absent with the glance of phantasy
And with the poor and trampled sit and weep
Following the captive to his dungeon deep
ME who am as a nerve o'er which do creep
The else unfelt oppressions of this earth 
And was to thee the flame upon thy hearth
When all beside was cold that thou on me
Shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony 
Such curses are from lips once eloquent
With love too partial praise let none relent 
Who intend deeds too dreadful for a name
Henceforth if an example for the same
They seekfor thou on me lookedst so and so 
And didst speak thusand thusI live to show
How much men bear and die not 'Thou wilt tell 
With the grimace of hate how horrible
It was to meet my love when thine grew less
Thou wilt admire how I could e'er address
Such features to love workthis taunt though true
For indeed Nature nor in form nor hue 
Bestowed on me her choicest workmanship
Shall not be thy defencefor since thy lip
Met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled
With soft fire under mine I have not dwindled
Nor changed in mind or body or in aught 
But as love changes what it loveth not
After long years and many trials 'How vain
Are words I thought never to speak again
Not even in secret not to mine own heart 
But from my lips the unwilling accents start 
And from my pen the words flow as I write
Dazzling my eyes with scalding tearsmy sight
Is dim to see that charactered in vain
On this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain
And eats into itblotting all things fair 
And wise and good which time had written there
'Those who inflict must suffer for they see
The work of their own hearts and this must be
Our chastisement or recompense O child
I would that thine were like to be more mild 
For both our wretched sakesfor thine the most
Who feelest already all that thou hast lost
Without the power to wish it thine again
And as slow years pass a funereal train
Each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend 
Following it like its shadow wilt thou bend
No thought on my dead memory 'Alas love
Fear me notagainst thee I would not move
A finger in despite Do I not live
That thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve 
I give thee tears for scorn and love for hate
And that thy lot may be less desolate
Than his on whom thou tramplest I refrain
From that sweet sleep which medicines all pain
Then when thou speakest of me never say 
He could forgive not Here I cast away
All human passions all revenge all pride
I think speak act no ill I do but hide
Under these words like embers every spark
Of that which has consumed me quick and dark 
The grave is yawningas its roof shall cover
My limbs with dust and worms under and over
So let Oblivion hide this griefthe air
Closes upon my accents as despair
Upon my heart let death upon despair' 
He ceased and overcome leant back awhile
Then rising with a melancholy smile
Went to a sofa and lay down and slept
A heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept
And muttered some familiar name and we 
Wept without shame in his society
I think I never was impressed so much
The man who were not must have lacked a touch
Of human naturethen we lingered not
Although our argument was quite forgot 
But calling the attendants went to dine
At Maddalo yet neither cheer nor wine
Could give us spirits for we talked of him
And nothing else till daylight made stars dim
And we agreed his was some dreadful ill 
Wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable
By a dear friend some deadly change in love
Of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of
For whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot
Of falsehood on his mind which flourished not 
But in the light of all-beholding truth
And having stamped this canker on his youth
She had abandoned him and how much more
Might be his woe we guessed not he had store
Of friends and fortune once as we could guess 
From his nice habits and his gentleness
These were now lostit were a grief indeed
If he had changed one unsustaining reed
For all that such a man might else adorn
The colours of his mind seemed yet unworn 
For the wild language of his grief was high
Such as in measure were called poetry
And I remember one remark which then
Maddalo made He said 'Most wretched men
Are cradled into poetry by wrong 
They learn in suffering what they teach in song
If I had been an unconnected man
I from this moment should have formed some plan
Never to leave sweet Venice for to me
It was delight to ride by the lone sea 
And then the town is silent one may write
Or read in gondolas by day or night
Having the little brazen lamp alight
Unseen uninterrupted books are there
Pictures and casts from all those statues fair 
Which were twin-born with poetry and all
We seek in towns with little to recall
Regrets for the green country I might sit
In Maddalo great palace and his wit
And subtle talk would cheer the winter night 
And make me know myself and the firelight
Would flash upon our faces till the day
Might dawn and make me wonder at my stay
But I had friends in London too the chief
Attraction here was that I sought relief 
From the deep tenderness that maniac wrought
Within me 'twas perhaps an idle thought 
But I imagined that if day by day
I watched him and but seldom went away
And studied all the beatings of his heart 
With zeal as men study some stubborn art
For their own good and could by patience find
An entrance to the caverns of his mind
I might reclaim him from this dark estate
In friendships I had been most fortunate  
Yet never saw I one whom I would call
More willingly my friend and this was all
Accomplished not such dreams of baseless good
Oft come and go in crowds or solitude
And leave no trace but what I now designed 
Made for long years impression on my mind
The following morning urged by my affairs
I left bright Venice After many years
And many changes I returned the name
Of Venice and its aspect was the same 
But Maddalo was travelling far away
Among the mountains of Armenia
His dog was dead His child had now become
A woman such as it has been my doom
To meet with few a wonder of this earth 
Where there is little of transcendent worth
Like one of Shakespeare women kindly she
And with a manner beyond courtesy
Received her father friend and when I asked
Of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked 
And told as she had heard the mournful tale
'That the poor sufferer health began to fail
Two years from my departure but that then
The lady who had left him came again
Her mien had been imperious but she now 
Looked meek perhaps remorse had brought her low
Her coming made him better and they stayed
Together at my father for I played
As I remember with the lady shawl 
I might be six years old but after all 
She left him''Why her heart must have been tough
How did it end' 'And was not this enough
They met they parted' 'Child is there no more
'Something within that interval which bore
The stamp of WHY they parted HOW they met 
Yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet
Those wrinkled cheeks with youth remembered tears
Ask me no more but let the silent years
Be closed and cered over their memory
As yon mute marble where their corpses lie' 
I urged and questioned still she told me how
All happened but the cold world shall not know
Far from my dearest Friend 'tis mine to rove
Through bare grey dell high wood and pastoral cove
Where Derwent rests and listens to the roar
That stuns the tremulous cliffs of high Lodore 
Where peace to Grasmere lonely island leads 
To willowy hedge-rows and to emerald meads
Leads to her bridge rude church and cottaged grounds
Her rocky sheepwalks and her woodland bounds
Where undisturbed by winds Winander C sleeps 
'Mid clustering isles and holly-sprinkled steeps 
Where twilight glens endear my Esthwaite shore
And memory of departed pleasures more
Fair scenes erewhile I taught a happy child
The echoes of your rocks my carols wild
The spirit sought not then in cherished sadness 
A cloudy substitute for failing gladness 
In youth keen eye the livelong day was bright
The sun at morning and the stars at night
Alike when first the bittern hollow bill
Was heard or woodcocks D roamed the moonlight hill 
In thoughtless gaiety I coursed the plain 
And hope itself was all I knew of pain
For then the inexperienced heart would beat 
At times while young Content forsook her seat
And wild Impatience pointing upward showed 
Through passes yet unreached a brighter road 
Alas the idle tale of man is found
Depicted in the dial moral round
Hope with reflection blends her social rays 
To gild the total tablet of his days 
Yet still the sport of some malignant power
He knows but from its shade the present hour
But why ungrateful dwell on idle pain
To show what pleasures yet to me remain 
Say will my Friend with unreluctant ear 
The history of a poet evening hear
When in the south the wan noon brooding still
Breathed a pale steam around the glaring hill
And shades of deep-embattled clouds were seen 
Spotting the northern cliffs with lights between
When crowding cattle checked by rails that make
A fence far stretched into the shallow lake
Lashed the cool water with their restless tails
Or from high points of rock looked out for fanning gales 
When school-boys stretched their length upon the green
And round the broad-spread oak a glimmering scene
In the rough fern-clad park the herded deer 
Shook the still-twinkling tail and glancing ear
When horses in the sunburnt intake E stood 
And vainly eyed below the tempting flood
Or tracked the passenger in mute distress
With forward neck the closing gate to press 
Then while I wandered where the huddling rill
Brightens with water-breaks the hollow ghyll F 
As by enchantment an obscure retreat 
Opened at once and stayed my devious feet
While thick above the rill the branches close
In rocky basin its wild waves repose
Inverted shrubs G and moss of gloomy green 
Cling from the rocks with pale wood-weeds between
And its own twilight softens the whole scene H
Save where aloft the subtle sunbeams shine
On withered briars that o'er the crags recline 
Save where with sparkling foam a small cascade 
Illumines from within the leafy shade 
Beyond along the vista of the brook
Where antique roots its bustling course o'erlook
The eye reposes on a secret bridge J
Half grey half shagged with ivy to its ridge 
There bending o'er the stream the listless swain
Lingers behind his disappearing wain 
 Did Sabine grace adorn my living line
Blandusia praise wild stream should yield to thine
Never shall ruthless minister of death 
'Mid thy soft glooms the glittering steel unsheath
No goblets shall for thee be crowned with flowers
No kid with piteous outcry thrill thy bowers
The mystic shapes that by thy margin rove
A more benignant sacrifice approve  
A mind that in a calm angelic mood
Of happy wisdom meditating good
Beholds of all from her high powers required
Much done and much designed and more desired 
Harmonious thoughts a soul by truth refined 
Entire affection for all human kind
Dear Brook farewell To-morrow noon again
Shall hide me wooing long thy wildwood strain
But now the sun has gained his western road
And eve mild hour invites my steps abroad 
While near the midway cliff the silvered kite
In many a whistling circle wheels her flight
Slant watery lights from parting clouds apace
Travel along the precipice base
Cheering its naked waste of scattered stone 
By lichens grey and scanty moss o'ergrown
Where scarce the foxglove peeps or thistle beard
And restless stone-chat all day long is heard
How pleasant as the sun declines to view 
The spacious landscape change in form and hue 
Here vanish as in mist before a flood
Of bright obscurity hill lawn and wood
There objects by the searching beams betrayed
Come forth and here retire in purple shade
Even the white stems of birch the cottage white 
Soften their glare before the mellow light
The skiffs at anchor where with umbrage wide
Yon chestnuts half the latticed boat-house hide
Shed from their sides that face the sun slant beam
Strong flakes of radiance on the tremulous stream 
Raised by yon travelling flock a dusty cloud
Mounts from the road and spreads its moving shroud
The shepherd all involved in wreaths of fire
Now shows a shadowy speck and now is lost entire
Into a gradual calm the breezes sink 
A blue rim borders all the lake still brink
There doth the twinkling aspen foliage sleep
And insects clothe like dust the glassy deep 
And now on every side the surface breaks
Into blue spots and slowly lengthening streaks 
Here plots of sparkling water tremble bright
With thousand thousand twinkling points of light
There waves that hardly weltering die away
Tip their smooth ridges with a softer ray
And now the whole wide lake in deep repose 
Is hushed and like a burnished mirror glows 
Save where along the shady western marge
Coasts with industrious oar the charcoal barge 
Their panniered train a group of potters goad
Winding from side to side up the steep road 
The peasant from yon cliff of fearful edge
Shot down the headlong path darts with his sledge 
Bright beams the lonely mountain-horse illume
Feeding 'mid purple heath green rings K and broom
While the sharp slope the slackened team confounds 
Downward L the ponderous timber-wain resounds
 In foamy breaks the rill with merry song
Dashed o'er the rough rock lightly leaps along
From lonesome chapel at the mountain feet
Three humble bells their rustic chime repeat 
Sounds from the water-side the hammered boat
And 'blasted' quarry thunders heard remote
Even here amid the sweep of endless woods
Blue pomp of lakes high cliffs and falling floods
Not undelightful are the simplest charms 
Found by the grassy door of mountain-farms
Sweetly ferocious M round his native walks
Pride of his sister-wives the monarch stalks
Spur-clad his nervous feet and firm his tread
A crest of purple tops the warrior head 
Bright sparks his black and rolling eye-ball hurls
Afar his tail he closes and unfurls
 On tiptoe reared he strains his clarion throat
Threatened by faintly-answering farms remote
Again with his shrill voice the mountain rings 
While flapped with conscious pride resound his wings 
Where mixed with graceful birch the sombrous pine
And yew-tree o'er the silver rocks recline
I love to mark the quarry moving trains
Dwarf panniered steeds and men and numerous wains 
How busy all the enormous hive within
While Echo dallies with its various din
Some hear you not their chisels' clinking sound 
Toil small as pigmies in the gulf profound
Some dim between the lofty cliffs descried 
O'erwalk the slender plank from side to side
These by the pale-blue rocks that ceaseless ring
In airy baskets hanging work and sing
Just where a cloud above the mountain rears 
An edge all flame the broadening sun appears 
A long blue bar its aegis orb divides
And breaks the spreading of its golden tides
And now that orb has touched the purple steep
Whose softened image penetrates the deep
'Cross the calm lake blue shades the cliffs aspire 
With towers and woods a prospect all on fire N
While coves and secret hollows through a ray
Of fainter gold a purple gleam betray
Each slip of lawn the broken rocks between
Shines in the light with more than earthly green 
Deep yellow beams the scattered stems illume
Far in the level forest central gloom
Waving his hat the shepherd from the vale
Directs his winding dog the cliffs to scale 
The dog loud barking 'mid the glittering rocks 
Hunts where his master points the intercepted flocks 
Where oaks o'erhang the road the radiance shoots
On tawny earth wild weeds and twisted roots
The druid-stones a brightened ring unfold 
And all the babbling brooks are liquid gold 
Sunk to a curve the day-star lessens still
Gives one bright glance and drops behind the hill P
In these secluded vales if village fame
Confirmed by hoary hairs belief may claim
When up the hills as now retired the light 
Strange apparitions mocked the shepherd sight 
The form appears of one that spurs his steed
Midway along the hill with desperate speed 
Unhurt pursues his lengthened flight while all
Attend at every stretch his headlong fall 
Anon appears a brave a gorgeous show
Of horsemen-shadows moving to and fro 
At intervals imperial banners stream 
And now the van reflects the solar beam 
The rear through iron brown betrays a sullen gleam 
While silent stands the admiring crowd below
Silent the visionary warriors go
Winding in ordered pomp their upward way Q
Till the last banner of their long array
Has disappeared and every trace is fled 
Of splendour save the beacon spiry head
Tipt with eve latest gleam of burning red 
Now while the solemn evening shadows sail
On slowly-waving pinions down the vale
And fronting the bright west yon oak entwines 
Its darkening boughs and leaves in stronger lines 
'Tis pleasant near the tranquil lake to stray 
Where winding on along some secret bay 
The swan uplifts his chest and backward flings
His neck a varying arch between his towering wings 
The eye that marks the gliding creature sees
How graceful pride can be and how majestic ease 
While tender cares and mild domestic loves
With furtive watch pursue her as she moves
The female with a meeker charm succeeds 
And her brown little-ones around her leads
Nibbling the water lilies as they pass
Or playing wanton with the floating grass
She in a mother care her beauty pride
Forgetting calls the wearied to her side 
Alternately they mount her back and rest
Close by her mantling wings' embraces prest R
Long may they float upon this flood serene
Theirs be these holms untrodden still and green
Where leafy shades fence off the blustering gale 
And breathes in peace the lily of the vale
Yon isle which feels not even the milk-maid feet
Yet hears her song by distance made more sweet S
Yon isle conceals their home their hut-like bower
Green water-rushes overspread the floor 
Long grass and willows form the woven wall
And swings above the roof the poplar tall
Thence issuing often with unwieldy stalk
They crush with broad black feet their flowery walk 
Or from the neighbouring water hear at morn 
The hound the horse tread and mellow horn
Involve their serpent-necks in changeful rings
Rolled wantonly between their slippery wings
Or starting up with noise and rude delight
Force half upon the wave their cumbrous flight 
Fair Swan by all a mother joys caressed
Haply some wretch has eyed and called thee blessed
When with her infants from some shady seat
By the lake edge she rose to face the noontide heat
Or taught their limbs along the dusty road 
A few short steps to totter with their load 
I see her now denied to lay her head
On cold blue nights in hut or straw-built shed
Turn to a silent smile their sleepy cry
By pointing to the gliding moon on high 
  When low-hung clouds each star of summer hide
And fireless are the valleys far and wide
Where the brook brawls along the public road
Dark with bat-haunted ashes stretching broad
 Oft has she taught them on her lap to lay 
The shining glow-worm or in heedless play
Toss it from hand to hand disquieted
While others not unseen are free to shed
Green unmolested light upon their mossy bed 
Oh when the sleety showers her path assail 
And like a torrent roars the headstrong gale 
No more her breath can thaw their fingers cold
Their frozen arms her neck no more can fold
 Weak roof a cowering form two babes to shield
And faint the fire a dying heart can yield 
Press the sad kiss fond mother vainly fears
Thy flooded cheek to wet them with its tears
 No tears can chill them and no bosom warms
Thy breast their death-bed coffined in thine arms
Sweet are the sounds that mingle from afar 
Heard by calm lakes as peeps the folding star
Where the duck dabbles 'mid the rustling sedge
And feeding pike starts from the water edge
Or the swan stirs the reeds his neck and bill
Wetting that drip upon the water still 
And heron as resounds the trodden shore
Shoots upward darting his long neck before
Now with religious awe the farewell light
Blends with the solemn colouring of night 
'Mid groves of clouds that crest the mountain brow 
And round the west proud lodge their shadows throw
Like Una T shining on her gloomy way
The half-seen form of Twilight roams astray
Shedding through paly loop-holes mild and small
Gleams that upon the lake still bosom fall 
 Soft o'er the surface creep those lustres pale
Tracking the motions of the fitful gale 
With restless interchange at once the bright
Wins on the shade the shade upon the light
No favoured eye was e'er allowed to gaze 
On lovelier spectacle in faery days
When gentle Spirits urged a sportive chase
Brushing with lucid wands the water face
While music stealing round the glimmering deeps
Charmed the tall circle of the enchanted steeps 
 The lights are vanished from the watery plains
No wreck of all the pageantry remains
Unheeded night has overcome the vales
On the dark earth the wearied vision fails
The latest lingerer of the forest train 
The lone black fir forsakes the faded plain
Last evening sight the cottage smoke no more
Lost in the thickened darkness glimmers hoar
And towering from the sullen dark-brown mere
Like a black wall the mountain-steeps appear 
 Now o'er the soothed accordant heart we feel
A sympathetic twilight slowly steal
And ever as we fondly muse we find
The soft gloom deepening on the tranquil mind
Stay pensive sadly-pleasing visions stay 
Ah no as fades the vale they fade away
Yet still the tender vacant gloom remains
Still the cold cheek its shuddering tear retains
The bird who ceased with fading light to thread
Silent the hedge or steamy rivulet bed 
From his grey re-appearing tower shall soon
Salute with gladsome note the rising moon
While with a hoary light she frosts the ground
And pours a deeper blue to Aether bound
Pleased as she moves her pomp of clouds to fold 
In robes of azure fleecy-white and gold 
Above yon eastern hill where darkness broods
O'er all its vanished dells and lawns and woods
Where but a mass of shade the sight can trace
Even now she shows half-veiled her lovely face 
Across the gloomy valley flings her light
Far to the western slopes with hamlets white
And gives where woods the chequered upland strew
To the green corn of summer autumn hue
Thus Hope first pouring from her blessed horn 
Her dawn far lovelier than the moon own morn
'Till higher mounted strives in vain to cheer
The weary hills impervious blackening near
Yet does she still undaunted throw the while
On darling spots remote her tempting smile 
Even now she decks for me a distant scene
For dark and broad the gulf of time between
Gilding that cottage with her fondest ray
Sole bourn sole wish sole object of my way 
How fair its lawns and sheltering woods appear
How sweet its streamlet murmurs in mine ear
Where we my Friend to happy days shall rise
'Till our small share of hardly-paining sighs
For sighs will ever trouble human breath 
Creep hushed into the tranquil breast of death
But now the clear bright Moon her zenith gains
And rimy without speck extend the plains
The deepest cleft the mountain front displays 
Scarce hides a shadow from her searching rays 
From the dark-blue faint silvery threads divide
The hills while gleams below the azure tide
Time softly treads throughout the landscape breathes
A peace enlivened not disturbed by wreaths
Of charcoal-smoke that o'er the fallen wood 
Steal down the hill and spread along the flood
The song of mountain-streams unheard by day
Now hardly heard beguiles my homeward way U
Air listens like the sleeping water still
To catch the spiritual music of the hill 
Broke only by the slow clock tolling deep
Or shout that wakes the ferry-man from sleep
The echoed hoof nearing the distant shore
The boat first motion made with dashing oar 
Sound of closed gate across the water borne 
Hurrying the timid hare through rustling corn
The sportive outcry of the mocking owl 
And at long intervals the mill-dog howl
The distant forge swinging thump profound
Or yell in the deep woods of lonely hound 
Were there below a spot of holy ground
Where from distress a refuge might be found
And solitude prepare the soul for heaven
Sure nature God that spot to man had given 
Where falls the purple morning far and wide 
In flakes of light upon the mountain-side
Where with loud voice the power of water shakes 
The leafy wood or sleeps in quiet lakes
Yet not unrecompensed the man shall roam
Who at the call of summer quits his home 
And plods through some wide realm o'er vale and height
Though seeking only holiday delight 
At least not owning to himself an aim
To which the sage would give a prouder name 
No gains too cheaply earned his fancy cloy 
Though every passing zephyr whispers joy
Brisk toil alternating with ready ease
Feeds the clear current of his sympathies 
For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn
And peeps the far-off spire his evening bourn 
Dear is the forest frowning o'er his head
And dear the velvet green-sward to his tread 
Moves there a cloud o'er mid-day flaming eye
Upward he looks and calls it luxury E
Kind Nature charities his steps attend 
In every babbling brook he finds a friend
While chastening thoughts of sweetest use bestowed
By wisdom moralise his pensive road
Host of his welcome inn the noon-tide bower
To his spare meal he calls the passing poor 
He views the sun uplift his golden fire
Or sink with heart alive like Memnon lyre F
Blesses the moon that comes with kindly ray
To light him shaken by his rugged way 
Back from his sight no bashful children steal 
He sits a brother at the cottage-meal 
His humble looks no shy restraint impart
Around him plays at will the virgin heart
While unsuspended wheels the village dance
The maidens eye him with enquiring glance 
Much wondering by what fit of crazing care
Or desperate love bewildered he came there 
A hope that prudence could not then approve
That clung to Nature with a truant love
O'er Gallia wastes of corn my footsteps led 
Her files of road-elms high above my head
In long-drawn vista rustling in the breeze
Or where her pathways straggle as they please
By lonely farms and secret villages
But lo the Alps ascending white in air 
Toy with the sun and glitter from afar
And now emerging from the forest gloom
I greet thee Chartreuse while I mourn thy doom
Whither is fled that Power whose frown severe
Awed sober Reason till she crouched in fear 
That Silence once in deathlike fetters bound
Chains that were loosened only by the sound
Of holy rites chanted in measured round 
 The voice of blasphemy the fane alarms
The cloister startles at the gleam of arms 
The thundering tube the aged angler hears G
Bent o'er the groaning flood that sweeps away his tears 
Cloud-piercing pine-trees nod their troubled heads 
Spires rocks and lawns a browner night o'erspreads
Strong terror checks the female peasant sighs 
And start the astonished shades at female eyes
From Bruno forest screams the affrighted jay
And slow the insulted eagle wheels away
A viewless flight of laughing Demons mock
The Cross by angels planted H on the aerial rock 
The parting Genius J sighs with hollow breath
Along the mystic streams of Life and DeathK
Swelling the outcry dull that long resounds
Portentous through her old woods' trackless bounds
Vallombre L 'mid her falling fanes deplores 
For ever broke the sabbath of her bowers
More pleased my foot the hidden margin roves
Of Como bosomed deep in chestnut groves
No meadows thrown between the giddy steeps
Tower bare or sylvan from the narrow deeps 
 To towns whose shades of no rude noise complain
From ringing team apart and grating wain 
To flat-roofed towns that touch the water bound
Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound
Or from the bending rocks obtrusive cling 
And o'er the whitened wave their shadows fling 
The pathway leads as round the steeps it twines 
And Silence loves its purple roof of vines
The loitering traveller hence at evening sees
From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees 
Or marks 'mid opening cliffs fair dark-eyed maids
Tend the small harvest of their garden glades
Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view
Stretch o'er the pictured mirror broad and blue
And track the yellow lights from steep to steep 
As up the opposing hills they slowly creep 
Aloft here half a village shines arrayed
In golden light half hides itself in shade
While from amid the darkened roofs the spire
Restlessly flashing seems to mount like fire 
There all unshaded blazing forests throw
Rich golden verdure on the lake below
Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore
And steals into the shade the lazy oar
Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs 
And amorous music on the water dies
How blest delicious scene the eye that greets
Thy open beauties or thy lone retreats
Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales
Thy cliffs the endless waters of thy vales 
Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore 
Each with its household boat beside the door
 Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky
Thy towns that cleave like swallows' nests on high 
That glimmer hoar in eve last light descried 
Dim from the twilight water shaggy side
Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted woods
Steal and compose the oar-forgotten floods
 Thy lake that streaked or dappled blue or grey
'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning ray 
Slow-travelling down the western hills to' enfold 
Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold
Thy glittering steeples whence the matin bell
Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell
And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass 
Along the steaming lake to early mass 
But now farewell to each and all adieu
To every charm and last and chief to you 
Ye lovely maidens that in noontide shade
Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade 
To all that binds the soul in powerless trance
Lip-dewing song and ringlet-tossing dance
Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume
The sylvan cabin lute-enlivened gloom
 Alas the very murmur of the streams 
Breathes o'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams
While Slavery forcing the sunk mind to dwell
On joys that might disgrace the captive cell
Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como marge
And lures from bay to bay the vocal barge 
Yet are thy softer arts with power indued
To soothe and cheer the poor man solitude
By silent cottage-doors the peasant home
Left vacant for the day I loved to roam 
But once I pierced the mazes of a wood 
In which a cabin undeserted stood 
There an old man an olden measure scanned
On a rude viol touched with withered hand 
As lambs or fawns in April clustering lie 
Under a hoary oak thin canopy 
Stretched at his feet with stedfast upward eye
His children children listened to the sound 
 A Hermit with his family around
But let us hence for fair Locarno smiles
Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles 
Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa stream
Where 'mid dim towers and woods her M waters gleam
From the bright wave in solemn gloom retire
The dull-red steeps and darkening still aspire
To where afar rich orange lustres glow 
Round undistinguished clouds and rocks and snow
Or led where Via Mala chasms confine
The indignant waters of the infant Rhine
Hang o'er the abyss whose else impervious gloom 
His burning eyes with fearful light illume 
The mind condemned without reprieve to go
O'er life long deserts with its charge of woe
With sad congratulation joins the train
Where beasts and men together o'er the plain
Move on a mighty caravan of pain 
Hope strength and courage social suffering brings
Freshening the wilderness with shades and springs
 There be whose lot far otherwise is cast
Sole human tenant of the piny waste 
By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here 
A nursling babe her only comforter
Lo where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock
A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke 
When lightning among clouds and mountain-snows
Predominates and darkness comes and goes 
And the fierce torrent at the flashes broad
Starts like a horse beside the glaring road 
She seeks a covert from the battering shower
In the roofed bridge N the bridge in that dread hour
Itself all trembling at the torrent power 
Nor is she more at ease on some still night
When not a star supplies the comfort of its light
Only the waning moon hangs dull and red
Above a melancholy mountain head
Then sets In total gloom the Vagrant sighs 
Stoops her sick head and shuts her weary eyes
Or on her fingers counts the distant clock
Or to the drowsy crow of midnight cock
Listens or quakes while from the forest gulf
Howls near and nearer yet the famished wolf 
From the green vale of Urseren smooth and wide
Descend we now the maddened Reuss our guide 
By rocks that shutting out the blessed day
Cling tremblingly to rocks as loose as they
By cells P upon whose image while he prays 
The kneeling peasant scarcely dares to gaze
By many a votive death-cross Q planted near
And watered duly with the pious tear
That faded silent from the upward eye
Unmoved with each rude form of peril nigh 
Fixed on the anchor left by Him who saves
Alike in whelming snows and roaring waves
But soon a peopled region on the sight
Opens a little world of calm delight 
Where mists suspended on the expiring gale 
Spread roof like o'er the deep secluded vale 
And beams of evening slipping in between
Gently illuminate a sober scene 
Here on the brown wood-cottages R they sleep 
There over rock or sloping pasture creep 
On as we journey in clear view displayed
The still vale lengthens underneath its shade
Of low-hung vapour on the freshened mead
The green light sparkles the dim bowers recede 
While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull 
And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull
In solemn shapes before the admiring eye
Dilated hang the misty pines on high
Huge convent domes with pinnacles and towers
And antique castles seen through gleamy showers 
From such romantic dreams my soul awake
To sterner pleasure where by Uri lake
In Nature pristine majesty outspread
Winds neither road nor path for foot to tread 
The rocks rise naked as a wall or stretch 
Far o'er the water hung with groves of beech 
Aerial pines from loftier steeps ascend
Nor stop but where creation seems to end 
Yet here and there if 'mid the savage scene
Appears a scanty plot of smiling green 
Up from the lake a zigzag path will creep
To reach a small wood-hut hung boldly on the steep 
 Before those thresholds never can they know 
The face of traveller passing to and fro
No peasant leans upon his pole to tell 
For whom at morning tolled the funeral bell
Their watch-dog ne'er his angry bark foregoes
Touched by the beggar moan of human woes
The shady porch ne'er offered a cool seat
To pilgrims overcome by summer heat 
Yet thither the world business finds its way
At times and tales unsought beguile the day
And there are those fond thoughts which Solitude 
However stern is powerless to exclude 
There doth the maiden watch her lover sail 
Approaching and upbraid the tardy gale
At midnight listens till his parting oar
And its last echo can be heard no more 
And what if ospreys cormorants herons cry
Amid tempestuous vapours driving by 
Or hovering over wastes too bleak to rear
That common growth of earth the foodful ear 
Where the green apple shrivels on the spray
And pines the unripened pear in summer kindliest ray 
Contentment shares the desolate domain 
With Independence child of high Disdain
Exulting 'mid the winter of the skies
Shy as the jealous chamois Freedom flies
And grasps by fits her sword and often eyes
And sometimes as from rock to rock she bounds 
The Patriot nymph starts at imagined sounds
And wildly pausing oft she hangs aghast
Whether some old Swiss air hath checked her haste
Or thrill of Spartan fife is caught between the blast 
Swoln with incessant rains from hour to hour 
All day the floods a deepening murmur pour
The sky is veiled and every cheerful sight
Dark is the region as with coming night
But what a sudden burst of overpowering light
Triumphant on the bosom of the storm 
Glances the wheeling eagle glorious form
Eastward in long perspective glittering shine
The wood-crowned cliffs that o'er the lake recline
Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold 
At once to pillars turned that flame with gold 
Behind his sail the peasant shrinks to shun
The west that burns like one dilated sun
A crucible of mighty compass felt
By mountains glowing till they seem to melt 
But lo the boatman overawed before 
The pictured fane of Tell suspends his oar
Confused the Marathonian tale appears
While his eyes sparkle with heroic tears 
And who that walks where men of ancient days
Have wrought with godlike arm the deeds of praise 
Feels not the spirit of the place control
Or rouse and agitate his labouring soul
Say who by thinking on Canadian hills
Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills
On Zutphen plain or on that highland dell 
Through which rough Garry cleaves his way can tell
What high resolves exalt the tenderest thought
Of him whom passion rivets to the spot 
Where breathed the gale that caught Wolfe happiest sigh
And the last sunbeam fell on Bayard eye 
Where bleeding Sidney from the cup retired
And glad Dundee in faint huzzas S expired
But now with other mind I stand alone
Upon the summit of this naked cone
And watch the fearless chamois-hunter chase 
His prey through tracts abrupt of desolate space 
T Through vacant worlds where Nature never gave
A brook to murmur or a bough to wave
Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep
Thro' worlds where Life and Voice and Motion sleep 
Where silent Hours their death-like sway extend
Save when the avalanche breaks loose to rend
Its way with uproar till the ruin drowned
In some dense wood or gulf of snow profound
Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound 
 'Tis his while wandering on from height to height
To see a planet pomp and steady light
In the least star of scarce-appearing night
While the pale moon moves near him on the bound
Of ether shining with diminished round 
And far and wide the icy summits blaze
Rejoicing in the glory of her rays
To him the day-star glitters small and bright
Shorn of its beams insufferably white
And he can look beyond the sun and view 
Those fast-receding depths of sable blue
Flying till vision can no more pursue 
 At once bewildering mists around him close
And cold and hunger are his least of woes
The Demon of the snow with angry roar 
Descending shuts for aye his prison door
Soon with despair whole weight his spirits sink
Bread has he none the snow must be his drink
And ere his eyes can close upon the day 
The eagle of the Alps o'ershades her prey 
Now couch thyself where heard with fear afar 
Thunders through echoing pines the headlong Aar
Or rather stay to taste the mild delights
Of pensive Underwalden U pastoral heights
 Is there who 'mid these awful wilds has seen 
The native Genii walk the mountain green
Or heard while other worlds their charms reveal
Soft music o'er the aerial summit steal
While o'er the desert answering every close
Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes 
 And sure there is a secret Power that reigns
Here where no trace of man the spot profanes
Nought but the chalets V flat and bare on high
Suspended 'mid the quiet of the sky
Or distant herds that pasturing upward creep 
And not untended climb the dangerous steep 
How still no irreligious sound or sight
Rouses the soul from her severe delight
An idle voice the sabbath region fills
Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills 
And with that voice accords the soothing sound 
Of drowsy bells for ever tinkling round
Faint wail of eagle melting into blue
Beneath the cliffs and pine-woods' steady sugh W
The solitary heifer deepened low 
Or rumbling heard remote of falling snow
All motions sounds and voices far and nigh
Blend in a music of tranquillity 
Save when a stranger seen below the boy
Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy 
When from the sunny breast of open seas
And bays with myrtle fringed the southern breeze
Comes on to gladden April with the sight
Of green isles widening on each snow-clad height 
When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill 
And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill
 The pastoral Swiss begin the cliffs to scale
Leaving to silence the deserted vale 
And like the Patriarchs in their simple age
Move as the verdure leads from stage to stage 
High and more high in summer heat they go 
And hear the rattling thunder far below
Or steal beneath the mountains half-deterred
Where huge rocks tremble to the bellowing herd 
One I behold who 'cross the foaming flood 
Leaps with a bound of graceful hardihood
Another high on that green ledge he gained
The tempting spot with every sinew strained 
And downward thence a knot of grass he throws
Food for his beasts in time of winter snows 
 Far different life from what Tradition hoar
Transmits of happier lot in times of yore 
Then Summer lingered long and honey flowed
From out the rocks the wild bees' safe abode 
Continual waters welling cheered the waste 
And plants were wholesome now of deadly taste
Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had piled
Usurping where the fairest herbage smiled
Nor Hunger driven the herds from pastures bare
To climb the treacherous cliffs for scanty fare 
Then the milk-thistle flourished through the land
And forced the full-swoln udder to demand
Thrice every day the pail and welcome hand 
Thus does the father to his children tell
Of banished bliss by fancy loved too well 
Alas that human guilt provoked the rod 
Of angry Nature to avenge her God
Still Nature ever just to him imparts
Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts
'Tis morn with gold the verdant mountain glows 
More high the snowy peaks with hues of rose
Far-stretched beneath the many-tinted hills
A mighty waste of mist the valley fills
A solemn sea whose billows wide around 
Stand motionless to awful silence bound 
Pines on the coast through mist their tops uprear
That like to leaning masts of stranded ships appear
A single chasm a gulf of gloomy blue
Gapes in the centre of the sea and through
That dark mysterious gulf ascending sound 
Innumerable streams with roar profound 
Mount through the nearer vapours notes of birds
And merry flageolet the low of herds
The bark of dogs the heifer tinkling bell
Talk laughter and perchance a church-tower knell 
Think not the peasant from aloft has gazed
And heard with heart unmoved with soul unraised 
Nor is his spirit less enrapt nor less
Alive to independent happiness 
Then when he lies out-stretched at even-tide 
Upon the fragrant mountain purple side 
For as the pleasures of his simple day
Beyond his native valley seldom stray
Nought round its darling precincts can he find
But brings some past enjoyment to his mind 
While Hope reclining upon Pleasure urn 
Binds her wild wreaths and whispers his return
Once Man entirely free alone and wild
Was blest as free for he was Nature child
He all superior but his God disdained 
Walked none restraining and by none restrained
Confessed no law but what his reason taught
Did all he wished and wished but what he ought
As man in his primeval dower arrayed
The image of his glorious Sire displayed 
Even so by faithful Nature guarded here
The traces of primeval Man appear
The simple dignity no forms debase
The eye sublime and surly lion-grace
The slave of none of beasts alone the lord 
His book he prizes nor neglects his sword 
 Well taught by that to feel his rights prepared
With this the blessings he enjoys to guard X
And as his native hills encircle ground
For many a marvellous victory renowned 
The work of Freedom daring to oppose
With few in arms Y innumerable foes
When to those famous fields his steps are led
An unknown power connects him with the dead
For images of other worlds are there 
Awful the light and holy is the air
Fitfully and in flashes through his soul
Like sun-lit tempests troubled transports roll
His bosom heaves his Spirit towers amain 
Beyond the senses and their little reign 
And oft when that dread vision hath past by 
He holds with God himself communion high
There where the peal of swelling torrents fills
The sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills
Or when upon the mountain silent brow 
Reclined he sees above him and below
Bright stars of ice and azure fields of snow
While needle peaks of granite shooting bare
Tremble in ever-varying tints of air
And when a gathering weight of shadows brown 
Falls on the valleys as the sun goes down
And Pikes of darkness named and fear and storms Z
Uplift in quiet their illumined forms 
In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread
Tinged like an angel smile all rosy red  
Awe in his breast with holiest love unites
And the near heavens impart their own delights 
When downward to his winter hut he goes
Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows
That hut which on the hills so oft employs 
His thoughts the central point of all his joys 
And as a swallow at the hour of rest
Peeps often ere she darts into her nest
So to the homestead where the grandsire tends
A little prattling child he oft descends 
To glance a look upon the well-matched pair 
Till storm and driving ice blockade him there
There safely guarded by the woods behind
He hears the chiding of the baffled wind
Hears Winter calling all his terrors round 
And blest within himself he shrinks not from the sound 
Through Nature vale his homely pleasures glide
Unstained by envy discontent and pride
The bound of all his vanity to deck
With one bright bell a favourite heifer neck 
Well pleased upon some simple annual feast
Remembered half the year and hoped the rest
If dairy-produce from his inner hoard
Of thrice ten summers dignify the board
 Alas in every clime a flying ray 
Is all we have to cheer our wintry way
And here the unwilling mind may more than trace
The general sorrows of the human race
The churlish gales of penury that blow
Cold as the north-wind o'er a waste of snow 
To them the gentle groups of bliss deny
That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie
Yet more compelled by Powers which only deign
That solitary man disturb their reign
Powers that support an unremitting strife 
With all the tender charities of life
Full oft the father when his sons have grown
To manhood seems their title to disown 
And from his nest amid the storms of heaven
Drives eagle-like those sons as he was driven 
With stern composure watches to the plain 
And never eagle-like beholds again
When long familiar joys are all resigned
Why does their sad remembrance haunt the mind 
Lo where through flat Batavia willowy groves 
Or by the lazy Seine the exile roves
O'er the curled waters Alpine measures swell
And search the affections to their inmost cell
Sweet poison spreads along the listener veins
Turning past pleasures into mortal pains 
Poison which not a frame of steel can brave
Bows his young head with sorrow to the grave Aa
Gay lark of hope thy silent song resume
Ye flattering eastern lights once more the hills illume 
Fresh gales and dews of life delicious morn 
And thou lost fragrance of the heart return
Alas the little joy to man allowed
Fades like the lustre of an evening cloud 
Or like the beauty in a flower installed
Whose season was and cannot be recalled 
Yet when opprest by sickness grief or care
And taught that pain is pleasure natural heir
We still confide in more than we can know
Death would be else the favourite friend of woe 
'Mid savage rocks and seas of snow that shine 
Between interminable tracts of pine
Within a temple stands an awful shrine 
By an uncertain light revealed that falls
On the mute Image and the troubled walls
Oh give not me that eye of hard disdain 
That views undimmed Ensiedlen Bb wretched fane
While ghastly faces through the gloom appear 
Abortive joy and hope that works in fear 
While prayer contends with silenced agony 
Surely in other thoughts contempt may die 
If the sad grave of human ignorance bear
One flower of hope oh pass and leave it there Cc
The tall sun pausing on an Alpine spire
Flings o'er the wilderness a stream of fire
Now meet we other pilgrims ere the day 
Close on the remnant of their weary way
While they are drawing toward the sacred floor
Where so they fondly think the worm shall gnaw no more 
How gaily murmur and how sweetly taste
The fountains Dd reared for them amid the waste 
Their thirst they slake they wash their toil-worn feet
And some with tears of joy each other greet 
Yes I must see you when ye first behold
Those holy turrets tipped with evening gold
In that glad moment will for you a sigh 
Be heaved of charitable sympathy 
In that glad moment when your hands are prest
In mute devotion on the thankful breast
Last let us turn to Chamouny that shields 
With rocks and gloomy woods her fertile fields 
Five streams of ice amid her cots descend
And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend Ee
A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns
Of purple lights and ever-vernal plains
Here all the seasons revel hand in hand 
'Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned 
 They sport beneath that mountain matchless height 
That holds no commerce with the summer night Ee
From age to age throughout his lonely bounds
The crash of ruin fitfully resounds 
Appalling havoc but serene his brow
Where daylight lingers on perpetual snow
Glitter the stars and all is black below Ee
What marvel then if many a Wanderer sigh
While roars the sullen Arve in anger by 
That not for thy reward unrivall'd Vale Ff
Waves the ripe harvest in the autumnal gale
That thou the slave of slaves art doomed to pine
And droop while no Italian arts are thine
To soothe or cheer to soften or refine 
Hail Freedom whether it was mine to stray
With shrill winds whistling round my lonely way 
On the bleak sides of Cumbria heath-clad moors
Or where dank sea-weed lashes Scotland shores
To scent the sweets of Piedmont breathing rose 
And orange gale that o'er Lugano blows
Still have I found where Tyranny prevails
That virtue languishes and pleasure fails 
While the remotest hamlets blessings share
In thy loved presence known and only there 
Heart-blessings outward treasures too which the eye
Of the sun peeping through the clouds can spy
And every passing breeze will testify 
There to the porch belike with jasmine bound
Or woodbine wreaths a smoother path is wound 
The housewife there a brighter garden sees
Where hum on busier wing her happy bees 
On infant cheeks there fresher roses blow
And grey-haired men look up with livelier brow 
To greet the traveller needing food and rest 
Housed for the night or but a half-hour guest 
And oh fair France though now the traveller sees
Thy three-striped banner fluctuate on the breeze
Though martial songs have banished songs of love
And nightingales desert the village grove 
Scared by the fife and rumbling drum alarms
And the short thunder and the flash of arms
That cease not till night falls when far and nigh
Sole sound the Sourd Gg prolongs his mournful cry 
 Yet hast thou found that Freedom spreads her power 
Beyond the cottage-hearth the cottage-door
All nature smiles and owns beneath her eyes
Her fields peculiar and peculiar skies
Yes as I roamed where Loiret waters glide
Through rustling aspens heard from side to side 
When from October clouds a milder light
Fell where the blue flood rippled into white
Methought from every cot the watchful bird
Crowed with ear-piercing power till then unheard
Each clacking mill that broke the murmuring streams 
Rocked the charmed thought in more delightful dreams
Chasing those pleasant dreams the falling leaf
Awoke a fainter sense of moral grief
The measured echo of the distant flail
Wound in more welcome cadence down the vale 
With more majestic course the water rolled
And ripening foliage shone with richer gold 
 But foes are gathering Liberty must raise
Red on the hills her beacon far-seen blaze
Must bid the tocsin ring from tower to tower  
Nearer and nearer comes the trying hour 
Rejoice brave Land though pride perverted ire
Rouse hell own aid and wrap thy fields in fire
Lo from the flames a great and glorious birth
As if a new-made heaven were hailing a new earth 
 All cannot be the promise is too fair
For creatures doomed to breathe terrestrial air
Yet not for this will sober reason frown
Upon that promise not the hope disown
She knows that only from high aims ensue 
Rich guerdons and to them alone are due 
Great God by whom the strifes of men are weighed
In an impartial balance give thine aid
To the just cause and oh do thou preside
Over the mighty stream now spreading wide Hh 
So shall its waters from the heavens supplied
In copious showers from earth by wholesome springs
Brood o'er the long-parched lands with Nile-like wings
And grant that every sceptred child of clay
Who cries presumptuous Here the flood shall stay 
May in its progress see thy guiding hand
And cease the acknowledged purpose to withstand 
Or swept in anger from the insulted shore
Sink with his servile bands to rise no more 
To-night my Friend within this humble cot 
Be scorn and fear and hope alike forgot 
In timely sleep and when at break of day
On the tall peaks the glistening sunbeams play 
With a light heart our course we may renew
The first whose footsteps print the mountain dew 
A traveller on the skirt of Sarum Plain
Pursued his vagrant way with feet half bare
Stooping his gait but not as if to gain
Help from the staff he bore for mien and air
Were hardy though his cheek seemed worn with care 
Both of the time to come and time long fled
Down fell in straggling locks his thin grey hair
A coat he wore of military red
While thus he journeyed step by step led on 
He saw and passed a stately inn full sure
That welcome in such house for him was none
No board inscribed the needy to allure
Hung there no bush proclaimed to old and poor
And desolate Here you will find a friend 
The pendent grapes glittered above the door 
On he must pace perchance 'till night descend
The gathering clouds grew red with stormy fire
In streaks diverging wide and mounting high 
That inn he long had passed the distant spire
Which oft as he looked back had fixed his eye
Was lost though still he looked in the blank sky
Perplexed and comfortless he gazed around
And scarce could any trace of man descry 
Save cornfields stretched and stretching without bound
No tree was there no meadow pleasant green
No brook to wet his lip or soothe his ear
Long files of corn-stacks here and there were seen 
But not one dwelling-place his heart to cheer
Some labourer thought he may perchance be near
And so he sent a feeble shout in vain
No voice made answer he could only hear
Winds rustling over plots of unripe grain 
Long had he fancied each successive slope
Concealed some cottage whither he might turn
And rest but now along heaven darkening cope
The crows rushed by in eddies homeward borne 
Thus warned he sought some shepherd spreading thorn
Or hovel from the storm to shield his head
But sought in vain for now all wild forlorn
And vacant a huge waste around him spread
And be it so for to the chill night shower
And the sharp wind his head he oft hath bared
A Sailor he who many a wretched hour
Hath told for landing after labour hard
Full long endured in hope of just reward 
He to an armed fleet was forced away
By seamen who perhaps themselves had shared
Like fate was hurried off a helpless prey
For years the work of carnage did not cease 
And death dire aspect daily he surveyed
Death minister then came his glad release
And hope returned and pleasure fondly made
Her dwelling in his dreams By Fancy aid
The happy husband flies his arms to throw 
Round his wife neck the prize of victory laid
In her full lap he sees such sweet tears flow
Vain hope for fraud took all that he had earned
The lion roars and gluts his tawny brood 
Even in the desert heart but he returned
Bears not to those he loves their needful food
His home approaching but in such a mood
That from his sight his children might have run
He met a traveller robbed him shed his blood 
And when the miserable work was done
From that day forth no place to him could be
So lonely but that thence might come a pang
Brought from without to inward misery 
Now as he plodded on with sullen clang
A sound of chains along the desert rang
He looked and saw upon a gibbet high
A human body that in irons swang
Uplifted by the tempest whirling by 
It was a spectacle which none might view
In spot so savage but with shuddering pain
Nor only did for him at once renew
All he had feared from man but roused a train 
Of the mind phantoms horrible as vain
The stones as if to cover him from day
Rolled at his back along the living plain
He fell and without sense or motion lay
As one whose brain habitual frensy fires
Owes to the fit in which his soul hath tossed
Profounder quiet when the fit retires
Even so the dire phantasma which had crossed
His sense in sudden vacancy quite lost 
Left his mind still as a deep evening stream
Nor if accosted now in thought engrossed
Moody or inly troubled would he seem
Hurtle the clouds in deeper darkness piled 
Gone is the raven timely rest to seek
He seemed the only creature in the wild
On whom the elements their rage might wreak
Save that the bustard of those regions bleak
Shy tenant seeing by the uncertain light 
A man there wandering gave a mournful shriek
And half upon the ground with strange affright
All all was cheerless to the horizon bound
The weary eye which wheresoe'er it strays 
Marks nothing but the red sun setting round
Or on the earth strange lines in former days
Left by gigantic arms at length surveys
What seems an antique castle spreading wide
Hoary and naked are its walls and raise 
Their brow sublime in shelter there to bide
Pile of Stone-henge so proud to hint yet keep
Thy secrets thou that lov'st to stand and hear
The Plain resounding to the whirlwind sweep 
Inmate of lonesome Nature endless year
Even if thou saw'st the giant wicker rear
For sacrifice its throngs of living men
Before thy face did ever wretch appear
Who in his heart had groaned with deadlier pain 
Within that fabric of mysterious form
Winds met in conflict each by turns supreme
And from the perilous ground dislodged through storm
And rain he wildered on no moon to stream 
From gulf of parting clouds one friendly beam
Nor any friendly sound his footsteps led
Once did the lightning faint disastrous gleam
Disclose a naked guide-post double head
No swinging sign-board creaked from cottage elm
To stay his steps with faintness overcome
'Twas dark and void as ocean watery realm
Roaring with storms beneath night starless gloom
No gipsy cower'd o'er fire of furze or broom 
No labourer watched his red kiln glaring bright
Nor taper glimmered dim from sick man room
Along the waste no line of mournful light
At length though hid in clouds the moon arose 
The downs were visible and now revealed
A structure stands which two bare slopes enclose
It was a spot where ancient vows fulfilled
Kind pious hands did to the Virgin build
A lonely Spital the belated swain 
From the night terrors of that waste to shield
But there no human being could remain
Though he had little cause to love the abode
Of man or covet sight of mortal face 
Yet when faint beams of light that ruin showed
How glad he was at length to find some trace
Of human shelter in that dreary place
Till to his flock the early shepherd goes
Here shall much-needed sleep his frame embrace 
In a dry nook where fern the floor bestrows
When hearing a deep sigh that seemed to come
From one who mourned in sleep he raised his head
And saw a woman in the naked room 
Outstretched and turning on a restless bed
The moon a wan dead light around her shed
He waked her spake in tone that would not fail
He hoped to calm her mind but ill he sped
For of that ruin she had heard a tale 
Had heard of one who forced from storms to shroud
Felt the loose walls of this decayed Retreat
Rock to incessant neighings shrill and loud
While his horse pawed the floor with furious heat 
Till on a stone that sparkled to his feet
Struck and still struck again the troubled horse
The man half raised the stone with pain and sweat
Half raised for well his arm might lose its force
Such tale of this lone mansion she had learned
And when that shape with eyes in sleep half drowned
By the moon sullen lamp she first discerned
Cold stony horror all her senses bound
Her he addressed in words of cheering sound 
Recovering heart like answer did she make
And well it was that of the corse there found
In converse that ensued she nothing spake
But soon his voice and words of kind intent 
Banished that dismal thought and now the wind
In fainter howlings told its rage was spent
Meanwhile discourse ensued of various kind
Which by degrees a confidence of mind
And mutual interest failed not to create 
And to a natural sympathy resigned
In that forsaken building where they sate
By Derwent side my father dwelt a man
Of virtuous life by pious parents bred 
And I believe that soon as I began
To lisp he made me kneel beside my bed
And in his hearing there my prayers I said
And afterwards by my good father taught
I read and loved the books in which I read 
For books in every neighbouring house I sought
A little croft we owned a plot of corn
A garden stored with peas and mint and thyme
And flowers for posies oft on Sunday morn 
Plucked while the church bells rang their earliest chime
Can I forget our freaks at shearing time
My hen rich nest through long grass scarce espied
The cowslip-gathering in June dewy prime
The swans that with white chests upreared in pride 
The staff I well remember which upbore
The bending body of my active sire
His seat beneath the honied sycamore
Where the bees hummed and chair by winter fire 
When market-morning came the neat attire
With which though bent on haste myself I decked
Our watchful house-dog that would tease and tire
The stranger till its barking-fit I checked 
The suns of twenty summers danced along 
Too little marked how fast they rolled away
But through severe mischance and cruel wrong
My father substance fell into decay
We toiled and struggled hoping for a day 
When Fortune might put on a kinder look
But vain were wishes efforts vain as they
He from his old hereditary nook
It was indeed a miserable hour 
When from the last hill-top my sire surveyed
Peering above the trees the steeple tower
That on his marriage day sweet music made
Till then he hoped his bones might there be laid
Close by my mother in their native bowers 
Bidding me trust in God he stood and prayed 
I could not pray through tears that fell in showers
There was a Youth whom I had loved so long
That when I loved him not I cannot say 
'Mid the green mountains many a thoughtless song 
We two had sung like gladsome birds in May
When we began to tire of childish play
We seemed still more and more to prize each other
We talked of marriage and our marriage day 
And I in truth did love him like a brother
Two years were passed since to a distant town
He had repaired to ply a gainful trade 
What tears of bitter grief till then unknown 
What tender vows our last sad kiss delayed
To him we turned we had no other aid
Like one revived upon his neck I wept
And her whom he had loved in joy he said
He well could love in grief his faith he kept 
We lived in peace and comfort and were blest
With daily bread by constant toil supplied 
Three lovely babes had lain upon my breast 
And often viewing their sweet smiles I sighed 
And knew not why My happy father died
When threatened war reduced the children meal
Thrice happy that for him the grave could hide 
The empty loom cold hearth and silent wheel
'Twas a hard change an evil time was come
We had no hope and no relief could gain
But soon with proud parade the noisy drum
Beat round to clear the streets of want and pain
My husband arms now only served to strain 
Me and his children hungering in his view
In such dismay my prayers and tears were vain
To join those miserable men he flew
There were we long neglected and we bore 
Much sorrow ere the fleet its anchor weighed 
Green fields before us and our native shore
We breathed a pestilential air that made
Ravage for which no knell was heard We prayed
For our departure wished and wished nor knew 
'Mid that long sickness and those hopes delayed 
That happier days we never more must view
But the calm summer season now was past 
On as we drove the equinoctial deep 
Ran mountains high before the howling blast
And many perished in the whirlwind sweep
We gazed with terror on their gloomy sleep 
Untaught that soon such anguish must ensue
Our hopes such harvest of affliction reap 
That we the mercy of the waves should rue
The pains and plagues that on our heads came down
Disease and famine agony and fear
In wood or wilderness in camp or town 
It would unman the firmest heart to hear 
All perished all in one remorseless year
Husband and children one by one by sword
And ravenous plague all perished every tear
Dried up despairing desolate on board 
Here paused she of all present thought forlorn
Nor voice nor sound that moment pain expressed
Yet Nature with excess of grief o'erborne
From her full eyes their watery load released 
He too was mute and ere her weeping ceased
He rose and to the ruin portal went
And saw the dawn opening the silvery east
With rays of promise north and southward sent
O come he cried come after weary night
Of such rough storm this happy change to view
So forth she came and eastward looked the sight
Over her brow like dawn of gladness threw
Upon her cheek to which its youthful hue 
Seemed to return dried the last lingering tear
And from her grateful heart a fresh one drew
The whilst her comrade to her pensive cheer
They looked and saw a lengthening road and wain 
That rang down a bare slope not far remote
The barrows glistered bright with drops of rain
Whistled the waggoner with merry note
The cock far off sounded his clarion throat
But town or farm or hamlet none they viewed 
Only were told there stood a lonely cot
A long mile thence While thither they pursued
Peaceful as this immeasurable plain
Is now by beams of dawning light imprest 
In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main
The very ocean hath its hour of rest
I too forgot the heavings of my breast 
How quiet 'round me ship and ocean were
As quiet all within me I was blest 
And looked and fed upon the silent air
Ah how unlike those late terrific sleeps
And groans that rage of racking famine spoke
The unburied dead that lay in festering heaps 
The breathing pestilence that rose like smoke
The shriek that from the distant battle broke
The mine dire earthquake and the pallid host
Driven by the bomb incessant thunder-stroke
To loathsome vaults where heart-sick anguish tossed 
Some mighty gulf of separation passed
I seemed transported to another world
A thought resigned with pain when from the mast
The impatient mariner the sail unfurled 
And whistling called the wind that hardly curled
The silent sea From the sweet thoughts of home
And from all hope I was for ever hurled
For me farthest from earthly port to roam
And oft I thought my fancy was so strong
That I at last a resting-place had found
'Here will I dwell' said I 'my whole life long 
Roaming the illimitable waters round
Here will I live of all but heaven disowned 
And end my days upon the peaceful flood' 
To break my dream the vessel reached its bound
And homeless near a thousand homes I stood
No help I sought in sorrow turned adrift 
Was hopeless as if cast on some bare rock 
Nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift
Nor raised my hand at any door to knock
I lay where with his drowsy mates the cock
From the cross-timber of an out-house hung 
Dismally tolled that night the city clock
At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung
So passed a second day and when the third
Was come I tried in vain the crowd resort 
 In deep despair by frightful wishes stirred
Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort
There pains which nature could no more support
With blindness linked did on my vitals fall
And after many interruptions short 
Of hideous sense I sank nor step could crawl
Borne to a hospital I lay with brain
Drowsy and weak and shattered memory 
I heard my neighbours in their beds complain 
Of many things which never troubled me 
Of feet still bustling round with busy glee
Of looks where common kindness had no part
Of service done with cold formality 
Fretting the fever round the languid heart 
These things just served to stir the slumbering sense
Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised
With strength did memory return and thence
Dismissed again on open day I gazed 
At houses men and common light amazed
The lanes I sought and as the sun retired
Came where beneath the trees a faggot blazed
The travellers saw me weep my fate inquired
Rough potters seemed they trading soberly
With panniered asses driven from door to door
But life of happier sort set forth to me 
And other joys my fancy to allure 
The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor 
In barn uplighted and companions boon
Well met from far with revelry secure
Among the forest glades while jocund June 
But ill they suited me those journeys dark 
O'er moor and mountain midnight theft to hatch
To charm the surly house-dog faithful bark
Or hang on tip-toe at the lifted latch
The gloomy lantern and the dim blue match
The black disguise the warning whistle shrill 
And ear still busy on its nightly watch
Were not for me brought up in nothing ill
What could I do unaided and unblest
My father gone was every friend of thine 
And kindred of dead husband are at best
Small help and after marriage such as mine
With little kindness would to me incline
Nor was I then for toil or service fit
My deep-drawn sighs no effort could confine 
In open air forgetful would I sit 
The roads I paced I loitered through the fields
Contentedly yet sometimes self-accused
Trusted my life to what chance bounty yields 
Now coldly given now utterly refused
The ground I for my bed have often used
But what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth
Is that I have my inner self abused
Forgone the home delight of constant truth 
Through tears the rising sun I oft have viewed
Through tears have seen him towards that world descend 
Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude
Three years a wanderer now my course I bend  
Oh tell me whither for no earthly friend
Have I She ceased and weeping turned away
As if because her tale was at an end
She wept because she had no more to say
True sympathy the Sailor looks expressed
His looks for pondering he was mute the while
Of social Order care for wretchedness
Of Time sure help to calm and reconcile
Joy second spring and Hope long-treasured smile 
'Twas not for him to speak a man so tried
Yet to relieve her heart in friendly style
Proverbial words of comfort he applied
Ere long from heaps of turf before their sight 
Together smoking in the sun slant beam
Rise various wreaths that into one unite
Which high and higher mounts with silver gleam
Fair spectacle but instantly a scream
Thence bursting shrill did all remark prevent 
They paused and heard a hoarser voice blaspheme
And female cries Their course they thither bent
A woman stood with quivering lips and pale
And pointing to a little child that lay 
Stretched on the ground began a piteous tale
How in a simple freak of thoughtless play
He had provoked his father who straightway
As if each blow were deadlier than the last
Struck the poor innocent Pallid with dismay 
The Soldier Widow heard and stood aghast
His voice with indignation rising high
Such further deed in manhood name forbade
The peasant wild in passion made reply 
With bitter insult and revilings sad
Asked him in scorn what business there he had
What kind of plunder he was hunting now
The gallows would one day of him be glad 
Though inward anguish damped the Sailor brow 
Softly he stroked the child who lay outstretched
With face to earth and as the boy turned round
His battered head a groan the Sailor fetched
As if he saw there and upon that ground  
Strange repetition of the deadly wound
He had himself inflicted Through his brain
At once the griding iron passage found D
Deluge of tender thoughts then rushed amain
Within himself he said What hearts have we
The blessing this a father gives his child
Yet happy thou poor boy compared with me
Suffering not doing ill fate far more mild
The stranger looks and tears of wrath beguiled 
The father and relenting thoughts awoke
He kissed his son so all was reconciled
Then with a voice which inward trouble broke
Bad is the world and hard is the world law 
Even for the man who wears the warmest fleece
Much need have ye that time more closely draw
The bond of nature all unkindness cease
And that among so few there still be peace
Else can ye hope but with such numerous foes 
Your pains shall ever with your years increase 
While from his heart the appropriate lesson flows
Forthwith the pair passed on and down they look
Into a narrow valley pleasant scene 
Where wreaths of vapour tracked a winding brook
That babbled on through groves and meadows green
A low-roofed house peeped out the trees between
The dripping groves resound with cheerful lays
And melancholy lowings intervene 
Of scattered herds that in the meadow graze
They saw and heard and winding with the road
Down a thick wood they dropt into the vale
Comfort by prouder mansions unbestowed 
Their wearied frames she hoped would soon regale
Erelong they reached that cottage in the dale
It was a rustic inn the board was spread
The milk-maid followed with her brimming pail
And lustily the master carved the bread 
Their breakfast done the pair though loth must part
Wanderers whose course no longer now agrees
She rose and bade farewell and while her heart
Struggled with tears nor could its sorrow ease 
She left him there for clustering round his knees
With his oak-staff the cottage children played
And soon she reached a spot o'erhung with trees
And banks of ragged earth beneath the shade
A cart and horse beside the rivulet stood
Chequering the canvas roof the sunbeams shone
She saw the carman bend to scoop the flood
As the wain fronted her wherein lay one
A pale-faced Woman in disease far gone 
The carman wet her lips as well behoved
Bed under her lean body there was none
Though even to die near one she most had loved
The Soldier Widow learned with honest pain 
And homefelt force of sympathy sincere
Why thus that worn-out wretch must there sustain
The jolting road and morning air severe
The wain pursued its way and following near
In pure compassion she her steps retraced 
Far as the cottage A sad sight is here
She cried aloud and forth ran out in haste
While to the door with eager speed they ran
From her bare straw the Woman half upraised 
Her bony visage gaunt and deadly wan
No pity asking on the group she gazed
With a dim eye distracted and amazed
Then sank upon her straw with feeble moan
Fervently cried the housewife God be praised 
I have a house that I can call my own
So in they bear her to the chimney seat
And busily though yet with fear untie
Her garments and to warm her icy feet 
And chafe her temples careful hands apply
Nature reviving with a deep-drawn sigh
She strove and not in vain her head to rear
Then said I thank you all if I must die
The God in heaven my prayers for you will hear 
Barred every comfort labour could procure
Suffering what no endurance could assuage
I was compelled to seek my father door
Though loth to be a burthen on his age 
But sickness stopped me in an early stage
Of my sad journey and within the wain
They placed me there to end life pilgrimage
Unless beneath your roof I may remain
My life Heaven knows hath long been burthensome
But if I have not meekly suffered meek
May my end be Soon will this voice be dumb
Should child of mine e'er wander hither speak
Of me say that the worm is on my cheek  
Torn from our hut that stood beside the sea
Near Portland lighthouse in a lonesome creek
My husband served in sad captivity
A sailor wife I knew a widow cares 
Yet two sweet little ones partook my bed
Hope cheered my dreams and to my daily prayers
Our heavenly Father granted each day bread
Till one was found by stroke of violence dead
Whose body near our cottage chanced to lie 
A dire suspicion drove us from our shed
In vain to find a friendly face we try
For evil tongues made oath how on that day
My husband lurked about the neighbourhood 
Now he had fled and whither none could say
And he had done the deed in the dark wood 
Near his own home but he was mild and good
Never on earth was gentler creature seen
He'd not have robbed the raven of its food 
My husband loving kindness stood between
Alas the thing she told with labouring breath
The Sailor knew too well That wickedness
His hand had wrought and when in the hour of death 
He saw his Wife lips move his name to bless
With her last words unable to suppress
His anguish with his heart he ceased to strive
And weeping loud in this extreme distress
He cried Do pity me That thou shouldst live 
To tell the change that Voice within her wrought
Nature by sign or sound made no essay
A sudden joy surprised expiring thought
And every mortal pang dissolved away 
Borne gently to a bed in death she lay
Yet still while over her the husband bent
A look was in her face which seemed to say
Be blest by sight of thee from heaven was sent
She slept in peace his pulses throbbed and stopped
Breathless he gazed upon her face then took
Her hand in his and raised it but both dropped
When on his own he cast a rueful look
His ears were never silent sleep forsook 
His burning eyelids stretched and stiff as lead
All night from time to time under him shook
The floor as he lay shuddering on his bed
The Soldier Widow lingered in the cot 
And when he rose he thanked her pious care
Through which his Wife to that kind shelter brought
Died in his arms and with those thanks a prayer
He breathed for her and for that merciful pair
The corse interred not one hour he remained 
Beneath their roof but to the open air
A burthen now with fortitude sustained
Confirmed of purpose fearlessly prepared
For act and suffering to the city straight 
He journeyed and forthwith his crime declared
And from your doom he added now I wait
Nor let it linger long the murderer fate
Not ineffectual was that piteous claim
O welcome sentence which will end though late 
He said the pangs that to my conscience came
His fate was pitied Him in iron case
Reader forgive the intolerable thought
They hung not no one on his form or face 
Could gaze as on a show by idlers sought
No kindred sufferer to his death-place brought
By lawless curiosity or chance
When into storm the evening sky is wrought
Upon his swinging corse an eye can glance 
I saw an aged Beggar in my walk
And he was seated by the highway side
On a low structure of rude masonry
Built at the foot of a huge hill that they
Who lead their horses down the steep rough road 
May thence remount at ease The aged Man
Had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone
That overlays the pile and from a bag
All white with flour the dole of village dames
He drew his scraps and fragments one by one 
And scanned them with a fixed and serious look
Of idle computation In the sun
Upon the second step of that small pile
Surrounded by those wild unpeopled hills
He sat and ate his food in solitude 
And ever scattered from his palsied hand
That still attempting to prevent the waste
Was baffled still the crumbs in little showers
Fell on the ground and the small mountain birds
Not venturing yet to peck their destined meal 
Approached within the length of half his staff
Him from my childhood have I known and then
He was so old he seems not older now
He travels on a solitary Man
So helpless in appearance that for him 
The sauntering Horseman throws not with a slack
And careless hand his alms upon the ground
But stops that he may safely lodge the coin
Within the old Man hat nor quits him so
But still when he has given his horse the rein 
Watches the aged Beggar with a look 
Sidelong and half-reverted She who tends
The toll-gate when in summer at her door
She turns her wheel if on the road she sees
The aged beggar coming quits her work 
And lifts the latch for him that he may pass
The post-boy when his rattling wheels o'ertake
The aged Beggar in the woody lane
Shouts to him from behind and if thus warned 
The old man does not change his course the boy 
Turns with less noisy wheels to the roadside
And passes gently by without a curse
Upon his lips or anger at his heart
He travels on a solitary Man
His age has no companion On the ground 
His eyes are turned and as he moves along
They move along the ground and evermore
Instead of common and habitual sight
Of fields with rural works of hill and dale
And the blue sky one little span of earth 
Is all his prospect Thus from day to day
Bow-bent his eyes for ever on the ground 
He plies his weary journey seeing still
And seldom knowing that he sees some straw
Some scattered leaf or marks which in one track 
The nails of cart or chariot-wheel have left
Impressed on the white road in the same line
At distance still the same Poor Traveller
His staff trails with him scarcely do his feet 
Disturb the summer dust he is so still 
In look and motion that the cottage curs 
Ere he has passed the door will turn away
Weary of barking at him Boys and girls
The vacant and the busy maids and youths
And urchins newly breeched all pass him by 
Him even the slow-paced waggon leaves behind
But deem not this Man useless Statesmen ye
Who are so restless in your wisdom ye
Who have a broom still ready in your hands
To rid the world of nuisances ye proud 
Heart-swoln while in your pride ye contemplate
Your talents power or wisdom deem him not
A burthen of the earth 'Tis nature law
That none the meanest of created things
Of forms created the most vile and brute 
The dullest or most noxious should exist
Divorced from good a spirit and pulse of good
A life and soul to every mode of being
Inseparably linked Then be assured
That least of all can aught that ever owned 
The heaven-regarding eye and front sublime C
Which man is born to sink howe'er depressed
So low as to be scorned without a sin
Without offence to God cast out of view
Like the dry remnant of a garden-flower 
Whose seeds are shed or as an implement
Worn out and worthless While from door to door
This old Man creeps the villagers in him
Behold a record which together binds
Past deeds and offices of charity 
Else unremembered and so keeps alive
The kindly mood in hearts which lapse of years
And that half-wisdom half-experience gives
Make slow to feel and by sure steps resign
To selfishness and cold oblivious cares 
Among the farms and solitary huts
Hamlets and thinly-scattered villages
Where'er the aged Beggar takes his rounds
The mild necessity of use compels
To acts of love and habit does the work 
Of reason yet prepares that after-joy
Which reason cherishes And thus the soul
By that sweet taste of pleasure unpursued
Doth find herself insensibly disposed
To virtue and true goodness Some there are
By their good works exalted lofty minds
And meditative authors of delight
And happiness which to the end of time
Will live and spread and kindle even such minds 
In childhood from this solitary Being
Or from like wanderer haply have received 
A thing more precious far than all that books
Or the solicitudes of love can do
That first mild touch of sympathy and thought 
In which they found their kindred with a world
Where want and sorrow were The easy man
Who sits at his own door and like the pear
That overhangs his head from the green wall
Feeds in the sunshine the robust and young 
The prosperous and unthinking they who live
Sheltered and flourish in a little grove
Of their own kindred all behold in him
A silent monitor which on their minds
Must needs impress a transitory thought 
Of self-congratulation to the heart
Of each recalling his peculiar boons
His charters and exemptions and perchance
Though he to no one give the fortitude
And circumspection needful to preserve 
His present blessings and to husband up
The respite of the season he at least
And 'tis no vulgar service makes them felt
Yet further Many I believe there are
Who live a life of virtuous decency 
Men who can hear the Decalogue and feel
No self-reproach who of the moral law
Established in the land where they abide
Are strict observers and not negligent
In acts of love to those with whom they dwell 
Their kindred and the children of their blood
Praise be to such and to their slumbers peace
 But of the poor man ask the abject poor
Go and demand of him if there be here
In this cold abstinence from evil deeds 
And these inevitable charities
Wherewith to satisfy the human soul
No man is dear to man the poorest poor
Long for some moments in a weary life
When they can know and feel that they have been 
Themselves the fathers and the dealers-out
Of some small blessings have been kind to such
As needed kindness for this single cause
That we have all of us one human heart
 Such pleasure is to one kind Being known 
My neighbour when with punctual care each week
Duly as Friday comes though pressed herself
By her own wants she from her store of meal
Takes one unsparing handful for the scrip
Of this old Mendicant and from her door 
Returning with exhilarated heart
Sits by her fire and builds her hope in heaven
Then let him pass a blessing on his head
And while in that vast solitude to which
The tide of things has borne him he appears 
To breathe and live but for himself alone
Unblamed uninjured let him bear about
The good which the benignant law of Heaven
Has hung around him and while life is his
Still let him prompt the unlettered villagers 
To tender offices and pensive thoughts D
 Then let him pass a blessing on his head
And long as he can wander let him breathe
The freshness of the valleys let his blood
Struggle with frosty air and winter snows 
And let the chartered wind that sweeps the heath
Beat his grey locks against his withered face
Reverence the hope whose vital anxiousness
Gives the last human interest to his heart
May never HOUSE misnamed of INDUSTRY 
Make him a captive for that pent-up din
Those life-consuming sounds that clog the air
Be his the natural silence of old age
Let him be free of mountain solitudes
And have around him whether heard or not 
The pleasant melody of woodland birds
Few are his pleasures if his eyes have now
Been doomed so long to settle upon earth
That not without some effort they behold
The countenance of the horizontal sun 
Rising or setting let the light at least
Find a free entrance to their languid orbs
And let him where and when he will sit down
Beneath the trees or on a grassy bank
Of highway side and with the little birds 
Share his chance-gathered meal and finally
As in the eye of Nature he has lived
So in the eye of Nature let him die E
Were there below a spot of holy ground
By Pain and her sad family unfound
Sure Nature GOD that spot to man had giv'n
Where murmuring rivers join the song of ev'n
Where falls the purple morning far and wide 
In flakes of light upon the mountain-side
Where summer Suns in ocean sink to rest
Or moonlight Upland lifts her hoary breast
Where Silence on her night of wing o'er-broods
Unfathom'd dells and undiscover'd woods 
Where rocks and groves the power of waters shakes
In cataracts or sleeps in quiet lakes
But doubly pitying Nature loves to show'r
Soft on his wounded heart her healing pow'r
Who plods o'er hills and vales his road forlorn 
Wooing her varying charms from eve to morn
No sad vacuities his heart annoy
Blows not a Zephyr but it whispers joy
For him lost flowers their idle sweets exhale
He tastes the meanest note that swells the gale 
For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn
And peeps the far-off spire his evening bourn
Dear is the forest frowning o'er his head
And dear the green-sward to his velvet tread
Moves there a cloud o'er mid-day flaming eye 
Upward he looks and calls it luxury
Kind Nature charities his steps attend
In every babbling brook he finds a friend
While chast'ning thoughts of sweetest use bestow'd
By Wisdom moralize his pensive road 
Host of his welcome inn the noon-tide bow'r
To his spare meal he calls the passing poor
He views the Sun uprear his golden fire
Or sink with heart alive like B Memnon lyre
Blesses the Moon that comes with kindest ray 
To light him shaken by his viewless way
With bashful fear no cottage children steal
From him a brother at the cottage meal
His humble looks no shy restraint impart
Around him plays at will the virgin heart 
While unsuspended wheels the village dance
The maidens eye him with inquiring glance
Much wondering what sad stroke of crazing Care
Or desperate Love could lead a wanderer there
Me lur'd by hope her sorrows to remove 
A heart that could not much itself approve
O'er Gallia wastes of corn dejected led
C Her road elms rustling thin above my head
Or through her truant pathway native charms
By secret villages and lonely farms 
To where the Alps ascending white in air
Toy with the Sun and glitter from afar
Ev'n now I sigh at hoary Chartreuse' doom
Weeping beneath his chill of mountain gloom
Where now is fled that Power whose frown severe 
Tam'd sober Reason till she crouch'd in fear
That breath'd a death-like peace these woods around
Broke only by th' unvaried torrent sound
Or prayer-bell by the dull cicada drown'd
The cloister startles at the gleam of arms 
And Blasphemy the shuddering fane alarms
Nod the cloud-piercing pines their troubl'd heads
Spires rocks and lawns a browner night o'erspreads
Strong terror checks the female peasant sighs
And start th' astonish'd shades at female eyes 
The thundering tube the aged angler hears
And swells the groaning torrent with his tears
From Bruno forest screams the frighted jay
And slow th' insulted eagle wheels away
The cross with hideous laughter Demons mock 
By D angels planted on the aereal rock
The parting Genius sighs with hollow breath
Along the mystic streams of E Life and Death
Swelling the outcry dull that long resounds
Portentous thro' her old woods' trackless bounds 
Deepening her echoing torrents' awful peal
And bidding paler shades her form conceal
F Vallombre mid her falling fanes deplores
For ever broke the sabbath of her bow'rs
More pleas'd my foot the hidden margin roves 
Of Como bosom'd deep in chesnut groves
No meadows thrown between the giddy steeps
Tower bare or sylvan from the narrow deeps
To towns whose shades of no rude sound complain
To ringing team unknown and grating wain 
To flat-roof'd towns that touch the water bound
Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound
Or from the bending rocks obtrusive cling
And o'er the whiten'd wave their shadows fling
Wild round the steeps the little G pathway twines 
And Silence loves it purple roof of vines
The viewless lingerer hence at evening sees
From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees
Or marks mid opening cliffs fair dark-ey'd maids
Tend the small harvest of their garden glades 
Or led by distant warbling notes surveys
With hollow ringing ears and darkening gaze
Binding the charmed soul in powerless trance
Lip-dewing Song and ringlet-tossing Dance
Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume 
The bosom'd cabin lyre-enliven'd gloom
Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view
Stretch o'er their pictur'd mirror broad and blue
Tracking the yellow sun from steep to steep
As up th' opposing hills with tortoise foot they creep 
Here half a village shines in gold array'd
Bright as the moon half hides itself in shade
From the dark sylvan roofs the restless spire
Inconstant glancing mounts like springing fire
There all unshaded blazing forests throw no 
Rich golden verdure on the waves below
Slow glides the sail along th' illumin'd shore
And steals into the shade the lazy oar
Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs
And amourous music on the water dies 
Heedless how Pliny musing here survey'd
Old Roman boats and figures thro' the shade
Pale Passion overpower'd retires and woos
The thicket where th' unlisten'd stock-dove coos
How bless'd delicious Scene the eye that greets 
Thy open beauties or thy lone retreats
Th' unwearied sweep of wood thy cliffs that scales
The never-ending waters of thy vales
The cots those dim religious groves enbow'r
Or under rocks that from the water tow'r 
Insinuated sprinkling all the shore
Each with his household boat beside the door
Whose flaccid sails in forms fantastic droop
Bright'ning the gloom where thick the forests stoop
 Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky 
Thy towns like swallows' nests that cleave on high
That glimmer hoar in eve last light descry'd
Dim from the twilight water shaggy side
Whence lutes and voices down th' enchanted woods
Steal and compose the oar-forgotten floods 
While Evening solemn bird melodious weeps
Heard by star-spotted bays beneath the steeps
 Thy lake mid smoking woods that blue and grey
Gleams streak'd or dappled hid from morning ray
Slow-travelling down the western hills to fold 
It green-ting'd margin in a blaze of gold
From thickly-glittering spires the matin-bell
Calling the woodman from his desert cell
A summons to the sound of oars that pass
Spotting the steaming deeps to early mass 
Slow swells the service o'er the water born
While fill each pause the ringing woods of morn
Farewel those forms that in thy noon-tide shade
Rest near their little plots of wheaten glade
Those stedfast eyes that beating breasts inspire 
To throw the sultry ray of young Desire
Those lips whose tides of fragrance come and go
Accordant to the cheek unquiet glow
Those shadowy breasts in love soft light array'd
And rising by the moon of passion sway'd 
 Thy fragrant gales and lute-resounding streams
Breathe o'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams
While Slavery forcing the sunk mind to dwell
On joys that might disgrace the captive cell
Her shameless timbrel shakes along thy marge 
And winds between thine isles the vocal barge
Yet arts are thine that rock th' unsleeping heart
And smiles to Solitude and Want impart
I lov'd mid thy most desert woods astray
With pensive step to measure my slow way H 
By lonely silent cottage-doors to roam
The far-off peasant day-deserted home
Once did I pierce to where a cabin stood
The red-breast peace had bury'd it in wood
There by the door a hoary-headed sire 
Touch'd with his wither'd hand an aged lyre
Beneath an old-grey oak as violets lie
Stretch'd at his feet with stedfast upward eye
His children children join'd the holy sound
A hermit with his family around 
Hence shall we seek where fair Locarno smiles
Embower'd in walnut slopes and citron isles
Or charms that smile on Tusa evening stream
While mid dim towers and woods her I waters gleam
From the bright wave in solemn gloom retire 
The dull-red steeps and darkening still aspire
To where afar rich orange lustres glow
Round undistinguish'd clouds and rocks and snow
Or led where Viamala chasms confine
Th' indignant waters of the infant Rhine 
Bend o'er th' abyss the else impervious gloom
His burning eyes with fearful light illume
The Grison gypsey here her tent has plac'd
Sole human tenant of the piny waste
Her tawny skin dark eyes and glossy locks 
Bend o'er the smoke that curls beneath the rocks
 The mind condemn'd without reprieve to go
O'er life long deserts with it charge of woe
With sad congratulation joins the train
Where beasts and men together o'er the plain 
Move on a mighty caravan of pain
Hope strength and courage social suffering brings
Freshening the waste of sand with shades and springs
 She solitary through the desert drear
Spontaneous wanders hand in hand with Fear 
A giant moan along the forest swells
Protracted and the twilight storm foretells
And ruining from the cliffs their deafening load
Tumbles the wildering Thunder slips abroad
On the high summits Darkness comes and goes 
Hiding their fiery clouds their rocks and snows
The torrent travers'd by the lustre broad
Starts like a horse beside the flashing road
In the roof'd J bridge at that despairing hour
She seeks a shelter from the battering show'r 
 Fierce comes the river down the crashing wood
Gives way and half it pines torment the flood
K Fearful beneath the Water-spirits call
And the bridge vibrates tottering to its fall
 Heavy and dull and cloudy is the night 
No star supplies the comfort of it light
Glimmer the dim-lit Alps dilated round
And one sole light shifts in the vale profound
While opposite the waning moon hangs still
And red above her melancholy hill 
By the deep quiet gloom appall'd she sighs
Stoops her sick head and shuts her weary eyes
 Breaking th' ascending roar of desert floods
And insect buzz that stuns the sultry woods
She hears upon the mountain forest brow 
The death-dog howling loud and long below
On viewless fingers counts the valley-clock
Followed by drowsy crow of midnight cock
 Bursts from the troubl'd Larch giant boughs
The pie and chattering breaks the night repose 
Low barks the fox by Havoc rouz'd the bear
Quits growling the white bones that strew his lair
The dry leaves stir as with the serpent walk
And far beneath Banditti voices talk
Behind her hill the Moon all crimson rides 
And his red eyes the slinking Water hides
Then all is hush'd the bushes rustle near
And with strange tinglings sings her fainting ear
 Vex'd by the darkness from the piny gulf
Ascending nearer howls the famish'd wolf 
While thro' the stillness scatters wild dismay
Her babe small cry that leads him to his prey
Now passing Urseren open vale serene
Her quiet streams and hills of downy green
Plunge with the Russ embrown'd by Terror breath 
Where danger roofs the narrow walks of death
By floods that thundering from their dizzy height
Swell more gigantic on the stedfast sight
Black drizzling craggs that beaten by the din
Vibrate as if a voice complain'd within 
Bare steeps where Desolation stalks afraid
Unstedfast by a blasted yew upstay'd
By L cells whose image trembling as he prays
Awe-struck the kneeling peasant scarce surveys
Loose-hanging rocks the Day bless'd eye that hide 
And M crosses rear'd to Death on every side
Which with cold kiss Devotion planted near
And bending water'd with the human tear
Soon fading silent from her upward eye
Unmov'd with each rude form of Danger nigh 
Fix'd on the anchor left by him who saves
Alike in whelming snows and roaring waves
On as we move a softer prospect opes
Calm huts and lawns between and sylvan slopes
While mists suspended on th' expiring gale 
Moveless o'er-hang the deep secluded vale
The beams of evening slipping soft between
Light up of tranquil joy a sober scene
Winding it dark-green wood and emerald glade
The still vale lengthens underneath the shade 
While in soft gloom the scattering bowers recede
Green dewy lights adorn the freshen'd mead
Where solitary forms illumin'd stray
Turning with quiet touch the valley hay
On the low N brown wood-huts delighted sleep 
Along the brighten'd gloom reposing deep
While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull
And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull
In solemn shapes before th' admiring eye
Dilated hang the misty pines on high 
Huge convent domes with pinnacles and tow'rs
And antique castles seen tho' drizzling show'rs
From such romantic dreams my sould awake
Lo Fear looks silent down on Uri lake
By whose unpathway'd margin still and dread 
Was never heard the plodding peasant tread
Tower like a wall the naked rocks or reach
Far o'er the secret water dark with beech
More high to where creation seems to end
Shade above shade the desert pines ascend 
And still below where mid the savage scene
Peeps out a little speck of smilgin green
There with his infants man undaunted creeps
And hangs his small wood-hut upon the steeps
A garden-plot the desert air perfumes 
Mid the dark pines a little orchard blooms
A zig-zag path from the domestic skiff
Threading the painful cragg surmounts the cliff
 Before those hermit doors that never know
The face of traveller passing to and fro 
No peasant leans upon his pole to tell
For whom at morning toll'd the funeral bell
Their watch-dog ne'er his angry bark forgoes
Touch'd by the beggar moan of human woes
The grass seat beneath their casement shade 
The pilgrim wistful eye hath never stay'd
 There did the iron Genius not disdain
The gentle Power that haunts the myrtle plain
There might the love-sick maiden sit and chide
Th' insuperable rocks and severing tide 
There watch at eve her lover sun-gilt sail
Approaching and upbraid the tardy gale
There list at midnight till is heard no more
Below the echo of his parting oar
There hang in fear when growls the frozen stream 
To guide his dangerous tread the taper gleam
Mid stormy vapours ever driving by
Where ospreys cormorants and herons cry
Where hardly giv'n the hopeless waste to chear
Deny'd the bread of life the foodful ear 
Dwindles the pear on autumn latest spray
And apple sickens pale in summer ray
Ev'n here Content has fix'd her smiling reign
With Independance child of high Disdain
Exulting mid the winter of the skies 
Shy as the jealous chamois Freedom flies
And often grasps her sword and often eyes
Her crest a bough of Winter bleakest pine
Strange weeds and alpine plants her helm entwine
And wildly-pausing oft she hangs aghast 
While thrills the Spartan fife between the blast
'Tis storm and hid in mist from hour to hour
All day the floods a deeper murmur pour
And mournful sounds as of a Spirit lost
Pipe wild along the hollow-blustering coast 
'Till the Sun walking on his western field
Shakes from behind the clouds his flashing shield
Triumphant on the bosom of the storm
Glances the fire-clad eagle wheeling form
Eastward in long perspective glittering shine 
The wood-crown'd cliffs that o'er the lake recline
Wide o'er the Alps a hundred streams unfold
At once to pillars turn'd that flame with gold
Behind his sail the peasant strives to shun
The west that burns like one dilated sun 
Where in a mighty crucible expire
The mountains glowing hot like coals of fire O
But lo the boatman over-aw'd before
The pictur'd fane of Tell suspends his oar
Confused the Marathonian tale appears 
While burn in his full eyes the glorious tears
And who but feels a power of strong controul
Felt only there oppress his labouring soul
Who walks where honour'd men of ancient days
Have wrought with god-like arm the deeds of praise 
Say who by thinking on Canadian hills
Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills
On Zutphen plain or where with soften'd gaze
The old grey stones the plaided chief surveys
Can guess the high resolve the cherish'd pain 
Of him whom passion rivets to the plain
Where breath'd the gale that caught Wolfe happiest sigh
And the last sun-beam fell on Bayard eye
Where bleeding Sydney from the cup retir'd
And glad Dundee in faint huzzas expir'd 
But now with other soul I stand alone
Sublime upon this far-surveying cone
And watch from P pike to pike amid the sky
Small as a bird the chamois-chaser fly
'Tis his with fearless step at large to roam 
Thro' wastes of Spirits wing'd the solemn home
Q Thro' vacant worlds where Nature never gave
A brook to murmur or a bough to wave
Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep
Thro' worlds where Life and Sound and Motion sleep 
Where Silence still her death-like reign extends
Save when the startling cliff unfrequent rends
In the deep snow the mighty ruin drown'd
Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound
 To mark a planet pomp and steady light 
In the least star of scarce-appearing night
And neighbouring moon that coasts the vast profound
Wheel pale and silent her diminish'd round
While far and wide the icy summits blaze
Rejoicing in the glory of her rays 
The star of noon that glitters small and bright
Shorn of his beams insufferably white
And flying fleet behind his orb to view
Th' interminable sea of sable blue
 Of cloudless suns no more ye frost-built spires 
Refract in rainbow hues the restless fires
Ye dewy mists the arid rocks o'er-spread
Whose slippery face derides his deathful tread
 To wet the peak impracticable sides
He opens of his feet the sanguine tides 
Weak and more weak the issuing current eyes
Lapp'd by the panting tongue of thirsty skies R
 At once bewildering mists around him close
And cold and hunger are his least of woes
The Demon of the snow with angry roar 
Descending shuts for aye his prison door
Craz'd by the strength of hope at morn he eyes
As sent from heav'n the raven of the skies
Then with despair whole weight his spirits sink
No bread to feed him and the snow his drink 
While ere his eyes can close upon the day
The eagle of the Alps o'ershades his prey
 Meanwhile his wife and child with cruel hope
All night the door at every moment ope
Haply that child in fearful doubt may gaze 
Passing his father bones in future days
Start at the reliques of that very thigh
On which so oft he prattled when a boy
Hence shall we turn where heard with fear afar
Thunders thro' echoing pines the headlong Aar 
Or rather stay to taste the mild delights
Of pensive S Underwalden pastoral heights
 Is there who mid these awful wilds has seen
The native Genii walk the mountain green
Or heard while other worlds their charms reveal 
Soft music from th' aereal summit steal
While o'er the desert answering every close
Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes
 And sure there is a secret Power that reigns
Here where no trace of man the spot profanes 
Nought but the herds that pasturing upward creep
Hung dim-discover'd from the dangerous steep
T Or summer hamlet flat and bare on high
Suspended mid the quiet of the sky
How still no irreligious sound or sight 
Rouzes the soul from her severe delight
An idle voice the sabbath region fills
Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills
Broke only by the melancholy sound
Of drowsy bells for ever tinkling round 
Is dull to what makes everything of worth
And though may be a shallow bodily joy
Oft tingles through them at the breathing spring
Or first-heard exultation of the lark
Still that deep weight draws ever steadily
Their thoughts and passions back to secret woe
Though if endowed with light heroic deeds
May be achieved and if benignly bent
They may be treasured blessings through their lives
Yet power and goodness are to them as dreams
And they heed vaguely if their waking sight
Be met with slanting storm against the pane
Or sunshine glittering on the leaves that play
In purest blue of breezy summer morns
Whence springs this well of mournfulness profound
Unfathomable to plummet cast by man
Alas for who can tell Whence comes the wind
Heaving the ocean into maddened arms
That clutch and dash huge vessels on the rocks
And scatter them as if compacted slight
As little eggs boys star against a tree
In wanton mischief Whence detestable
To man who suffers from the monster-jaws
The power that in the logging crocodiles
Outrageous bulk puts evil fire of life
That spouts from mountain-pyramids a flood
Of lava overwhelming works and men
In burning fetid ruin The power that stings
A city with a pestilence or turns
The pretty babe who in his mother lap
Babbles her back the lavished kiss and laugh
Through lusts and vassalage to obdurate sin
Into a knife-armed midnight murderer
Our lives are mysteries and rarely scanned
As we read stories writ by mortal pen
We can perchance but catch a straying weft
And trace the hinted texture here or there
Of that stupendous loom weaving our fates
Two parents late in life are haply blessed
With one bright child a wonder in his years
For loveliness and genius versatile
Some common ill destroys him parents both
Until their death are left but living tombs
That hold the one dead image of their joy
A man the flower of honour who has found
His well-beloved young daughter fled from home
Fallen from her maidenhood a nameless thing
Tainting his blood A youth who throws the strength
Of his whole being into love for one
Answering him honeyed smiles and leaves his land
For some far country seeking wealth he hopes
Will grace her daintily with choice delights
And on returning sees the honeyed smiles
Are sweetening other lips A husband who
Has found that household curse a faithless wife
A thinker whose far-piercing care perceives
His nation goes the road that ends in shame
A gracious woman whose reserve denies
The power to utter what consumes her heart
Such instances and some a loss to know
Which steadfast reticence will shield from those
Debased or garrulous whose hearts corrupt
But learn the gloomy secrets of their kind
To poison-tip their wit or grope and grin
With pharisaic laughter at disgrace 
Such instances as these demand no guide
To thrid the dismal issues from their source
But others are there lying fast concealed
Dark hopeless and unutterably sad
Which have not been and never may be known
Then we may well call happy one whose grief
Mixed up with sacred memories of the past
Can tell to others how the tempest rose
That struck and left him lonely in the world
And who narrating feels his sorrow soothed
By that respect which love and sorrow claim
It much behoves us all but chiefly those
Whom fate has favoured with an easy trust
To keep a bridle upon restless speech
And thought and not in flagrant haste prejudge
The first presentment as the rounded truth
For true it is that rapid thoughts and freak
Of skimming word and glance more frequently
Than either malice settled hate or scorn
Support confusion and pervert the right
Set up the weakling in the strong man place
And yoke the great one strength to idleness
Pour gold into the squanderer purse and suck
The wealth which is a power from their control
Who would have turned it unto noble use
And oftentimes a man will strike his friend
By random verbiage with sharper pain
Than could a foe yet scarcely mean him wrong
For none can strip this complex masquerade
And know who languishes with secret wounds
They whom the brunt of war has maimed in limb
Who lean on crutches to sustain their weight
Are manifest to all and reverence
For their misfortunes kindly gains them place
But wounds sometimes more deep and dangerous
We may in careless jostle through the crowd
Gall and oppress because to us unknown
Then howsoever by our needs impelled
Let us resolve to move in gentleness
Judge mildly when we doubt and pause awhile
Before injustice palpably proclaimed
Ere we let fall the judgment stroke against
Their ignominious craft who ever wait
To filch another right we will maintain
Majestic peace in silence knowing well
Their craft takes something richer from themselves
It is but seemly to respect the great
But never let us fail toward lowly ones
Respecting more in that they lack the force
To claim it of the world For souls there are
Of poor capacities whose purpose holds
Throughout their unregarded lives a worth
And earnest law of fixed integrity
That were an honour even unto those
Whose genius marks the boundaries of our race
Love comes divinely gladdening mortal life
As sunrise dawns upon the gaze of one
Bewildered in some outland waste and lost
Who lonely faint and shuddering through the night
Heard savage creatures nigh and far-off moan
Of tempests on the wind Auroral joy
Flushes the brow of childhood warms his cheek
To rosier redness at the name of Love
And earlier thoughts awake in darkness strive
As unfledged nestlings move their sightless heads
At sound toward a fair world to them unknown
Young Hope scales azure mountain heights to gaze
To viewless realms his Spirit towers amain
Beyond the senses and their little reign
And oft when pass'd that solemn vision by 
He holds with God himself communion high
When the dread peal of swelling torrents fills
The sky-roof'd temple of th' eternal hills
And savage Nature humbly joins the rite
While flash her upward eyes severe delight 
Or gazing from the mountain silent brow
Bright stars of ice and azure worlds of snow
Where needle peaks of granite shooting bare
Tremble in ever-varying tints of air
Great joy by horror tam'd dilates his heart 
And the near heav'ns their own delights impart
 When the Sun bids the gorgeous scene farewell
Alps overlooking Alps their state upswell
Huge Pikes of Darkness nam'd of Y Fear and Storms
Lift all serene their still illumin'd forms 
In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread
Ting'd like an angel smile all rosy red
When downward to his winter hut he goes
Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows
That hut which from the hills his eyes employs 
So oft the central point of all his joys
And as a swift by tender cares oppress'd
Peeps often ere she dart into her nest
So to th' untrodden floor where round him looks
His father helpless as the babe he rocks 
Oft he descends to nurse the brother pair
Till storm and driving ice blockade him there
There hears protected by the woods behind
Secure the chiding of the baffled wind
Hears Winter calling all his Terrors round 
Rush down the living rocks with whirlwind sound
Thro' Nature vale his homely pleasures glide
Unstain'd by envy discontent and pride
The bound of all his vanity to deck
With one bright bell a favourite heifer neck 
Content upon some simple annual feast
Remember'd half the year and hop'd the rest
If dairy produce from his inner hoard
Of thrice ten summers consecrate the board
 Alas in every clime a flying ray 
Is all we have to chear our wintry way
Condemn'd in mists and tempests ever rife
To pant slow up the endless Alp of life
Here cried a swain whose venerable head
Bloom'd with the snow-drops of Man narrow bed 
Last night while by his dying fire as clos'd
The day in luxury my limbs repos'd
Here Penury oft from misery mount will guide
Ev'n to the summer door his icy tide
And here the avalanche of Death destroy 
The little cottage of domestic Joy
But ah th' unwilling mind may more than trace
The general sorrows of the human race
The churlish gales that unremitting blow
Cold from necessity continual snow 
To us the gentle groups of bliss deny
That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie
Yet more the tyrant Genius still at strife
With all the tender Charities of life
When close and closer they begin to strain 
No fond hand left to staunch th' unclosing vein
Tearing their bleeding ties leaves Age to groan
On his wet bed abandon'd and alone
For ever fast as they of strength become
To pay the filial debt for food to roam 
The father forc'd by Powers that only deign
That solitary Man disturb their reign
From his bare nest amid the storms of heaven
Drives eagle-like his sons as he was driven
His last dread pleasure watches to the plain  
And never eagle-like beholds again Z
When the poor heart has all its joys resign'd
Why does their sad remembrance cleave behind
Lo by the lazy Seine the exile roves
Or where thick sails illume Batavia groves 
Soft o'er the waters mournful measures swell
Unlocking bleeding Thought memorial cell
At once upon his heart Despair has set
Her seal the mortal tear his cheek has wet
Strong poison not a form of steel can brave 
Bows his young hairs with sorrow to the grave
Gay lark of hope thy silent song resume
Fair smiling lights the purpled hills illume
Soft gales and dews of life delicious morn
And thou lost fragrance of the heart return 
Aa Soon flies the little joy to man allow'd
And tears before him travel like a cloud
For come Diseases on and Penury rage
Labour and Pain and Grief and joyless Age
And Conscience dogging close his bleeding way 
Cries out and leads her Spectres to their prey
'Till Hope-deserted long in vain his breath
Implores the dreadful untried sleep of Death
 Mid savage rocks and seas of snow that shine
Between interminable tracts of pine 
Round a lone fane the human Genii mourn
Where fierce the rays of woe collected burn
 From viewless lamps a ghastly dimness falls
And ebbs uncertain on the troubled walls
Dim dreadful faces thro' the gloom appear 
Abortive Joy and Hope that works in fear
While strives a secret Power to hush the crowd
Pain wild rebellious burst proclaims her rights aloud
Oh give not me that eye of hard disdain
That views undimm'd Einsiedlen Bb wretched fane 
Mid muttering prayers all sounds of torment meet
Dire clap of hands distracted chafe of feet
While loud and dull ascends the weeping cry
Surely in other thoughts contempt may die
If the sad grave of human ignorance bear 
One flower of hope Oh pass and leave it there
 The tall Sun tiptoe on an Alpine spire
Flings o'er the desert blood-red streams of fire
At such an hour there are who love to stray
And meet the gladdening pilgrims on their way 
 Now with joy tearful kiss each other greet
Nor longer naked be your way-worn feet
For ye have reach'd at last that happy shore
Where the charm'd worm of pain shall gnaw no more
How gayly murmur and how sweetly taste 
The Cc fountains rear'd for you amid the waste
Yes I will see you when ye first behold
Those turrets tipp'd by hope with morning gold
And watch while on your brows the cross ye make
Round your pale eyes a wintry lustre wake 
 Without one hope her written griefs to blot
Save in the land where all things are forgot
My heart alive to transports long unknown
Half wishes your delusion were it own
Last let us turn to where Chamouny Dd shields 
Bosom'd in gloomy woods her golden fields
Five streams of ice amid her cots descend
And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend
A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns
Of purple lights and ever vernal plains 
Here lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fann'd
Here all the Seasons revel hand in hand
 Red stream the cottage lights the landscape fades
Erroneous wavering mid the twilight shades
Alone ascends that mountain nam'd of white Ee 
That dallies with the Sun the summer night
Six thousand years amid his lonely bounds
The voice of Ruin day and night resounds
Where Horror-led his sea of ice assails
Havoc and Chaos blast a thousand vales 
In waves like two enormous serpents wind
And drag their length of deluge train behind
Between the pines enormous boughs descry'd
Serene he towers in deepest purple dy'd
Glad Day-light laughs upon his top of snow 
Glitter the stars above and all is black below
At such an hour I heav'd the human sigh
When roar'd the sullen Arve in anger by
That not for thee delicious vale unfold
Thy reddening orchards and thy fields of gold 
That thou the Ff slave of slaves art doom'd to pine
While no Italian arts their charms combine
To teach the skirt of thy dark cloud to shine
For thy poor babes that hurrying from the door
With pale-blue hands and eyes that fix'd implore 
Dead muttering lips and hair of hungry white
Besiege the traveller whom they half affright
 Yes were it mine the cottage meal to share
Forc'd from my native mountains bleak and bare
O'er Gg Anet hopeless seas of marsh to stray 
Her shrill winds roaring round my lonely way
To scent the sweets of Piedmont breathing rose
And orange gale that o'er Lugano blows
In the wide range of many a weary round
Still have my pilgrim feet unfailing found 
As despot courts their blaze of gems display
Ev'n by the secret cottage far away
The lilly of domestic joy decay
While Freedom farthest hamlets blessings share
Found still beneath her smile and only there 
The casement shade more luscious woodbine binds
And to the door a neater pathway winds
At early morn the careful housewife led
To cull her dinner from it garden bed
Of weedless herbs a healthier prospect sees 
While hum with busier joy her happy bees
In brighter rows her table wealth aspires
And laugh with merrier blaze her evening fires
Her infant cheeks with fresher roses glow
And wilder graces sport around their brow 
By clearer taper lit a cleanlier board
Receives at supper hour her tempting hoard
The chamber hearth with fresher boughs is spread
And whiter is the hospitable bed
 And thou fair favoured region which my soul 
Shall love till Life has broke her golden bowl
Till Death cold touch her cistern-wheel assail
And vain regret and vain desire shall fail
Tho' now where erst the grey-clad peasant stray'd
To break the quiet of the village shade 
Gleam war Hh discordant habits thro' the trees
And the red banner mock the sullen breeze
Tho' now no more thy maids their voices suit
To the low-warbled breath of twilight lute
And heard the pausing village hum between 
No solemn songstress lull the fading green
Scared by the fife and rumbling drum alarms
And the short thunder and the flash of arms
While as Night bids the startling uproar die
Sole sound the Ii sourd renews his mournful cry 
 Yet hast thou found that Freedom spreads her pow'r
Beyond the cottage hearth the cottage door
All nature smiles and owns beneath her eyes
Her fields peculiar and peculiar skies
Yes as I roam'd where Loiret Jj waters glide 
Thro' rustling aspins heard from side to side
When from October clouds a milder light
Fell where the blue flood rippled into white
Methought from every cot the watchful bird
Crowed with ear-piercing power 'till then unheard 
Each clacking mill that broke the murmuring streams
Rock'd the charm'd thought in more delightful dreams
Chasing those long long dreams the falling leaf
Awoke a fainter pang of moral grief
The measured echo of the distant flail 
Winded in sweeter cadence down the vale
A more majestic tide the Kk water roll'd
And glowed the sun-gilt groves in richer gold
 Tho' Liberty shall soon indignant raise
Red on his hills his beacon comet blaze 
Bid from on high his lonely cannon sound
And on ten thousand hearths his shout rebound
His larum-bell from village-tow'r to tow'r
Swing on th' astounded ear it dull undying roar
Yet yet rejoice tho' Pride perverted ire 
Rouze Hell own aid and wrap thy hills in fire
Lo from th' innocuous flames a lovely birth
With it own Virtues springs another earth
Nature as in her prime her virgin reign
Begins and Love and Truth compose her train 
With pulseless hand and fix'd unwearied gaze
Unbreathing Justice her still beam surveys
No more along thy vales and viny groves
Whole hamlets disappearing as he moves
With cheeks o'erspread by smiles of baleful glow 
On his pale horse shall fell Consumption go
Oh give great God to Freedom waves to ride
Sublime o'er Conquest Avarice and Pride
To break the vales where Death with Famine scow'rs
And dark Oppression builds her thick-ribb'd tow'rs 
Where Machination her fell soul resigns
Fled panting to the centre of her mines
Where Persecution decks with ghastly smiles
Her bed his mountains mad Ambition piles
Where Discord stalks dilating every hour 
And crouching fearful at the feet of Pow'r
Like Lightnings eager for th' almighty word
Look up for sign of havoc Fire and Sword Ll
 Give them beneath their breast while Gladness springs
To brood the nations o'er with Nile-like wings 
And grant that every sceptred child of clay
Who cries presumptuous here their tides shall stay
Swept in their anger from th' affrighted shore
With all his creatures sink to rise no more
To-night my friend within this humble cot 
Be the dead load of mortal ills forgot
Renewing when the rosy summits glow
At morn our various journey sad and slow
LIVES there a strain whose sounds of mounting fire
May rise distinguished o'er the din of war
Or died it with yon Master of the Lyre
Who sung beleaguered Ilion evil star
Such WELLINGTON might reach thee from afar
Wafting its descant wide o'er Ocean range
Nor shouts nor clashing arms its mood could mar
Yes such a strain with all o'er-pouring measure
Might melodise with each tumultuous sound
Each voice of fear or triumph woe or pleasure
That rings Mondego ravaged shores around
The thundering cry of hosts with conquest crowned
The female shriek the ruined peasant moan
The shout of captives from their chains unbound
But we weak minstrels of a laggard day
Skilled but to imitate an elder page
Timid and raptureless can we repay
The debt thou claim'st in this exhausted age
Thou givest our lyres a theme that might engage
Those that could send thy name o'er sea and land
While sea and land shall last for Homer rage
Ye mountains stern within whose rugged breast
The friends of Scottish freedom found repose
Ye torrents whose hoarse sounds have soothed their rest
Returning from the field of vanquished foes
Say have ye lost each wild majestic close
That erst the choir of Bards or Druids flung
What time their hymn of victory arose
Oh if your wilds such minstrelsy retain
As sure your changeful gales seem oft to say
When sweeping wild and sinking soft again
Like trumpet-jubilee or harp wild sway
If ye can echo such triumphant lay
Then lend the note to him has loved you long
Who pious gathered each tradition grey
For not till now how oft soe'er the task
Of truant verse hath lightened graver care
From Muse or Sylvan was he wont to ask
In phrase poetic inspiration fair
Careless he gave his numbers to the air
They came unsought for if applauses came
Nor for himself prefers he now the prayer
Hark from yon misty cairn their answer tost
Minstrel the fame of whose romantic lyre
Capricious-swelling now may soon be lost
Like the light flickering of a cottage fire
If to such task presumptuous thou aspire
Seek not from us the meed to warrior due
Age after age has gathered son to sire
Decayed our old traditionary lore
Save where the lingering fays renew their ring
By milkmaid seen beneath the hawthorn hoar
Or round the marge of Minchmore haunted spring
Save where their legends grey-haired shepherds sing
That now scarce win a listening ear but thine
Of feuds obscure and Border ravaging
No search romantic lands where the near Sun
Gives with unstinted boon ethereal flame
Where the rude villager his labour done
In verse spontaneous chants some favoured name
Whether Olalia charms his tribute claim
Her eye of diamond and her locks of jet
Or whether kindling at the deeds of Graeme
Explore those regions where the flinty crest
Of wild Nevada ever gleams with snows
Where in the proud Alhambra ruined breast
Barbaric monuments of pomp repose
Or where the banners of more ruthless foes
Than the fierce Moor float o'er Toledo fane
From whose tall towers even now the patriot throws
An anxious glance to spy upon the plain
There of Numantian fire a swarthy spark
Still lightens in the sunburnt native eye
The stately port slow step and visage dark
Still mark enduring pride and constancy
And if the glow of feudal chivalry
Beam not as once thy nobles' dearest pride
Iberia oft thy crestless peasantry
Have seen the plumed Hidalgo quit their side
And cherished still by that unchanging race
Are themes for minstrelsy more high than thine
Of strange tradition many a mystic trace
Legend and vision prophecy and sign
Where wonders wild of Arabesque combine
With Gothic imagery of darker shade
Forming a model meet for minstrel line
Go seek such theme the Mountain Spirit said
With filial awe I heard I heard and I obeyed
REARING their crests amid the cloudless skies
And darkly clustering in the pale moonlight
Toledo holy towers and spires arise
As from a trembling lake of silver white
Their mingled shadows intercept the sight
Of the broad burial-ground outstretched below
And nought disturbs the silence of the night
All sleeps in sullen shade or silver glow
All save the rushing swell of Teio tide
Or distant heard a courser neigh or tramp
Their changing rounds as watchful horsemen ride
To guard the limits of King Roderick camp
For through the river night-fog rolling damp
Was many a proud pavilion dimly seen
Which glimmered back against the moon fair lamp
Tissues of silk and silver twisted sheen
But of their Monarch person keeping ward
Since last the deep-mouthed bell of vespers tolled
The chosen soldiers of the royal guard
The post beneath the proud Cathedral hold
A band unlike their Gothic sires of old
Who for the cap of steel and iron mace
Bear slender darts and casques bedecked with gold
While silver-studded belts their shoulders grace
In the light language of an idle court
They murmured at their master long delay
And held his lengthened orisons in sport 
What will Don Roderick here till morning stay
To wear in shrift and prayer the night away
And are his hours in such dull penance past
For fair Florinda plundered charms to pay
Then to the east their weary eyes they cast
But far within Toledo Prelate lent
An ear of fearful wonder to the King
The silver lamp a fitful lustre sent
So long that sad confession witnessing
For Roderick told of many a hidden thing
Such as are lothly uttered to the air
When Fear Remorse and Shame the bosom wring
And Guilt his secret burden cannot bear
Full on the Prelate face and silver hair
The stream of failing light was feebly rolled
But Roderick visage though his head was bare
Was shadowed by his hand and mantle fold
While of his hidden soul the sins he told
Proud Alaric descendant could not brook
That mortal man his bearing should behold
Or boast that he had seen when Conscience shook
The old man faded cheek waxed yet more pale
As many a secret sad the King bewrayed
As sign and glance eked out the unfinished tale
When in the midst his faltering whisper stayed
Thus royal Witiza was slain he said
Yet holy Father deem not it was I
Thus still Ambition strives her crimes to shade 
Oh rather deem 'twas stern necessity
And if Florinda shrieks alarmed the air
If she invoked her absent sire in vain
And on her knees implored that I would spare
Yet reverend Priest thy sentence rash refrain
All is not as it seems the female train
Know by their bearing to disguise their mood
But Conscience here as if in high disdain
Sent to the Monarch cheek the burning blood 
O hardened offspring of an iron race
What of thy crimes Don Roderick shall I say
What alms or prayers or penance can efface
Murder dark spot wash treason stain away
For the foul ravisher how shall I pray
Who scarce repentant makes his crime his boast
How hope Almighty vengeance shall delay
Unless in mercy to yon Christian host
Then kindled the dark tyrant in his mood
And to his brow returned its dauntless gloom
And welcome then he cried be blood for blood
For treason treachery for dishonour doom
Yet will I know whence come they or by whom
Show for thou canst give forth the fated key
And guide me Priest to that mysterious room
Where if aught true in old tradition be
Ill-fated Prince recall the desperate word
Or pause ere yet the omen thou obey
Bethink yon spell-bound portal would afford
Never to former Monarch entrance-way
Nor shall it ever ope old records say
Save to a King the last of all his line
What time his empire totters to decay
And treason digs beneath her fatal mine
Prelate a Monarch fate brooks no delay
Lead on The ponderous key the old man took
And held the winking lamp and led the way
By winding stair dark aisle and secret nook
Then on an ancient gateway bent his look
And as the key the desperate King essayed
Low muttered thunders the Cathedral shook
And twice he stopped and twice new effort made
Long large and lofty was that vaulted hall
Roof walls and floor were all of marble stone
Of polished marble black as funeral pall
Carved o'er with signs and characters unknown
A paly light as of the dawning shone
Through the sad bounds but whence they could not spy
For window to the upper air was none
Yet by that light Don Roderick could descry
Grim sentinels against the upper wall
Of molten bronze two Statues held their place
Massive their naked limbs their stature tall
Their frowning foreheads golden circles grace
Moulded they seemed for kings of giant race
That lived and sinned before the avenging flood
This grasped a scythe that rested on a mace
This spread his wings for flight that pondering stood
Fixed was the right-hand Giant brazen look
Upon his brother glass of shifting sand
As if its ebb he measured by a book
Whose iron volume loaded his huge hand
In which was wrote of many a fallen land
Of empires lost and kings to exile driven
And o'er that pair their names in scroll expand 
Lo DESTINY and TIME to whom by Heaven
Even while they read the sand-glass wastes away
And as the last and lagging grains did creep
That right-hand Giant 'gan his club upsway
As one that startles from a heavy sleep
Full on the upper wall the mace sweep
At once descended with the force of thunder
And hurtling down at once in crumbled heap
The marble boundary was rent asunder
For they might spy beyond that mighty breach
Realms as of Spain in visioned prospect laid
Castles and towers in due proportion each
As by some skilful artist hand portrayed
Here crossed by many a wild Sierra shade
And boundless plains that tire the traveller eye
There rich with vineyard and with olive glade
Or deep-embrowned by forests huge and high
And here as erst upon the antique stage
Passed forth the band of masquers trimly led
In various forms and various equipage
While fitting strains the hearer fancy fed
So to sad Roderick eye in order spread
Successive pageants filled that mystic scene
Showing the fate of battles ere they bled
And issue of events that had not been
First shrilled an unrepeated female shriek 
It seemed as if Don Roderick knew the call
For the bold blood was blanching in his cheek 
Then answered kettle-drum and attabal
Gong-peal and cymbal-clank the ear appal
The Tecbir war-cry and the Lelie yell
Ring wildly dissonant along the hall
Needs not to Roderick their dread import tell 
They come they come I see the groaning lands
White with the turbans of each Arab horde
Swart Zaarah joins her misbelieving bands
Alla and Mahomet their battle-word
The choice they yield the Koran or the Sword 
See how the Christians rush to arms amain 
In yonder shout the voice of conflict roared
The shadowy hosts are closing on the plain 
By Heaven the Moors prevail the Christians yield
Their coward leader gives for flight the sign
The sceptred craven mounts to quit the field 
Is not yon steed Orelio Yes 'tis mine
But never was she turned from battle-line
Lo where the recreant spurs o'er stock and stone 
Curses pursue the slave and wrath divine
Rivers ingulph him Hush in shuddering tone
Just then a torrent crossed the flier course
The dangerous ford the Kingly Likeness tried
But the deep eddies whelmed both man and horse
Swept like benighted peasant down the tide
And the proud Moslemah spread far and wide
As numerous as their native locust band
Berber and Ismael sons the spoils divide
With naked scimitars mete out the land
Then rose the grated Harem to enclose
The loveliest maidens of the Christian line
Then menials to their misbelieving foes
Castile young nobles held forbidden wine
Then too the holy Cross salvation sign
By impious hands was from the altar thrown
And the deep aisles of the polluted shrine
Echoed for holy hymn and organ-tone
How fares Don Roderick E'en as one who spies
Flames dart their glare o'er midnight sable woof
And hears around his children piercing cries
And sees the pale assistants stand aloof
While cruel Conscience brings him bitter proof
His folly or his crime have caused his grief
And while above him nods the crumbling roof
He curses earth and Heaven himself in chief 
That scythe-armed Giant turned his fatal glass
And twilight on the landscape closed her wings
Far to Asturian hills the war-sounds pass
And in their stead rebeck or timbrel rings
And to the sound the bell-decked dancer springs
Bazars resound as when their marts are met
In tourney light the Moor his jerrid flings
And on the land as evening seemed to set
So passed that pageant Ere another came
The visionary scene was wrapped in smoke
Whose sulph'rous wreaths were crossed by sheets of flame
With every flash a bolt explosive broke
Till Roderick deemed the fiends had burst their yoke
And waved 'gainst heaven the infernal gonfalone
For War a new and dreadful language spoke
Never by ancient warrior heard or known
From the dim landscape rolled the clouds away 
The Christians have regained their heritage
Before the Cross has waned the Crescent ray
And many a monastery decks the stage
And lofty church and low-browed hermitage
The land obeys a Hermit and a Knight 
The Genii those of Spain for many an age
This clad in sackcloth that in armour bright
VALOUR was harnessed like a chief of old
Armed at all points and prompt for knightly gest
His sword was tempered in the Ebro cold
Morena eagle plume adorned his crest
The spoils of Afric lion bound his breast
Fierce he stepped forward and flung down his gage
As if of mortal kind to brave the best
Him followed his Companion dark and sage
Haughty of heart and brow the Warrior came
In look and language proud as proud might be
Vaunting his lordship lineage fights and fame
Yet was that barefoot Monk more proud than he
And as the ivy climbs the tallest tree
So round the loftiest soul his toils he wound
And with his spells subdued the fierce and free
Till ermined Age and Youth in arms renowned
And thus it chanced that VALOUR peerless knight
Who ne'er to King or Kaiser vailed his crest
Victorious still in bull-feast or in fight
Since first his limbs with mail he did invest
Stooped ever to that Anchoret behest
Nor reasoned of the right nor of the wrong
But at his bidding laid the lance in rest
And wrought fell deeds the troubled world along
Oft his proud galleys sought some new-found world
That latest sees the sun or first the morn
Still at that Wizard feet their spoils he hurled 
Ingots of ore from rich Potosi borne
Crowns by Caciques aigrettes by Omrahs worn
Wrought of rare gems but broken rent and foul
Idols of gold from heathen temples torn
Bedabbled all with blood With grisly scowl
Then did he bless the offering and bade make
Tribute to Heaven of gratitude and praise
And at his word the choral hymns awake
And many a hand the silver censer sways
But with the incense-breath these censers raise
Mix steams from corpses smouldering in the fire
The groans of prisoned victims mar the lays
And shrieks of agony confound the quire
Preluding light were strains of music heard
As once again revolved that measured sand
Such sounds as when for silvan dance prepared
Gay Xeres summons forth her vintage band
When for the light bolero ready stand
The mozo blithe with gay muchacha met
He conscious of his broidered cap and band
She of her netted locks and light corsette
And well such strains the opening scene became
For VALOUR had relaxed his ardent look
And at a lady feet like lion tame
Lay stretched full loath the weight of arms to brook
And softened BIGOTRY upon his book
Pattered a task of little good or ill
But the blithe peasant plied his pruning-hook
Whistled the muleteer o'er vale and hill
Grey Royalty grown impotent of toil
Let the grave sceptre slip his lazy hold
And careless saw his rule become the spoil
Of a loose Female and her minion bold
But peace was on the cottage and the fold
From Court intrigue from bickering faction far
Beneath the chestnut-tree Love tale was told
And to the tinkling of the light guitar
As that sea-cloud in size like human hand
When first from Carmel by the Tishbite seen
Came slowly overshadowing Israel land
A while perchance bedecked with colours sheen
While yet the sunbeams on its skirts had been
Limning with purple and with gold its shroud
Till darker folds obscured the blue serene
And blotted heaven with one broad sable cloud
Even so upon that peaceful scene was poured
Like gathering clouds full many a foreign band
And HE their Leader wore in sheath his sword
And offered peaceful front and open hand
Veiling the perjured treachery he planned
By friendship zeal and honour specious guise
Until he won the passes of the land
Then burst were honour oath and friendship ties
An iron crown his anxious forehead bore
And well such diadem his heart became
Who ne'er his purpose for remorse gave o'er
Or checked his course for piety or shame
Who trained a soldier deemed a soldier fame
Might flourish in the wreath of battles won
Though neither truth nor honour decked his name
Who placed by fortune on a Monarch throne
From a rude isle his ruder lineage came
The spark that from a suburb-hovel hearth
Ascending wraps some capital in flame
Hath not a meaner or more sordid birth
And for the soul that bade him waste the earth 
The sable land-flood from some swamp obscure
That poisons the glad husband-field with dearth
And by destruction bids its fame endure
Before that Leader strode a shadowy Form
Her limbs like mist her torch like meteor showed
With which she beckoned him through fight and storm
And all he crushed that crossed his desperate road
Nor thought nor feared nor looked on what he trode
Realms could not glut his pride blood could not slake
So oft as e'er she shook her torch abroad 
It was AMBITION bade her terrors wake
No longer now she spurned at mean revenge
Or stayed her hand for conquered foeman moan
As when the fates of aged Rome to change
By Caesar side she crossed the Rubicon
Nor joyed she to bestow the spoils she won
As when the banded powers of Greece were tasked
To war beneath the Youth of Macedon
No seemly veil her modern minion asked
That Prelate marked his march On banners blazed
With battles won in many a distant land
On eagle-standards and on arms he gazed
And hopest thou then he said thy power shall stand
Oh thou hast builded on the shifting sand
And thou hast tempered it with slaughter flood
And know fell scourge in the Almighty hand
Gore-moistened trees shall perish in the bud
The ruthless Leader beckoned from his train
A wan fraternal Shade and bade him kneel
And paled his temples with the crown of Spain
While trumpets rang and heralds cried Castile
Not that he loved him No In no man weal
Scarce in his own e'er joyed that sullen heart
Yet round that throne he bade his warriors wheel
That the poor puppet might perform his part
But on the Natives of that Land misused
Not long the silence of amazement hung
Nor brooked they long their friendly faith abused
For with a common shriek the general tongue
Exclaimed To arms and fast to arms they sprung
And VALOUR woke that Genius of the Land
Pleasure and ease and sloth aside he flung
As burst the awakening Nazarite his band
That Mimic Monarch now cast anxious eye
Upon the Satraps that begirt him round
Now doffed his royal robe in act to fly
And from his brow the diadem unbound
So oft so near the Patriot bugle wound
From Tarik walls to Bilboa mountains blown
These martial satellites hard labour found
To guard awhile his substituted throne 
From Alpuhara peak that bugle rung
And it was echoed from Corunna wall
Stately Seville responsive war-shot flung
Grenada caught it in her Moorish hall
Galicia bade her children fight or fall
Wild Biscay shook his mountain-coronet
Valencia roused her at the battle-call
And foremost still where Valour sons are met
But unappalled and burning for the fight
The Invaders march of victory secure
Skilful their force to sever or unite
And trained alike to vanquish or endure
Nor skilful less cheap conquest to ensure
Discord to breathe and jealousy to sow
To quell by boasting and by bribes to lure
While nought against them bring the unpractised foe
Proudly they march but oh they march not forth
By one hot field to crown a brief campaign
As when their Eagles sweeping through the North
Destroyed at every stoop an ancient reign
Far other fate had Heaven decreed for Spain
In vain the steel in vain the torch was plied
New Patriot armies started from the slain
High blazed the war and long and far and wide
Nor unatoned where Freedom foes prevail
Remained their savage waste With blade and brand
By day the Invaders ravaged hill and dale
But with the darkness the Guerilla band
Came like night tempest and avenged the land
And claimed for blood the retribution due
Probed the hard heart and lopped the murd'rous hand
And Dawn when o'er the scene her beams she threw
What minstrel verse may sing or tongue may tell
Amid the visioned strife from sea to sea
How oft the Patriot banners rose or fell
Still honoured in defeat as victory
For that sad pageant of events to be
Showed every form of fight by field and flood
Slaughter and Ruin shouting forth their glee
Beheld while riding on the tempest scud
Then Zaragoza blighted be the tongue
That names thy name without the honour due
For never hath the harp of Minstrel rung
Of faith so felly proved so firmly true
Mine sap and bomb thy shattered ruins knew
Each art of war extremity had room
Twice from thy half-sacked streets the foe withdrew
And when at length stern fate decreed thy doom
Yet raise thy head sad city Though in chains
Enthralled thou canst not be Arise and claim
Reverence from every heart where Freedom reigns
For what thou worshippest thy sainted dame
She of the Column honoured be her name
By all whate'er their creed who honour love
And like the sacred relics of the flame
That gave some martyr to the blessed above
Nor thine alone such wreck Gerona fair
Faithful to death thy heroes shall be sung
Manning the towers while o'er their heads the air
Swart as the smoke from raging furnace hung
Now thicker darkening where the mine was sprung
Now briefly lightened by the cannon flare
Now arched with fire-sparks as the bomb was flung
And reddening now with conflagration glare
While all around was danger strife and fear
While the earth shook and darkened was the sky
And wide Destruction stunned the listening ear
Appalled the heart and stupefied the eye 
Afar was heard that thrice-repeated cry
In which old Albion heart and tongue unite
Whene'er her soul is up and pulse beats high
Whether it hail the wine-cup or the fight
Don Roderick turned him as the shout grew loud 
A varied scene the changeful vision showed
For where the ocean mingled with the cloud
A gallant navy stemmed the billows broad
From mast and stern St George symbol flowed
Blent with the silver cross to Scotland dear
Mottling the sea their landward barges rowed
And flashed the sun on bayonet brand and spear
It was a dread yet spirit-stirring sight
The billows foamed beneath a thousand oars
Fast as they land the red-cross ranks unite
Legions on legions bright'ning all the shores
Then banners rise and cannon-signal roars
Then peals the warlike thunder of the drum
Thrills the loud fife the trumpet-flourish pours
And patriot hopes awake and doubts are dumb
A various host they came whose ranks display
Each mode in which the warrior meets the fight
The deep battalion locks its firm array
And meditates his aim the marksman light
Far glance the light of sabres flashing bright
Where mounted squadrons shake the echoing mead
Lacks not artillery breathing flame and night
Nor the fleet ordnance whirled by rapid steed
A various host from kindred realms they came
Brethren in arms but rivals in renown 
For yon fair bands shall merry England claim
And with their deeds of valour deck her crown
Hers their bold port and hers their martial frown
And hers their scorn of death in freedom cause
Their eyes of azure and their locks of brown
And the blunt speech that bursts without a pause
And oh loved warriors of the Minstrel land
Yonder your bonnets nod your tartans wave
The rugged form may mark the mountain band
And harsher features and a mien more grave
But ne'er in battlefield throbbed heart so brave
As that which beats beneath the Scottish plaid
And when the pibroch bids the battle rave
And level for the charge your arms are laid
Hark from yon stately ranks what laughter rings
Mingling wild mirth with war stern minstrelsy
His jest while each blithe comrade round him flings
And moves to death with military glee
Boast Erin boast them tameless frank and free
In kindness warm and fierce in danger known
Rough Nature children humorous as she
And HE yon Chieftain strike the proudest tone
Now on the scene Vimeira should be shown
On Talavera fight should Roderick gaze
And hear Corunna wail her battle won
And see Busaco crest with lightning blaze 
But shall fond fable mix with heroes' praise
Hath Fiction stage for Truth long triumphs room
And dare her wild flowers mingle with the bays
That claim a long eternity to bloom
Or may I give adventurous Fancy scope
And stretch a bold hand to the awful veil
That hides futurity from anxious hope
Bidding beyond it scenes of glory hail
And painting Europe rousing at the tale
Of Spain invaders from her confines hurled
While kindling nations buckle on their mail
And Fame with clarion-blast and wings unfurled
O vain though anxious is the glance I cast
Since Fate has marked futurity her own
Yet Fate resigns to worth the glorious past
The deeds recorded and the laurels won
Then though the Vault of Destiny be gone
King Prelate all the phantasms of my brain
Melted away like mist-wreaths in the sun
Yet grant for faith for valour and for Spain
One note of pride and fire a Patriot parting strain
Who shall command Estrella mountain-tide
Back to the source when tempest-chafed to hie
Who when Gascogne vexed gulf is raging wide
Shall hush it as a nurse her infant cry
His magic power let such vain boaster try
And when the torrent shall his voice obey
And Biscay whirlwinds list his lullaby
Let him stand forth and bar mine eagles' way
Else ne'er to stoop till high on Lisbon towers
They close their wings the symbol of our yoke
And their own sea hath whelmed yon red-cross powers
Thus on the summit of Alverca rock
To Marshal Duke and Peer Gaul Leader spoke
While downward on the land his legions press
Before them it was rich with vine and flock
And smiled like Eden in her summer dress 
And shall the boastful Chief maintain his word
Though Heaven hath heard the wailings of the land
Though Lusitania whet her vengeful sword
Though Britons arm and WELLINGTON command
No grim Busaco iron ridge shall stand
An adamantine barrier to his force
And from its base shall wheel his shattered band
As from the unshaken rock the torrent hoarse
Yet not because Alcoba mountain-hawk
Hath on his best and bravest made her food
In numbers confident yon Chief shall baulk
His Lord imperial thirst for spoil and blood
For full in view the promised conquest stood
And Lisbon matrons from their walls might sum
The myriads that had half the world subdued
And hear the distant thunders of the drum
Four moons have heard these thunders idly rolled
Have seen these wistful myriads eye their prey
As famished wolves survey a guarded fold 
But in the middle path a Lion lay
At length they move but not to battle-fray
Nor blaze yon fires where meets the manly fight
Beacons of infamy they light the way
Where cowardice and cruelty unite
O triumph for the Fiends of Lust and Wrath
Ne'er to be told yet ne'er to be forgot
What wanton horrors marked their wreckful path
The peasant butchered in his ruined cot
The hoary priest even at the altar shot
Childhood and age given o'er to sword and flame
Woman to infamy no crime forgot
By which inventive demons might proclaim
The rudest sentinel in Britain born
With horror paused to view the havoc done
Gave his poor crust to feed some wretch forlorn
Wiped his stern eye then fiercer grasped his gun
Nor with less zeal shall Britain peaceful son
Exult the debt of sympathy to pay
Riches nor poverty the tax shall shun
Nor prince nor peer the wealthy nor the gay
But thou unfoughten wilt thou yield to Fate
Minion of Fortune now miscalled in vain
Can vantage-ground no confidence create
Marcella pass nor Guarda mountain-chain
Vainglorious fugitive yet turn again
Behold where named by some prophetic Seer
Flows Honour Fountain as foredoomed the stain
From thy dishonoured name and arms to clear 
Yet ere thou turn'st collect each distant aid
Those chief that never heard the lion roar
Within whose souls lives not a trace portrayed
Of Talavera or Mondego shore
Marshal each band thou hast and summon more
Of war fell stratagems exhaust the whole
Rank upon rank squadron on squadron pour
Legion on legion on thy foeman roll
O vainly gleams with steel Agueda shore
Vainly thy squadrons hide Assuava plain
And front the flying thunders as they roar
With frantic charge and tenfold odds in vain
And what avails thee that for CAMERON slain
Wild from his plaided ranks the yell was given 
Vengeance and grief gave mountain-range the rein
And at the bloody spear-point headlong driven
Go baffled boaster teach thy haughty mood
To plead at thine imperious master throne
Say thou hast left his legions in their blood
Deceived his hopes and frustrated thine own
Say that thine utmost skill and valour shown
By British skill and valour were outvied
Last say thy conqueror was WELLINGTON
And if he chafe be his own fortune tried 
But you ye heroes of that well-fought day
How shall a bard unknowing and unknown
His meed to each victorious leader pay
Or bind on every brow the laurels won
Yet fain my harp would wake its boldest tone
O'er the wide sea to hail CADOGAN brave
And he perchance the minstrel-note might own
Mindful of meeting brief that Fortune gave
Yes hard the task when Britons wield the sword
To give each Chief and every field its fame
Hark Albuera thunders BERESFORD
And Red Barosa shouts for dauntless GRAEME
O for a verse of tumult and of flame
Bold as the bursting of their cannon sound
To bid the world re-echo to their fame
For never upon gory battle-ground
O who shall grudge him Albuera bays
Who brought a race regenerate to the field
Roused them to emulate their fathers' praise
Tempered their headlong rage their courage steeled
And raised fair Lusitania fallen shield
And gave new edge to Lusitania sword
And taught her sons forgotten arms to wield 
Shivered my harp and burst its every chord
Not on that bloody field of battle won
Though Gaul proud legions rolled like mist away
Was half his self-devoted valour shown 
He gaged but life on that illustrious day
But when he toiled those squadrons to array
Who fought like Britons in the bloody game
Sharper than Polish pike or assagay
He braved the shafts of censure and of shame
Nor be his praise o'erpast who strove to hide
Beneath the warrior vest affection wound
Whose wish Heaven for his country weal denied
Danger and fate he sought but glory found
From clime to clime where'er war trumpets sound
The wanderer went yet Caledonia still
Thine was his thought in march and tented ground
He dreamed 'mid Alpine cliffs of Athole hill
O hero of a race renowned of old
Whose war-cry oft has waked the battle-swell
Since first distinguished in the onset bold
Wild sounding when the Roman rampart fell
By Wallace' side it rung the Southron knell
Alderne Kilsythe and Tibber owned its fame
Tummell rude pass can of its terrors tell
But ne'er from prouder field arose the name
But all too long through seas unknown and dark
With Spenser parable I close my tale
By shoal and rock hath steered my venturous bark
And landward now I drive before the gale
And now the blue and distant shore I hail
And nearer now I see the port expand
And now I gladly furl my weary sail
And as the prow light touches on the strand
Why am I loth to leave this earthly scene
Have I so found it full of pleasing charms
Some drops of joy with draughts of ill between 
Some gleams of sunshine 'mid renewing storms
Is it departing pangs my soul alarms
Or death unlovely dreary dark abode
For guilt for guilt my terrors are in arms
I tremble to approach an angry God
Fain would I say Forgive my foul offence
Fain promise never more to disobey
But should my Author health again dispense
Again I might desert fair virtue way
Again in folly part might go astray
Again exalt the brute and sink the man
Then how should I for heavenly mercy pray
Who act so counter heavenly mercy plan
O Thou great Governor of all below
If I may dare a lifted eye to Thee
Thy nod can make the tempest cease to blow
Or still the tumult of the raging sea
With that controlling pow'r assist ev'n me
Those headlong furious passions to confine
For all unfit I feel my pow'rs to be
To rule their torrent in th' allowed line
Cocks wake the early morn with many a crow
Loud-striking village clock has counted four
The labouring rustic hears his restless foe
And weary of his pains complaining sore
Hobbles to fetch his horses from the moor
Some busy 'gin to teem the loaded corn
Which night throng'd round the barn becrowded door
Such plenteous scenes the farmer yard adorn
Such noisy busy toils now mark the Harvest Morn
The bird-boy pealing horn is loudly blow'd
The waggons jostle on with rattling sound
And hogs and geese now throng the dusty road
Grunting and gabbling in contention round
The barley ears that litter on the ground
What printing traces mark the waggon way
What busy bustling wakens echo round
How drive the sun warm beams the mist away
His scythe the mower o'er his shoulder leans
And whetting jars with sharp and tinkling sound
Then sweeps again 'mong corn and crackling beans
And swath by swath flops lengthening o'er the ground
While 'neath some friendly heap snug shelter'd round
From spoiling sun lies hid the heart delight
And hearty soaks oft hand the bottle round
Their toils pursuing with redoubled might 
Upon the waggon now with eager bound
The lusty picker whirls the rustling sheaves
Or resting ponderous creaking fork aground
Boastful at once whole shocks of barley heaves
The loading boy revengeful inly grieves
To find his unmatch'd strength and power decay
The barley horn his garments interweaves
Smarting and sweating 'neath the sultry day
A motley group the clearing field surround
Sons of Humanity oh ne'er deny
The humble gleaner entrance in your ground
Winter sad cold and Poverty are nigh
Grudge not from Providence the scant supply
You'll never miss it from your ample store
Who gives denial harden'd hungry hound 
May never blessings crowd his hated door
Ah lovely Emma mingling with the rest
Thy beauties blooming in low life unseen
Thy rosy cheeks thy sweetly swelling breast
But ill it suits thee in the stubs to glean
O Poverty how basely you demean
The imprison'd worth your rigid fates confine
Not fancied charms of an Arcadian queen
So sweet as Emma real beauties shine
The sun increasing heat now mounted high
Refreshment must recruit exhausted power
The waggon stops the busy tool thrown by
And 'neath a shock enjoy'd the bevering hour
The bashful maid sweet health engaging flower
Lingering behind o'er rake still blushing bends
And when to take the horn fond swains implore
With feign'd excuses its dislike pretends
O Rural Life what charms thy meanness hide
What sweet descriptions bards disdain to sing
What loves what graces on thy plains abide
Oh could I soar me on the Muse wing
What rifled charms should my researches bring
Pleas'd would I wander where these charms reside
Of rural sports and beauties would I sing
Those beauties Wealth which you in vain deride
Welcome old Comrade peeping once again
Our meeting 'minds me of a pleasant hour
Spring pencil pinks thee in that blushy stain
And Summer glistens in thy tinty flower
Hail Beauty Gem disdaining time nor place
Carelessly creeping on the dunghill side
Demeanour softness in thy crimpled face
Decks thee in beauties unattain'd by pride
Hail 'Venturer once again that fearless here
Encampeth on the hoar hill sunny side
Spring early messenger thou'rt doubly dear
And winter frost by thee is well supplied
Now winter frowns shall cease their pelting rage
But winter woes I need not tell to thee
Far better luck thy visits well presage
And be it thine and mine that luck to see
Ah may thy smiles confirm the hopes they tell
To see thee frost-bit I'd be griev'd at heart
I meet thee happy and I wish thee well
Till ripening summer summons us to part
Then like old mates or two who've neighbours been
We'll part in hopes to meet another year
And o'er thy exit from this changing scene
We'll mix our wishes in a tokening tear
Ah little did I think in time that past
By summer burnt or numb'd by winter blast
Delving the ditch a livelihood to earn
Or lumping corn out in a dusty barn
With aching bones returning home at night
And sitting down with weary hand to write
Ah little did I think as then unknown
Those artless rhymes I even blush'd to own
Would be one day applauded and approv'd
By learning notic'd and by genius lov'd
God knows my hopes were many but my pain
Damp'd all the prospects which I hop'd to gain
I hardly dar'd to hope Thou corner-chair
In which I've oft slung back in deep despair
Hadst thou expression thou couldst easy tell
The pains and all that I have known too well
'Twould be but sorrow tale yet still 'twould be
A tale of truth and passing sweet to me
How oft upon my hand I've laid my head
And thought how poverty deform'd our shed
Look'd on each parent face I fain had cheer'd
Where sorrow triumph'd and pale want appear'd
And sigh'd and hop'd and wish'd some day would come
When I might bring a blessing to their home 
That toil and merit comforts had in store
To bid the tear defile their cheeks no more
Who that has feelings would not wish to be
A friend to parents such as mine to me
Who in distress broke their last crust in twain
And though want pinch'd the remnant broke again
And still if craving of their scanty bread
Gave their last mouthful that I might be fed
Nor for their own wants tear-drops follow'd free
Worse anguish stung they had no more for me
And now hope sun is looking brighter out
And spreading thin the clouds of fear and doubt
That long in gloomy sad suspense to me
Hid the long-waited smiles I wish'd to see
And now my parents helping you is sweet 
The rudest havoc fortune could complete
A piteous couple little blest with friends
Where pain and poverty have had their ends
I'll be thy crutch my father lean on me
Weakness knits stubborn while its bearing thee
And hard shall fall the shock of fortune frown
To eke thy sorrows ere it breaks me down
My mother too thy kindness shall be met
And ere I'm able will I pay the debt
For what thou'st done and what gone through for me
My last-earn'd sixpence will I break with thee
And when my dwindled sum won't more divide
Then take it all to fate I'll leave the rest
In helping thee I'll always feel a pride
Nor think I'm happy till ye both are blest
How oft on Sundays when I'd time to tramp
My rambles led me to a gipsy camp
Where the real effigy of midnight hags
With tawny smoked flesh and tatter'd rags
Uncouth-brimm'd hat and weather-beaten cloak
'Neath the wild shelter of a knotty oak
Along the greensward uniforming pricks
Her pliant bending hazel arching sticks
While round-topt bush or briar-entangled hedge
Where flag-leaves spring beneath or ramping sedge
Keep off the bothering bustle of the wind
And give the best retreat she hopes to find
How oft I've bent me o'er her fire and smoke
To hear her gibberish tale so quaintly spoke
While the old Sybil forg'd her boding clack
Twin imps the meanwhile bawling at her back
Oft on my hand her magic coin been struck
And hoping chink she talk'd of morts of luck
And still as boyish hopes did first agree
Mingled with fears to drop the fortune fee
I never fail'd to gain the honours sought
And Squire and Lord were purchas'd with a groat
But as man unbelieving taste came round
She furious stampt her shoeless foot aground
Wip'd bye her soot-black hair with clenching fist
While through her yellow teeth the spittle hist
Swearing by all her lucky powers of fate
Which like as footboys on her actions wait
That fortune scale should to my sorrow turn
And I one day the rash neglect should mourn
That good to bad should change and I should be
Lost to this world and all eternity
That poor as Job I should remain unblest 
Alas for fourpence how my die is cast
Of not a hoarded farthing be possest
And when all done be shov'd to hell at last
O painted clouds sweet beauties of the sky
How have I view'd your motion and your rest
When like fleet hunters ye have left mine eye
In your thin gauze of woolly-fleecing drest
Or in your threaten'd thunder grave black vest
Like black deep waters slowly moving by
Awfully striking the spectator breast
With your Creator dread sublimity
As admiration mutely views your storms
And I do love to see you idly lie
Painted by heav'n as various as your forms
Pausing upon the eastern mountain high
As morn awakes with spring wood-harmony
And sweeter still when in your slumbers sooth
You hang the western arch o'er day proud eye
Still as the even-pool uncurv'd and smooth
My gazing soul has look'd most placidly
And higher still devoutly wish'd to strain
To wipe your shrouds and sky blue blinders by
With all the warmness of a moon-struck brain 
To catch a glimpse of Him who bids you reign
And view the dwelling of all majesty
The beating snow-clad bell with sounding dead
Hath clanked four the woodman wak'd again
And as he leaves his comfortable bed
Dithers to view the rimy feather'd pane
And shrugs and wishes but 'tis all in vain
The bed warm comforts he most now forego
His family that oft till eight hath lain
Without his labour wage could not do so
The early winter morn is dark as pitch
The wary wife from tinder brought at night
With flint and steel and may a sturdy twitch
Sits up in bed to strike her man a light
And as the candle shows the rapturous sight
Aside his wife his rosy sleeping boy
He smacks his lips with exquisite delight
With all a father feelings father joy
His breakfast water-porridge humble food
A barley-crust he in his wallet flings
On this he toils and labours in the wood
And chops his faggot twists his band and sings
As happily as princes and as kings
With all their luxury and blest is he
Can but the little which his labour brings
Far o'er the dreary fields the woodland lies
Rough is the journey which he daily goes
The woolly clouds that hang the frowning skies
Keep winnowing down their drifting sleet and snows
And thro' his doublet keen the north wind blows
While hard as iron the cemented ground
And smooth as glass the glibbed pool is froze
His nailed boots with clenching tread rebound
The woods how gloomy in a winter morn
The crows and ravens even cease to croak
The little birds sit chittering on the thorn
The pies scarce chatter when they leave the oak
Startled from slumber by the woodman stroke
The milk-maid song is drown'd in gloomy care
And while the village chimneys curl their smoke
She milks and blows and hastens to be there
The quirking rabbit scarcely leaves her hole
But rolls in torpid slumbers all the day
The fox is loth to 'gin a long patrol
And scouts the woods content with meaner prey
The hare so frisking timid once and gay
'Hind the dead thistle hurkles from the view
Nor scarce is scar'd though in the traveller way
Though waffling curs and shepherd-dogs pursue
What different changes winter frowns supply
The clown no more a loitering hour beguiles
Nor gaping tracks the clouds along the sky
As when buds blossom and the warm sun smiles
And Lawrence wages bids on hills and stiles
Banks stiles and flowers and skies no longer charm
Deep drifting snow each summer-seat defiles
With hasty blundering step and folded arm
The shepherd haunts no more his spreading oak
Nor on the sloping pond-head lies at lair
The arbour he once wattled up is broke
And left unworthy of his future care
The ragged plundering stickers have been there
And pilfer'd it away he passes by
His summer dwelling desolate and bare
And ne'er so much as turns a conscious eye
The scene is cloth'd in snow from morn till night
The woodman loth his chilly tools to seize
The crows unroosting as he comes in sight
Shake down the feathery burden from the trees
To look at things around he fit to freeze
Scar'd from her perch the fluttering pheasant flies
His hat and doublet whiten by degrees
He quakes looks round and pats his hands and sighs
The robin tamest of the feather'd race
Soon as he hears the woodman sounding chops
With ruddy bosom and a simple face
Around his old companion fearless hops
And there for hours in pleas'd attention stops
The woodman heart is tender and humane
And at his meals he many a crumble drops
Thanks to thy generous feelings gentle swain
The woodman gladly views the closing day
To see the sun drop down behind the wood
Sinking in clouds deep blue or misty grey
Round as a football and as red as blood
The pleasing prospect does his heart much good
Though 'tis not his such beauties to admire
He hastes to fill his bags with billet-wood
Well-pleas'd from the chill prospect to retire
And soon as dusky even hovers round
And the white frost 'gins crizzle pond and brook
The little family are glimpsing round
And from the door dart many a wistful look
The supper ready stewing on the hook
And every foot that clampers down the street
Is for the coming father step mistook
O'erjoy'd are they when he their eyes doth meet
I think I see him seated in his chair
Taking the bellows up the fire to blow
I think I hear him joke and chatter there
Telling his children news they wish to know
With leather leggings on that stopt the snow
And broad-brimm'd hat uncouthly shapen round
Nor would he I'll be bound if it were so
Give twopence for the chance could it be found
The woodman smokes the brats in mirth and glee
And artless prattle even hour beguile
While love last pledge runs scrambling up his knee
The nightly comfort from his weary toil
His chuff cheeks dimpling in a fondling smile
He claims his kiss and says his scraps of prayer
Begging his daddy pretty song the while
Playing with his jacket-buttons and his hair 
And as most labourers knowingly pretend
By certain signs to judge the weather right
As oft from Noah ark great floods descend
And buried moons foretell great storms at night
In such-like things the woodman took delight
And ere he went to bed would always ken
Whether the sky was gloom'd or stars shone bright
Then went to comfort arms till morn and then
And ere he slept he always breath'd a prayer
I thank Thee Lord that Thou to-day didst give
Sufficient strength to toil and blest Thy care
And thank Thee still for what I may receive
And O Almighty God while I still live
Ere my eyes open on the last day sun
Prepare Thou me this wicked world to leave
And fit my passage ere my race is run
Holland to thee this humble ballad sent
Who for the poor man welfare oft hast pray'd
Whose tongue did ne'er belie its good intent
Preacher as well in practice as in trade 
Alas too often money business made
O may the wretch that still in darkness living
The Bible comforts hear by thee display'd
And many a woodman family forgiven
The sun now sinks behind the woodland green
And twittering spangles glow the leaves between
So bright and dazzling on the eye it plays
As if noon heat had kindled to a blaze
But soon it dims in red and heavier hues
And shows wild fancy cheated in her views
A mist-like moisture rises from the ground
And deeper blueness stains the distant round
The eye each moment as it gazes o'er
Still loses objects which it mark'd before
The woods at distance changing like to clouds
And spire-points croodling under evening shrouds
Till forms of things and hues of leaf and flower
In deeper shadows as by magic power
With light and all in scarce-perceiv'd decay
Put on mild evening sober garb of grey
Now in the sleepy gloom that blackens round
Dies many a lulling hum of rural sound
From cottage door farm-yard and dusty lane
Where home the cart-house tolters with the swain
Or padded holm where village boys resort
Bawling enraptur'd o'er their evening sport
Till night awakens superstition dread
And drives them prisoners to a restless bed
Thrice happy eve of days no more to me
Whoever thought such change belong'd to thee
When like to boys whom now thy gloom surrounds
I chas'd the stag or play'd at fox-and-hounds
Or wander'd down the lane with many a mate
To play at see-saw on the pasture-gate
Or on the threshold of some cottage sat
To watch the flittings of the shrieking bat
Who seemly pleas'd to mock our treacherous view
Would even swoop and touch us as he flew
And vainly still our hopes to entertain
Would stint his route and circle us again 
Till wearied out with many a coaxing call
Which boyish superstition loves to bawl
His shrill song shrieking he betook to flight
And left us puzzled in short-sighted night
Those days have fled me as from them they steal
And I've felt losses they must shortly feel
But sure such ends make every bosom sore
To think of pleasures we must meet no more
Now from the pasture milking-maidens come
With each a swain to bear the burden home
Who often coax them on their pleasant way
To soodle longer out in love delay
While on a mole-hill or a resting stile
The simple rustics try their arts the while
With glegging smiles and hopes and fears between
Snatching a kiss to open what they mean
And all the utmost that their tongues can do
The honey'd words which nature learns to woo
The wild-flower sweets of language love and dear
With warmest utterings meet each maiden ear
Who as by magic smit she knows not why
From the warm look that waits a wish'd reply
Droops fearful down in love delightful swoon
As slinks the blossom from the suns of noon
While sighs half-smother'd from the throbbing breast
And broken words sweet trembling o'er the rest
And cheeks in blushes burning turn'd aside
Betray the plainer what she strives to hide
The amorous swain sees through the feign'd disguise
Discerns the fondness she at first denies
And with all passions love and truth can move
Urges more strong the simpering maid to love
More freely using toying ways to win 
Tokens that echo from the soul within 
Her soft hand nipping that with ardour burns
And timid gentlier presses its returns
Then stealing pins with innocent deceit
To loose the 'kerchief from its envied seat
Then unawares her bonnet he'll untie
Her dark-brown ringlets wiping gently by
To steal a kiss in seemly feign'd disguise
As love yields kinder taken by surprise
While nearly conquer'd she less disapproves
And owns at last mid tears and sighs she loves
With sweetest feelings that this world bestows
Now each to each their inmost souls disclose
Vow to be true and to be truly ta'en
Repeat their loves and vow it o'er again
And pause at loss of language to proclaim
Those purest pleasures yet without a name
And while in highest ecstacy of bliss
The shepherd holds her yielding hand in his
He turns to heaven to witness what he feels
And silent shows what want of words conceals
Then ere the parting moments hustle nigh
And night in deeper dye his curtain dips
Till next day evening glads the anxious eye
He swears his truth and seals it on her lips
At even hour the truce of toil 'tis sweet
The sons of labour at their ease to meet
On piled bench beside the cottage door
Made up of mud and stones and sodded o'er
Where rustic taste at leisure trimly weaves
The rose and straggling woodbine to the eaves 
And on the crowded spot that pales enclose
The white and scarlet daisy rears in rows 
Training the trailing peas in bunches neat
Perfuming evening with a luscious sweet 
And sun-flowers planting for their gilded show
That scale the window lattice ere they blow
Then sweet to habitants within the sheds
Peep through the diamond pane their golden heads
Or at the shop where ploughs and harrows lie
Well-known to every child that passes by
From shining fragments littering on the floor
And branded letter burnt upon the door
Where meddling boys the torment of the street
In hard-burnt cinders ready weapons meet
To pelt the martins 'neath the eves at rest
That oft are wak'd to mourn a ruin'd nest
Or sparrows that delight their nests to leave
In dust to flutter at the cool of eve
For such-like scenes the gossip leaves her home
And sons of labour light their pipes and come
To talk of wages whether high or low
And mumble news that still as secrets go
When heedless then to all the rest may say
The beckoning lover nods the maid away
And at a distance many an hour they seem
In jealous whisperings o'er their pleasing theme
While children round them teasing sports prolong
To twirl the top or bounce the hoop along
Or shout across the street their one catch all
Or prog the hous'd bee from the cotter wall
Now at the parish cottage wall'd with dirt
Where all the cumber-grounds of life resort
From the low door that bows two props between
Some feeble tottering dame surveys the scene
By them reminded of the long-lost day
When she herself was young and went to play
And turning to the painful scenes again
The mournful changes she has meet since then
Her aching heart the contrast moves so keen
E'en sighs a wish that life had never been
Still vainly sinning while she strives to pray
Half-smother'd discontent pursues its way
In whispering Providence how blest she'd been
If life last troubles she'd escap'd unseen
If ere want sneak'd for grudg'd support from pride
She had but shar'd of childhood joys and died
And as to talk some passing neighbours stand
And shove their box within her tottering hand
She turns from echoes of her younger years
And nips the portion of her snuff with tears
On Sunday mornings freed from hard employ
How oft I mark the mischievous young boy
With anxious haste his pole and lines provide
For make-shifts oft crook'd pins to thread were tied
And delve his knife with wishes ever warm
In rotten dunghills for the grub and worm
The harmless treachery of his hooks to bait
Tracking the dewy grass with many a mate
To seek the brook that down the meadows glides
Where the grey willow shadows by its sides
Where flag and reed in wild disorder spread
And bending bulrush bows its taper head
And just above the surface of the floods
Where water-lilies mount their snowy buds
On whose broad swimming leaves of glossy green
The shining dragon-fly is often seen
Where hanging thorns with roots wash'd bare appear
That shield the moor-hen nest from year to year
While crowding osiers mingling wild among
Prove snug asylums to her brood when young
Who when surpris'd by foes approaching near
Plunge 'neath the weeping boughs and disappear
There far from terrors that the parson brings
Or church bell hearing when its summons rings
Half hid in meadow-sweet and keck high flowers
In lonely sport they spend the Sunday hours
Though ill supplied for fishing seem the brook
That breaks the mead in many a stinted crook
Oft choak'd in weeds and foil'd to find a road
The choice retirement of the snake and toad
Then lost in shallows dimpling restlessly
In fluttering struggles murmuring to be free 
O'er gravel stones its depth can scarcely hide
It runs remnant of its broken tide
Till seemly weary of each choak'd control
It rests collected in some gulled hole
Scoop'd by the sudden floods when winter snow
Melts in confusion by a hasty thaw
There bent in hopeful musings on the brink
They watch their floating corks that seldom sink
Save when a wary roach or silver bream
Nibbles the worm as passing up the stream
Just urging expectation hopes to stay
To view the dodging cork then slink away
Still hopes keep burning with untir'd delight
Still wobbling curves keep wavering like a bite
If but the breezy wind their floats should spring
And move the water with a troubling ring
A captive fish still fills the anxious eyes
And willow-wicks lie ready for the prize
Till evening gales awaken damp and chill
And nip the hopes that morning suns instil
And resting flies have tired their gauzy wing
Nor longer tempt the watching fish to spring
Who at the worm no nibbles more repeat
But lunge from night in sheltering flag-retreat
Then disappointed in their day employ
They seek amusement in a feebler joy
Short is the sigh for fancies prov'd untrue
With humbler hopes still pleasure they pursue
Where the rude oak-bridge scales the narrow pass
Half hid in rustling reeds and scrambling grass
Or stepping stones stride o'er the narrow sloughs
Which maidens daily cross to milk their cows
There they in artless glee for minnows run
And wade and dabble past the setting sun
Chasing the struttle o'er the shallow tide
And flat stones turning up where gudgeons hide
All former hopes their ill success delay'd
In this new change they fancy well repaid
And thus they wade and chatter o'er their joys
Till night unlook'd-for young success destroys
Drives home the sons of solitude and streams
And stops uncloy'd hope ever-fresh'ning dreams
They then like school-boys that at truant play
In sloomy fear lounge on their homeward way
And inly tremble as they gain the town
Where chastisement awaits with many a frown
And hazel twigs in readiness prepar'd
For their long absence brings a meet reward
Now Summer is in flower and Nature hum
Is never silent round her bounteous bloom
Insects as small as dust have never done
With glitt'ring dance and reeling in the sun
And green wood-fly and blossom-haunting bee
Are never weary of their melody
Round field and hedge flowers in full glory twine
Large bind-weed bells wild hop and streak'd woodbine
That lift athirst their slender throated flowers
Agape for dew-fall and for honey showers
These o'er each bush in sweet disorder run
And spread their wild hues to the sultry sun
The mottled spider at eve leisure weaves
His webs of silken lace on twigs and leaves
Which ev'ry morning meet the poet eye
Like fairies' dew-wet dresses hung to dry
The wheat swells into ear and hides below
The May-month wild flowers and their gaudy show
Leaving a school-boy height in snugger rest
The leveret seat and lark and partridge nest
The mowers now bend o'er the beaded grass
Where oft the gipsy hungry journeying ass
Will turn his wishes from the meadow paths
List'ning the rustle of the falling swaths
The ploughman sweats along the fallow vales
And down the sun-crack'd furrow slowly trails
Oft seeking when athirst the brook supply
Where brushing eagerly the bushes by
For coolest water he disturbs the rest
Of ring-dove brooding o'er its idle nest
The shepherd leisure hours are over now
No more he loiters 'neath the hedge-row bough
On shadow-pillowed banks and lolling stile
The wilds must lose their summer friend awhile
With whistle barking dogs and chiding scold
He drives the bleating sheep from fallow fold
To wash-pools where the willow shadows lean
Dashing them in their stained coats to clean
Then on the sunny sward when dry again
He brings them homeward to the clipping pen
Of hurdles form'd where elm or sycamore
Shut out the sun or to some threshing-floor
There with the scraps of songs and laugh and tale
He lightens annual toil while merry ale
Goes round and glads some old man heart to praise
The threadbare customs of his early days
How the high bowl was in the middle set
At breakfast time when clippers yearly met
Fill'd full of furmety where dainty swum
The streaking sugar and the spotting plum
The maids could never to the table bring
The bowl without one rising from the ring
To lend a hand who if 'twere ta'en amiss
Would sell his kindness for a stolen kiss
The large stone pitcher in its homely trim
And clouded pint-horn with its copper rim
Were there from which were drunk with spirits high
Healths of the best the cellar could supply
While sung the ancient swains in uncouth rhymes
Songs that were pictures of the good old times
Thus will the old man ancient ways bewail
Till toiling shears gain ground upon the tale
And break it off for now the timid sheep
His fleece shorn off starts with a fearful leap
Shaking his naked skin with wond'ring joys
While others are brought in by sturdy boys
Though fashion haughty frown hath thrown aside
Half the old forms simplicity supplied
Yet there are some pride winter deigns to spare
Left like green ivy when the trees are bare
And now when shearing of the flocks is done
Some ancient customs mix'd with harmless fun
Crown the swain merry toils The timid maid
Pleased to be praised and yet of praise afraid
Seeks the best flowers not those of woods and fields
But such as every farmer garden yields 
Fine cabbage-roses painted like her face
The shining pansy trimm'd with golden lace
The tall topp'd larkheels feather'd thick with flowers
The woodbine climbing o'er the door in bowers
The London tufts of many a mottled hue
The pale pink pea and monkshood darkly blue
The white and purple gilliflowers that stay
Ling'ring in blossom summer half away
The single blood-walls of a luscious smell
Old-fashion'd flowers which housewives love so well
The columbine stone-blue or deep night-brown
Their honeycomb-like blossoms hanging down
Each cottage-garden fond adopted child
Though heaths still claim them where they yet grow wild
With marjoram knots sweet-brier and ribbon-grass
And lavender the choice of ev'ry lass
And sprigs of lad's-love all familiar names
Which every garden through the village claims
These the maid gathers with a coy delight
And ties them up in readiness for night
Then gives to ev'ry swain 'tween love and shame
Her clipping-posies as his yearly claim
He rises to obtain the custom'd kiss 
With stifled smiles half hankering after bliss
She shrinks away and blushing calls it rude
Yet turns to smile and hopes to be pursued
While one to whom the hint may be applied
Follows to gain it and is not denied
The rest the loud laugh raise to make it known 
She blushes silent and will not disown
Thus ale and song and healths and merry ways
Keep up a shadow still of former days
But the old beechen bowl that once supplied
The feast of furmety is thrown aside
And the old freedom that was living then
When masters made them merry with their men
When all their coats alike were russet brown
And his rude speech was vulgar as their own 
All this is past and soon will pass away
The time-torn remnant of the holiday
Muse of the Fields oft have I said farewell
To thee my boon companion loved so long
And hung thy sweet harp in the bushy dell
For abler hands to wake an abler song
Much did I fear my homage did thee wrong
Yet loth to leave as oft I turned again
And to its wires mine idle hands would cling
Torturing it into song It may be vain
Yet still I try ere Fancy droops her wing
Muse of the Pasture Brooks on thy calm sea
Of poesy I've sailed and though the will
To speed were greater than my prowess be
I've ventur'd with much fear of usage ill
Yet more of joy Though timid be my skill
As not to dare the depths of mightier streams
Yet rocks abide in shallow ways and I
Have much of fear to mingle with my dreams
Yet lovely Muse I still believe thee by
Muse of the Cottage Hearth oft did I tell
My hopes to thee nor feared to plead in vain
But felt around my heart thy witching spell
That bade me as thy worshipper remain
I did so and still worship Oh again
Smile on my offerings and so keep them green
Bedeck my fancies like the clouds of even
Mingling all hues which thou from heaven dost glean
To me a portion of thy power be given
For thee in youth I culled the simple flower
That on thy bosom gained a sweeter hue
And took thy hand along life sunny hour
Meeting the sweetest joys that ever grew
More friends were needless and my foes were few
Though freedom then be deemed as rudeness now
And what once won thy praise now meets disdain
Yet the last wreath I braided for thy brow
Thy smiles did so commend it made me vain
With thee the spirit of departed years
Wakes that sweet voice which time hath rendered dumb
And freshens like to spring loves hopes and fears
That in my bosom found an early home
Wooing the heart to ecstasy I come
To thee when sick of care of joy bereft
Seeking the pleasures that are found in bloom
O happy hopes that Time hath only left
Around the haunts where thou didst erst sojourn
With thee the raptures of life early day
Appear and all that pleased me when a boy
Though pains and cares have torn the best away
And winter creeps between us to destroy
Do thou commend the recompence is joy
The tempest of the heart shall soon be calm
Though sterner Truth against my dreams rebel
Hope feels success and all my spirits warm
To strike with happier mood thy simple shell
Still sweet Enchantress youth strong feelings move
That from thy presence their existence took 
The innocent idolatry and love
Paying thee worship in each secret nook
That fancied friends in tree and flower and brook
Shaped clouds to angels and beheld them smile
And heard commending tongues in ev'ry wind
Life grosser fancies did these dreams defile
Yet not entirely root them from the mind
Aye I have heard thee in the summer wind
As if commending what I sung to thee
Aye I have seen thee on a cloud reclined
Kindling my fancies into poesy
I saw thee smile and took the praise to me
In beauties past all beauty thou wert drest
I thought the very clouds around thee knelt
I saw the sun to linger in the west
Paying thee worship and as eve did melt
Sweeter than flowers on beauty bosom hung
Sweeter than dreams of happiness above
Sweeter than themes by lips of beauty sung
Are the young fancies of a poet love
When round his thoughts thy trancing visions move
In floating melody no notes may sound
The world is all forgot and past his care
While on thy harp thy fingers lightly bound
As winning him its melody to share
E'en now my heart leaps out from grief and all
The gloom thrown round by Care o'ershading wing
E'en now those sunny visions to recall
Like to a bird I quit dull earth and sing
Life tempest swoon to calms on every string
Ah sweet Enchantress if I do but dream
If earthly visions have been only mine
My weakness in thy service woos esteem
And proves my truth as almost worthy thine
And still warm courage calming many a fear
Heartens my hand once more thy harp to try
To join the anthem of the minstrel year
For summer music in thy praise is high
The very winds about thy mantle sigh
Love-melodies thy minstrel bards to be
Insects and birds exerting all their skill
Float in continued song for mastery
While in thy haunts loud leaps the little rill
There still I see thee fold thy mantle grey
To trace the dewy lawn at morn and night
And there I see thee in the sunny day
Withdraw thy veil and shine confest in light
Burning my fancies with a wild delight
To win a portion of thy blushing fame
Though haughty Fancy treat thy power as small
And Fashion thy simplicity disclaim
Should but a portion of thy mantle fall
Not with the mighty to thy shrine I come
In anxious sighs or self applauding mirth
On Mount Parnassus as thine heir to roam
I dare not credit that immortal birth
But mingling with the lesser ones on earth 
Like as the little lark from off its nest
Beside the mossy hill awakes in glee
To seek the morning throne a merry guest 
So do I seek thy shrine if that may be
If without thee 'neath storms and clouds and wind
I've roam'd the wood and field and meadow lea
And found no flowers but what the vulgar find
Nor met one breath of living poesy
Among such charms where inspirations be
The fault is mine and I must bear the lot
Of missing praise to merit thy disdain
To feel each idle plea though urged forgot
I can but sigh though foolish to complain
Then will it prove presumption thus to dare
To add fresh failings to each faulty song
Urging thy blessings on an idle prayer
To sanction silly themes it will be wrong
For one so lowly to be heard so long
Yet sweet Enchantress yet a little while
Forego impatience and from frowns refrain
The strong are ne'er debarr'd thy cheering smile
Why should the weak who need them most complain
But if my efforts on thy harp prove true
Which bashful youth at first so feared to try
If aught of nature be in sounds I drew
From hope young dreams and doubt uncertainty
To these late offerings not without their sigh
Then on thine altar shall these themes be laid
And past the deeds of graven brass remain
Filling a space in time that shall not fade
And if it be not so avert disdain
Up this green woodland-ride let softly rove
And list the nightingale she dwells just here
Hush let the wood-gate softly clap for fear
The noise might drive her from her home of love
For here I've heard her many a merry year 
At morn at eve nay all the live-long day
As though she lived on song This very spot
Just where that old-man's-beard all wildly trails
Rude arbours o'er the road and stops the way 
And where that child its blue-bell flowers hath got
Laughing and creeping through the mossy rails 
There have I hunted like a very boy
Creeping on hands and knees through matted thorn
To find her nest and see her feed her young
And vainly did I many hours employ
All seemed as hidden as a thought unborn
And where those crimping fern-leaves ramp among
The hazel under boughs I've nestled down
And watched her while she sung and her renown
Hath made me marvel that so famed a bird
Should have no better dress than russet brown
Her wings would tremble in her ecstasy
And feathers stand on end as 'twere with joy
And mouth wide open to release her heart
Of its out-sobbing songs The happiest part
Of summer fame she shared for so to me
Did happy fancies shapen her employ
But if I touched a bush or scarcely stirred
All in a moment stopt I watched in vain
The timid bird had left the hazel bush
And at a distance hid to sing again
Lost in a wilderness of listening leaves
Rich Ecstasy would pour its luscious strain
Till envy spurred the emulating thrush
To start less wild and scarce inferior songs
For while of half the year Care him bereaves
To damp the ardour of his speckled breast
The nightingale to summer life belongs
And naked trees and winter nipping wrongs
Are strangers to her music and her rest
Her joys are evergreen her world is wide 
Hark there she is as usual let be hush 
For in this black-thorn clump if rightly guest
Her curious house is hidden Part aside
These hazel branches in a gentle way
And stoop right cautious 'neath the rustling boughs
For we will have another search to-day
And hunt this fern-strewn thorn-clump round and round
And where this reeded wood-grass idly bows
We'll wade right through it is a likely nook
In such like spots and often on the ground
They'll build where rude boys never think to look 
Aye as I live her secret nest is here
Upon this white-thorn stump I've searched about
For hours in vain There put that bramble by 
Nay trample on its branches and get near
How subtle is the bird she started out
And raised a plaintive note of danger nigh
Ere we were past the brambles and now near
Her nest she sudden stops as choking fear
That might betray her home So even now
We'll leave it as we found it safety guard
Of pathless solitude shall keep it still
See there she sitting on the old oak bough
Mute in her fears our presence doth retard
Her joys and doubt turns every rapture chill
Sing on sweet bird may no worse hap befall
Thy visions than the fear that now deceives
We will not plunder music of its dower
Nor turn this spot of happiness to thrall
For melody seems hid in every flower
That blossoms near thy home These harebells all
Seem bowing with the beautiful in song
And gaping cuckoo-flowers with spotted leaves
Seems blushing of the singing it has heard
How curious is the nest no other bird
Uses such loose materials or weaves
Its dwelling in such spots dead open leaves
Are placed without and velvet moss within
And little scraps of grass and scant and spare
What scarcely seem materials down and hair
For from men haunts she nothing seems to win
Yet Nature is the builder and contrives
Homes for her children comfort even here
Where Solitude disciples spend their lives
Unseen save when a wanderer passes near
That loves such pleasant places Deep adown
The nest is made a hermit mossy cell
Snug lie her curious eggs in number five
Of deadened green or rather olive brown
And the old prickly thorn-bush guards them well
So here we'll leave them still unknown to wrong
As the old woodland legacy of song
