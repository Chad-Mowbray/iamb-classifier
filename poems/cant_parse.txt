On this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight
Where Goneril's soul made chill and foul the mist,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
Who hymned the song of Peace o'er Bethlehem's fields!
Now is the time that face should form another;
The sun that smote and kissed the dark to death
The whole world, visible, audible, was he:
From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns,
Of consentaneous love inspires all life:
To myriads, who still grow beneath her care,
Space, matter, time and mind let the sight
Whose roar is wakened into echoings sweet
All is not lost the unconquerable will,
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
