Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,
Lamp lit his face, moon river hit his side
Where we behold, as one who in a glass
But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
disceased to pass address the earth aspect
the expeditious pass address within
disceased to pass address the earth respect
'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none
Go just alike, yet each believes his own.
In Poets as true genius is but rare,
True Taste as seldom is the Critic's share;
Both must alike from Heav'n derive their light,
These born to judge, as well as those to write.
Let such teach others who themselves excel,
And censure freely who have written well.
But are not Critics to their judgment too?
Both must alike from Heaven derive their light,
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,
Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
In the beginning how the heavens and earth
Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill
Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,
This is the time, when most divine to hear,
The voice of Adoration rouses me,
As with a Cherub's trump: and high upborne,
Yea, mingling with the Choir, I seem to view
Yet thou more bright than all the Angel-blaze,
That harbingered thy birth, Thou Man of Woes!
Despised Galilaean! For the Great
Stay, monster, ere thou sink-thus on thy head
Set we our bolder foot; with which we tread
Thy malice into earth: so Spite should die,
Despised and scorn'd by noble industry.
If any muse why I salute the stage,
An armed Prologue; know, 'tis a dangerous age:
Wherein who writes, had need present his scenes
Forty-fold proof against the conjuring means
Of base detractors, and illiterate apes,
That fill up rooms in fair and formal shapes.
'Gainst these, have we put on this forced defence:
Their moods he rather pities than envies:
His mind it is above their injuries.
What could they say to win again my grace
Forsooth, that they had seen my mistress' face. 
Another time, my heart I called to mind,
Thinking that he this woe on me had brought, 
Because that he to love his force resigned, 
When of such wars my fancy never thought : 
What could he say when I would him have slain? 
That he was hers, and had forgone my chain. 
At last, when I perceived both eyes and heart 
Excuse themselves, as guiltless of my ill, 
I found myself the cause of all my smart. 
And told myself that I myself would kill : 
Yet when I saw myself to you was true, 
I loved myself, because myself loved you. 
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit

When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
Proving his beauty by succession thine!
This were to be new made when thou art old,


And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
Who hymned the song of Peace o'er Bethlehem's fields!
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
