Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,
Lamp lit his face, moon river hit his side
Where we behold, as one who in a glass
But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
disceased to pass address the earth aspect
the expeditious pass address within
disceased to pass address the earth respect
'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none
Go just alike, yet each believes his own.
In Poets as true genius is but rare,
True Taste as seldom is the Critic's share;
Both must alike from Heav'n derive their light,
These born to judge, as well as those to write.
Let such teach others who themselves excel,
And censure freely who have written well.
Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,
But are not Critics to their judgment too?
