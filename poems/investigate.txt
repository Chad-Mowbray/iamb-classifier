And with continual watch did warely keepe
Fidessa hight the falsest Dame on ground
Thy life and honour late adventurest 
Of wedlocke to that new unknowen guest
And kist the ground whereon his foot was pight
Wherewith her heavenly beautie she did hide
But that proud Paynim forward came so fierce
Whence mounting up they find purveyance meet
With shaumes and trompets and with Clarions sweet 
Their Lord and Patrone loud did him proclame
Of sage and sober Peres all gravely gownd
And seemeth safe from storms that may offend
