Where it should not be quenched day nor night
And with continual watch did warely keepe
To have bene wroght by that false sorceresse
Fidessa hight the falsest Dame on ground
What woman and wherefere doth me upbrayd
Thy life and honour late adventurest 
Redoubted knight that for mine onely sake
He was affiaunced long time before
Of wedlocke to that new unknowen guest
And kist the ground whereon his foot was pight
Wherewith her heavenly beautie she did hide
But that proud Paynim forward came so fierce
Who then with utt'rance grave and count'nance sad
Their fervent appetites they quenched had
Whence mounting up they find purveyance meet
With shaumes and trompets and with Clarions sweet
