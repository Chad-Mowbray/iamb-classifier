Not marching now in fields of Thrasymene
Where Mars did mate the Carthaginians
Nor sporting in the dalliance of love
In courts of kings where state is overturn'd
Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds
Intends our Muse to vaunt heavenly verse
Only this gentlemen we must perform
The form of Faustus' fortunes good or bad
To patient judgments we appeal our plaud
And speak for Faustus in his infancy
Now is he born his parents base of stock
In Germany within a town call'd Rhodes
Of riper years to Wertenberg he went
Whereas his kinsmen chiefly brought him up
So soon he profits in divinity
The fruitful plot of scholarism grac'd
That shortly he was grac'd with doctor name
Excelling all whose sweet delight disputes
In heavenly matters of theology
Till swoln with cunning of a self-conceit
His waxen wings did mount above his reach
And melting heavens conspir'd his overthrow
For falling to a devilish exercise
And glutted now with learning golden gifts
He surfeits upon cursed necromancy
Nothing so sweet as magic is to him
Which he prefers before his chiefest bliss
And this the man that in his study sits
Settle thy studies Faustus and begin
To sound the depth of that thou wilt profess
Having commenc'd be a divine in shew
Yet level at the end of every art
And live and die in Aristotle works
Sweet Analytics 'tis thou hast ravish'd me
Bene disserere est finis logices
Is to dispute well logic chiefest end
Affords this art no greater miracle
Then read no more thou hast attain'd that end
A greater subject fitteth Faustus' wit
Bid Economy Galen come
Seeing Ubi desinit philosophus ibi incipit medicus
Be a physician Faustus heap up gold
And be eterniz'd for some wondrous cure
Summum bonum medicinae sanitas
The end of physic is our body health
Why Faustus hast thou not attain'd that end
Is not thy common talk found aphorisms
Are not thy bills hung up as monuments
Whereby whole cities have escap'd the plague
And thousand desperate maladies been eas'd
Yet art thou still but Faustus and a man
Or being dead raise them to life again
Then this profession were to be esteem'd
Physic farewell Where is Justinian
Such is the subject of the institute
And universal body of the law
This study fits a mercenary drudge
Who aims at nothing but external trash
Too servile and illiberal for me
When all is done divinity is best
Jerome Bible Faustus view it well
How am I glutted with conceit of this
Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please
Resolve me of all ambiguities
Perform what desperate enterprise I will
I'll have them fly to India for gold
Ransack the ocean for orient pearl
And search all corners of the new-found world
For pleasant fruits and princely delicates
I'll have them read me strange philosophy
And tell the secrets of all foreign kings
I'll have them wall all Germany with brass
And make swift Rhine circle fair Wertenberg
I'll have them fill the public schools with silk
Wherewith the students shall be bravely clad
I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring
And chase the Prince of Parma from our land
And reign sole king of all the provinces
Yea stranger engines for the brunt of war
Than was the fiery keel at Antwerp bridge
I'll make my servile spirits to invent
Come German Valdes and Cornelius
And make me blest with your sage conference
Valdes sweet Valdes and Cornelius
Know that your words have won me at the last
To practice magic and concealed arts
Yet not your words only but mine own fantasy
That will receive no object for my head
But ruminates on necromantic skill
Philosophy is odious and obscure
Both law and physic are for petty wits
Divinity is basest of the three
Unpleasant harsh contemptible and vile
'Tis magic magic that hath ravish'd me
Then gentle friends aid me in this attempt
And I that have with concise syllogisms
Gravell'd the pastors of the German church
And made the flowering pride of Wertenberg
Swarm to my problems as the infernal spirits
On sweet Musaeus when he came to hell
Will be as cunning was
Whose shadow made all Europe honour him
Faustus these books thy wit and our experience
Shall make all nations to canonize us
As Indian Moors obey their Spanish lords
So shall the spirits of every element
Be always serviceable to us three
Like lions shall they guard us when we please
Like Almain rutters with their horsemen staves
Or Lapland giants trotting by our sides
Sometimes like women or unwedded maids
Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows
Than have the white breasts of the queen of love
From Venice shall they drag huge argosies
And from America the golden fleece
That yearly stuffs old Philip treasury
If learned Faustus will be resolute
Valdes as resolute am I in this
As thou to live therefore object it not
The miracles that magic will perform
Will make thee vow to study nothing else
He that is grounded in astrology
Enrich'd with tongues well seen in minerals
Hath all the principles magic doth require
Then doubt not Faustus but to be renowm'd
And more frequented for this mystery
Than heretofore the Delphian oracle
The spirits tell me they can dry the sea
And fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks
Ay all the wealth that our forefathers hid
Within the massy entrails of the earth
Then tell me Faustus what shall we three want
Nothing O this cheers my soul
Come shew me some demonstrations magical
That I may conjure in some lusty grove
And have these joys in full possession
Then haste thee to some solitary grove
And bear wise Bacon and Albertus' works
The Hebrew Psalter and New Testament
And whatsoever else is requisite
We will inform thee ere our conference cease
Valdes first let him know the words of art
And then all other ceremonies learn'd
Faustus may try his cunning by himself
First I'll instruct thee in the rudiments
And then wilt thou be perfecter than I
Then come and dine with me and after meat
We'll canvass every quiddity thereof
For ere I sleep I'll try what I can do
This night I'll conjure though I die therefore
I charge thee to return and change thy shape
Thou art too ugly to attend on me
Go and return an old Franciscan friar
That holy shape becomes a devil best
I see there virtue in my heavenly words
Who would not be proficient in this art
How pliant is this Mephistophilis
Full of obedience and humility
Such is the force of magic and my spells
No Faustus thou art conjuror laureat
That canst command great Mephistophilis
Quin regis Mephistophilis fratris imagine
Now Faustus what wouldst thou have me do
I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live
To do whatever Faustus shall command
Be it to make the moon drop from her sphere
Or the ocean to overwhelm the world
I am a servant to great Lucifer
And may not follow thee without his leave
No more than he commands must we perform
Did not he charge thee to appear to me
No I came hither of mine own accord
Did not my conjuring speeches raise thee speak
That was the cause but yet per accidens
For when we hear one rack the name of God
Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ
We fly in hope to get his glorious soul
Nor will we come unless he use such means
Whereby he is in danger to be damn'd
Therefore the shortest cut for conjuring
Is stoutly to abjure the Trinity
And pray devoutly to the prince of hell
Already done and holds this principle
There is no chief but only Belzebub
To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself
This word damnation terrifies not him
For he confounds hell in Elysium
His ghost be with the old philosophers
But leaving these vain trifles of men souls
Tell me what is that Lucifer thy lord
Arch-regent and commander of all spirits
Was not that Lucifer an angel once
Yes Faustus and most dearly lov'd of God
How comes it then that he is prince of devils
O by aspiring pride and insolence
For which God threw him from the face of heaven
And what are you that live with Lucifer
Unhappy spirits that fell with Lucifer
Conspir'd against our God with Lucifer
And are for ever damn'd with Lucifer
How comes it then that thou art out of hell
Why this is hell nor am I out of it
Think'st thou that I who saw the face of God
And tasted the eternal joys of heaven
Am not tormented with ten thousand hells
In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss
O Faustus leave these frivolous demands
Which strike a terror to my fainting soul
What is great Mephistophilis so passionate
For being deprived of the joys of heaven
Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude
And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess
Go bear these tidings to great Lucifer
Seeing Faustus hath incurr'd eternal death
By desperate thoughts against Jove deity
Say he surrenders up to him his soul
So he will spare him four and twenty years
Letting him live in all voluptuousness
Having thee ever to attend on me
To give me whatsoever I shall ask
To tell me whatsoever I demand
To slay mine enemies and aid my friends
And always be obedient to my will
Go and return to mighty Lucifer
And meet me in my study at midnight
And then resolve me of thy master mind
Had I as many souls as there be stars
I'd give them all for Mephistophilis
By him I'll be great emperor of the world
And make a bridge thorough the moving air
To pass the ocean with a band of men
I'll join the hills that bind the Afric shore
And make that country continent to Spain
And both contributory to my crown
The Emperor shall not live but by my leave
Nor any potentate of Germany
Now that I have obtain'd what I desir'd
I'll live in speculation of this art
Till Mephistophilis return again
Thou needs be damn'd and canst thou not be sav'd
What boots it then to think of God or heaven
Away with such vain fancies and despair
Despair in God and trust in Belzebub
Now go not backward no Faustus be resolute
Why waver'st thou O something soundeth in mine ears
Abjure this magic turn to God again
Ay and Faustus will turn to God again
To God he loves thee not
The god thou serv'st is thine own appetite
Wherein is fix'd the love of Belzebub
To him I'll build an altar and a church
And offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes
As great as have the human souls of men
But tell me Faustus shall I have thy soul
And I will be thy slave and wait on thee
And give thee more than thou hast wit to ask
Ay Mephistophilis I give it thee
Then Faustus stab thine arm courageously
And bind thy soul that at some certain day
Great Lucifer may claim it as his own
And then be thou as great as Lucifer
Lo Mephistophilis for love of thee
I cut mine arm and with my proper blood
Assure my soul to be great Lucifer's
Chief lord and regent of perpetual night
View here the blood that trickles from mine arm
And let it be propitious for my wish
Write it in manner of a deed of gift
Ay so I will But Mephistophilis
My blood congeals and I can write no more
I'll fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight
What might the staying of my blood portend
Is it unwilling I should write this bill
Why streams it not that I may write afresh
FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL ah there it stay'd
Why shouldst thou not is not thy soul shine own
Then write again FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL
Having now my good Mephistophilis
Pass'd with delight the stately town of Trier
Environ'd round with airy mountain-tops
With walls of flint and deep-entrenched lakes
Not to be won by any conquering prince
From Paris next coasting the realm of France
We saw the river Maine fall into Rhine
Whose banks are set with groves of fruitful vines
Then up to Naples rich Campania
Whose buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye
The streets straight forth and pav'd with finest brick
Quarter the town in four equivalents
There saw we learned Maro golden tomb
The way he cut an English mile in length
Thorough a rock of stone in one night space
From thence to Venice Padua and the rest
In one of which a sumptuous temple stands
That threats the stars with her aspiring top
Thus hitherto hath Faustus spent his time
But tell me now what resting-place is this
Hast thou as erst I did command
Conducted me within the walls of Rome
Tut 'tis no matter man we'll be bold with his good cheer
And now my Faustus that thou mayst perceive
What Rome containeth to delight thee with
Know that this city stands upon seven hills
That underprop the groundwork of the same
Just through the midst runs flowing Tiber stream
With winding banks that cut it in two parts
Over the which four stately bridges lean
That make safe passage to each part of Rome
Upon the bridge call'd Ponte Angelo
Erected is a castle passing strong
Within whose walls such store of ordnance are
And double cannons fram'd of carved brass
As match the days within one complete year
Besides the gates and high pyramides
Which Julius Caesar brought from Africa
When Faustus had with pleasure ta'en the view
Of rarest things and royal courts of kings
He stay'd his course and so returned home
Where such as bear his absence but with grief
I mean his friends and near'st companions
Did gratulate his safety with kind words
And in their conference of what befell
Touching his journey through the world and air
They put forth questions of astrology
Which Faustus answer'd with such learned skill
As they admir'd and wonder'd at his wit
Now is his fame spread forth in every land
Amongst the rest the Emperor is one
Carolus the Fifth at whose palace now
Faustus is feasted 'mongst his noblemen
What there he did in trial of his art
I leave untold your eyes shall see perform'd
Then Doctor Faustus mark what I shall say
As I was sometime solitary set
Within my closet sundry thoughts arose
About the honour of mine ancestors
How they had won by prowess such exploits
Got such riches subdu'd so many kingdoms
As we that do succeed or they that shall
Hereafter possess our throne shall
I fear me ne'er attain to that degree
Of high renown and great authority
Amongst which kings is Alexander the Great
Chief spectacle of the world pre-eminence
The bright shining of whose glorious acts
Lightens the world with his reflecting beams
As when I hear but motion made of him
It grieves my soul I never saw the man
If therefore thou by cunning of thine art
Canst raise this man from hollow vaults below
Where lies entomb'd this famous conqueror
And bring with him his beauteous paramour
Both in their right shapes gesture and attire
They us'd to wear during their time of life
Thou shalt both satisfy my just desire
And give me cause to praise thee whilst I live
Not at first sight nor with a dribbing shot
Love gave the wound which while I breath will bleede
But knowne worth did in mine of time proceede
Till by degrees it had full conquest got
I sawe and lik'd I lik'd but loved not
I lov'd but did not straight what Love decreede
At length to Loves decrees I forst agreede
Yet with repining at so partiall lot
Now even that foot-steppe of lost libertie
Is gone and now like slave borne Muscovite
I call it praise to suffer tyrannie
And now imploy the remnant of my wit
To make my selfe believe that all is well
While with a feeling skill I paint my hell
Let Daintie wittes cry on the Sisters nine
That bravely maskt their fancies may be tolde
Or Pinders Apes flaunt they in phrases fine
Enamling with pyde flowers their thoughts of gold
Or els let them in statelyee glorie shine
Ennobling new found tropes with problemes old
Or with strange similes inricht each line
Of hearbes or beasts which Inde or Affricke hold
For me in sooth no Muse but one I know
Phrases and Problemes from my reach do growe
And straunge things cost too deere for my poor sprites
How then even thus in Stellas face I reede
What love and beautie be then all my deede
But coppying is what in her nature writes
Vertue alas now let me take some rest
Thou set'st a bate betweene my will and wit
If vaine love have my simple soule opprest
Leave what thou lik'st not deale not thou with it
Thy Scepter use in some olde Catoes brest
Churches or Schooles are for thy seat more fit
I doe confes pardon a fault confest
My mouth too tender is for thy hard bit
But if that needes thou wilt usurping bee
The little reason that is left in mee
And still th' effect of thy perswasions proove
I sweare my heart such one shall shew to thee
That shrines in flesh so true a deitie
That Vertue thou thy selfe shalt be in love
It is most true that eyes are found to serve
The inward light and that the heavenly part
Ought to be King from whose rules who doth swerve
Rebels to nature strive for their owne smart
It is most true what wee call Cupids dart
An Image is which for ourselves we carve
And fooles adore in Temple of our hart
Till that good God make church and Church-men starve
True that true beautie vertue is in deede
Whereof this beautie can but be a shade
Which Elements with mortall mixture breede
True that on earth we are but Pilgrimes made
And should in soule up to our Country move
True and most true that I must Stella love
When nature made her chiefe worke Stella eyes
In collour blacke why wrapt she beames so bright
Would she in beamy blacke like Painter wise
Frame daintiest lustre mixte of shades of light
Or did she els that sober hewe devise
In object best to strength and knitt our sighte
Least if no vaile these brave gleames did disguise
They Sun-like should more dazell than delight
Or would she her miraculous power shewe
That whereas blacke seemes Beauties contrarie
Shee even in blacke doth make all Beauties flower
Both so and thus she minding Love should bee
Plaste ever there gave him this mourning weede
To honour all their deathes which for her bleede
In truth oh Love with what a boyish kinde
Thou doost proceede in thy most serious waies
That when the heaven to thee his best displaies
Yet of that best thou leav'st the best behinde
That like a Childe that some faire booke doth finde
With gilden leaves of colloured Velom playes
Or at the most on some faire picture stares
But never heedes the fruite of Writers minde
So when thou sawest in Natures cabinet
Stella thou straight lokest babies in her eyes
In her chekes pit thou didst thy pitfall set
And in her brest bo-peepe or touching lyes
Playing and shining in each outward part
But foole seekst not to get into her hart
Cupid because thou shin'st in Stellas eyes
That from her lookes thy day-nets now scapes free
That those lips swelde so full of thee they be
That her sweet breath makes all thy flames t'arise
That in her brest thy pap well sugred lyes
That her grace gracious makes thy wrongs that shee
What word so ere shee speakes perswades for thee
That her cleere voice lifts thy fame to the skyes
Thou countest Stella thine like those whose powres
Having got up a breach by fighting well
Cry victorie this faire day all is ours
Oh no her heart is such a Cytadell
So fortified with wit stor'd with disdaine
That to winne it is all the skill and paine
Phoebus was Judge betweene Jove Mars love
Of those three Gods whose armes the fairest were
Joves golden shield did Eagle Sables beare
Whose talents held young Ganimede above
But in verde fielde Mars bare a golden Speare
Which through a bleeding heart his point did shove
Each had his Crest Mars carried Venus glove
Jove on his Helme the Thunderbolt did reare
Cupid then smiles for on his crest there lyes
Stellas faire haire her face he makes his shielde
Where Roses gueules are borne in silver fielde
Phoebus drewe wide the Curtaine of the skyes
To blase the last and swore devoutly then
The first thus macht were scarcely Gentlemen
Alas have I not paine enough my friend
Uppon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tyre
Than did on him who first stole downe the fyre
While Love on me doth all his quiver spend
But with your rubarbe wordes you must contend
To greeve me worse in saying that desier
Doth plunge my well form'd soule even in the mier
Of sinfull thoughtes which doe in ruine ende
If that be sinne which doth the manners frame
Well stayed with trueth in worde and faith of deede
Readie of wit and fearing nought but shame
If it be sin which in fixt hart dooth breede
A loathing of all lose unchastitie
Then love is sin and let me sinfull bee
You that do search for every purling spring
Which from the rybs of old Parnassus flowes
And every flower not sweete perhaps which growes
Neere there about into your Poesie wring
Ye that do Dictionaries method bring
Into your rymes running in ratling rowes
You that poore Petrarchs long deceased woes
With new borne sighes devised wit do sing
You take wrong wayes those far-set helps be such
As doe bewray a want of inward tutch
And sure at length stolne goods doe come to light
But if both for your love and skill you name
You seeke to nurse at fullest brest of Fame
Stella behold and then begin t'endite
In nature apt to like when I did see
Beauties which were of many Carrects fine
My boyling spirits did thether soone encline
And Love I thought that I was full of thee
But finding not those restles flames in mee
Which others said did make their soules to pyne
I thought those babes of some pins hurt did whine
By my love judging what loves paines might be
But while I thus with this young Lyon plaid
Myne eyes shall I say curst or blest beheld
Stella now shee is nam'de neede more be sayd
In her sight I a lesson new have speld
I now have learnd love right and learnd even so
As who by being poysond doth poyson know
His mother deere Cupid offended late
Because that Mars grew slacker in her love
With pricking shot he did not throughly move
To keepe the pace of their first loving state
The boy refusde for feare of Marses hate
Who threatned stripes if he his wrath did prove
But she in chafe him from her lap did shove
Brake bowe brake shafts where Cupid weeping sate
Till that his Grandam Nature pittying it
Of Stellas browes made him two better bowes
And in her eyes of arrowes infinit
O how for joye he leapes o how he crowes
And straight therewith like wagges new got to play
Falls to shrewde turnes and I was in his way
With what strange checkes I in my selfe am shent
When into Reasons Audit I doe goe
And by just counts my selfe a Bankerowt know
Of all those goods which heaven to me hath lent
Unable quite to pay even Natures rent
Which unto it by birth-right I doe owe
And which is worse no good excuse can showe
But that my wealth I have most idely spent
My youth doth waste my knowledge brings forth toyes
My wit doth strive those passions to defende
Which for reward spoyle it with vaine annoyes
I see my course to lose my selfe doth bende
I see and yet no greater sorrowe take
Than that I looke no more for Stellas sake
On Cupids bowe how are my hart strings bent
That see my wracke and yet imbrace the same
When most I glorie then I feele most shame
I willing run yet while I runne repent
My best wittes still their owne disgrace invent
My verie ynke turnes straight to Stella name
And yet my words as them my penne doth frame
Against themselves that they are vainely spent
For though she passe all things yet what is all
That unto me who fare like him that both
Lookes to the skyes and in a ditch doth fall
O let me prop my mind yet in his grouth
And not in nature for best fruits unfit
Scholler saith Love bend hitherward your wit
Fly flye my friends I have my deathes wound flye
See there that boy that murthering boy I say
Who like a thiefe hid in a bush doth lye
Tyll blooddy bullet get him wrongfull pray
So tyrant he no fitter place could spy
Nor so farre levell in so secrete stay
As that sweete blacke which veiles thy heavenly eye
There himselfe with his shot he close doth laye
Poore passenger passe now thereby I did
And staid pleasd with prospect of the place
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid
But straight I saw motions of lightnings grace
And there descried the glisterings of his dart
But ere I could flie thence it pearst my hart
Your words my freend right helthfull caustickes blame
My young minde marde whom Love doth windlase so
That my owne writings like bad servants showe
My wits quick in vaine thoughts in vertue lame
That Plato I reade for nought but if he tame
Such coltish giers that to my birth I owe
Nobler desires lest els that friendly foe
Great expectation were a traine of shame
For since mad March great promise made to mee
If now the May of my yeeres much decline
What can be hop'd my harvest time will be
Sure you say well your wisedomes golden myne
Digs deepe with learnings spade now tell me this
Hath this world ought so faire as Stella is
In highest way of heaven the Sunne did ride
Progressing then from fayre Twynns golden place
Having no maske of Clowdes before his face
But shining forth of heat in his chiefe pride
When some faire Ladies by hard promise tyde
On horsebacke met him in his furious race
Yet each prepar'de with Fannes well shading grace
From that foes wounds their tender skinnes to hide
Stella alone with face unarmed marcht
Either to doe like him which open shone
Or carelesse of the welth because her owne
Yet were the hid and meaner beauties parcht
Her dainties bare went free the cause was this
The Sunne which others burnt did her but kisse
The curious wits seeing dull pensivenes
Bewray it selfe in my long setled eyes
Whence those same fumes of mellancholie rise
With idle paines and missing ayme do gesse
Some that know how my spring I did adresse
Deem'd that my Muse some fruite of knowledge plyes
Others because the Prince my service tryes
Thinke that I thinke State errors to redresse
But harder Judges judge ambitious rage
Scourge of it selfe still clyming slippery place
Holds my young braine captiv'd in golden cage
O fooles or over-wise alas the case
Of all my thoughts have neither stop nor start
But onely Stellas eyes and Stellas hart
Rich fooles there there be whose base and filthie hart
Lyes hatching still the goods wherein they flow
And damning their owne selves to Tantal smart
Welth breeding want more rich more wretched grow
Yet to those fooles heaven doth such wit impart
As what their hands doe hold their heads doe know
And knowing love and loving lay apart
As scattered things farre from all dangers show
But that rich foole who by blind Fortunes lot
The richest gem of love and life enjoyes
And can with foule abuse such beauties blot
Let him deprived of sweet but unfelt joyes
Exilde for aye from those high treasures which
He knowes not grow in onely follie rich
The wisest scholler of the wight most wise
By Phoebus doome with sugred sentence sayes
That vertue if it once meete with our eyes
Strange flames of love it in our soules would rayse
But for that man with paine this truth discries
While he each thing in sences ballance wayes
And so nor will nor can behold those skyes
Which inward Summe to heroicke mindes displaies
Vertue of late with vertuous care to stir
Love of himselfe takes Stellas shape that hee
To mortall eyes might sweetly shine in her
It is most true for since I her did see
Vertues great beautie in her face I prove
And finde th' effect for I doe burne in love
Though duskie wits dare scorne Astrologie
And fooles can thinke those lampes of purest light
Whose number waies greatnes eternitie
Promising wondrous wonders to invite
To have for no cause birth-right in the skyes
But for to spangle the blacke weedes of Night
Or for some Braule which in that Chamber hie
They should still daunce to please a gazers sight
For mee I doe Nature unydle know
And know great causes great effects procure
And know those bodies high raigne on the low
And if these rules did fayle proofe makes me sure
Who oft foresee my after following case
By onely those two starres in Stella face
Because I oft in darke abstracted guise
Seeme most alone in greatest company
With dearth of words and aunswers quite awry
To them that would make speech of speech arise
They deeme and of their doome the rumor flies
That poyson foule of bubling pride doth lie
So in my swelling brest that onely I
Faune on my selfe all others doe dispise
Yet pride I thinke doth not my soule possesse
Which lookes too oft in this unflattering glasse
But one worse fault ambition I confesse
That makes me oft my best freends over-passe
Unseene unheard while thought to highest place
Bends all his powers even unto Stellas grace
You that with allegories curious frame
Of others children changelings use to make
With mee those paines for good now doe not take
I list not dig so deepe for brasen fame
When I see Stella I doe meane the same
Princesse of beautie for whose onely sake
The raynes of love I love though never slake
And joy therein though Nations count it shame
I begge no subject to use eloquence
Nor in hid waies to guide Philosophie
Looke at my hands for no such quintessence
But know that I in pure simplicitie
Breath out the flames which burn within my hart
Love only leading me into this arte
Like some weake Lords Neighbord by mightie kings
To keepe themselves and their chiefe Cities free
Doe easily yeelde that all their coast may be
Readie to serve their Campe of needfull things
So Stellas hart finding what power Love brings
To keepe it selfe in life and libertie
Doth willing graunt that in the Frontire he
Use all to help his other conquerings
And thus her hart escapes but thus her eyes
Serve him with shot her lips his Heralds are
Her brests his Tents legges his tryumphall Chare
Herselfe his foode her skin his Armour brave
And I but for because my prospect lyes
Upon that coast am given up for slave
Whether the Turkish new Moone minded be
To fill her hornes this yeere on Christian coast
How Polands King mindes without leave of hoast
To warme with ill made fire cold Muscovie
If French can yet three parts in one agree
What now the Dutch in their full diets boast
How Holland harts now so good Townes are lost
Trust in the shade of pleasing Orange tree
How Ulster likes of the same goldenbitt
Wherewith my Father made it once halfe tame
If in the Scottish Court be weltering yet
These questions busie wits to me do frame
I combered with good manners aunswere doe
But know not how for still I thinke on you
With how sad steps o Moone thou clim'st the skyes
How silently and with how meane a face
What may it be that even in heavenly place
That busie Archer his sharpe Arrowes tryes
Sure if that long with love acquainted eyes
Can judge of love thou feelst of Lovers case
I reade within thy lookes thy languisht grace
To mee that feele the like my state discries
Then even of fellowship o Moone tell me
Is constant love deemde there but want of wit
Are beauties there as proude as here there be
Doe they above love to be lov'd and yet
Those Lovers scorne whom that love doth possesse
Doe they call vertue there ungratefulnesse
Morpheus the lively sonne of deadlie Sleepe
Witnes of life to them that living die
A Prophet oft and oft an Historie
A Poet eake as humors flye and creepe
Since thou in me so sure a power doost keepe
That never I with clos'd up fence doe lye
But by thy worke my Stella I discry
Teaching blind eyes both how to smile and weepe
Vouchsafe of all acquaintance this to tell
Whence hast thou Ivorie Rubies Pearle and Golde
To shew her skin lips teeth and head so well
Foole aunswers he no Indes such treasures hold
But from thy hart while my Sire charmeth thee
Sweet Stellas Image I do steale to mee
I might unhappy word woe me I might
And then would not nor could not see my blisse
Till now wrapt in a most infernall Night
I finde how heavenly day wretch did I misse
Hart rent thy selfe thou doost thy selfe but right
No lovely Paris made thy Helen his
No force no fraude robd thee of thy delight
Nor fortune of thy fortune Author is
But to my selfe my selfe did give the blow
While too much wit forsooth so trubled me
That I respects for both our sakes must show
And yet could not by rysing morne fore-see
How faire a day was neere o punisht eyes
That I had beene more foolish or more wise
Come let me write and to what end to ease
A burthened hart how can words ease which are
The glasses of thy daily vexing care
Oft cruell fights well pictured forth doe please
Art not asham'd to publish thy disease
Nay that may breede my fame it is so rare
But will not wise men thinke thy words fonde ware
Then be they close and they shall none displease
What idler thing than speake and not be heard
What harder thing than smart and not to speake
Peace foolish wit with wit my wit is marde
Thus write I while I doubt to write and wreake
My harmes in ynkes poore losse perhaps some finde
Stellas great power that so confus'd my minde
What may words say or what may words not say
Where truth it selfe must speake like flattery
Within what bounds can one his lyking stay
Where Nature doth with infinite agree
What Nestors counsell can my flames allay
Since Reasons selfe doth blow the coles to me
And ah what hope that hope should once see day
Where Cupid is sworne page to Chastitie
Honour is honoured that thou dost possesse
Him as thy slave and now long needie Fame
Doth even grow rich meaning my Stellas name
Wit learnes in thee perfection to expresse
Not thou by praise but praise in thee is raised
It is a praise to praise where thou art praised
Stella whence doth these newe assaults arise
A conquerd yeelding ransackt hart to win
Whereto long since through my long battred eyes
Whole Armies of thy beauties entred in
And there long since Love thy Lieuetenant lyes
My forces raz'd thy banners rais'd within
Of conquest what do these effects suffise
But wilt new warre uppon thine owne begin
With so sweet voyce and by sweet nature so
In sweetest strength so sweetly skild withall
In all sweet stratagems sweet Art can shew
That not my soule which at thy foot did fall
Long since forst by thy beames but stone nor tree
By sences priviledge can scape from thee
This night while sleepe begins with heavie wings
To close mine eyes and the unbitted thought
Doth fall to stray and my chiefe powers are brought
To leave the scepter of all subject things
The first that straight my fancies errour brings
Unto my minde is Stellas Image wrought
By Loves owne selfe but with so curious draught
That she me thinkes not onely shines but sings
I start looke harke but what inclos'd up sence
Was helde in open sence it flyes away
Leaving me nought but wayling eloquence
I seeing Better sights in sighes decay
Conclude a new and woed Sleepe againe
But him her hoast that unkind guest had slaine
Come Sleepe o Sleepe the certaine knot of peace
The bathing place of wits the balme of woe
The poore mans wealth the prysoners release
The indifferent judge betweene the high and lowe
With shield of proofe shield me from out the presse
Of these fierce darts Dispaire at me doth throw
O make in me those civill warres to cease
I will good trybute pay if thou do so
Take thou of me smooth pillowes sweetest bed
A chamber deafe of noyse and blinde of light
A rosie garland and a wearie head
And if these things as being thine in right
Move not thy heavie grace thou shalt in mee
Livelier than els where Stellas Image see
As good to write as for to lie and groane
O Stella deere how much thy power hath wrought
That hast my minde now of the basest brought
My still kept course while others sleepe to moane
Alas if from the height of Vertues throane
Thou canst vouchsafe the influence of a thought
Upon a wretch which long thy grace hath sought
Way then how I by thee am overthrowne
And then thinke thus although thy beautie be
Made manifest by such a victorie
Yet noblest Conquerers doe wreake avoide
Since then thou hast so farre subdued me
That in my hart I offer still to thee
O doe not let thy Temple be destroide
Having this days my horse my hand my Launce
Guided so well that I obtaind the prize
Both by the judgment of the English eyes
And of some sent from that sweet enmie Fraunce
Horsmen my skill in horsmanship advaunce
Towne folke my strength a daintier Judge applies
His praise to flight which from good use doth rise
Some luckie wits impute it but to chaunce
Others because from both sides I doe take
My blood from them that doe excell in this
Thinke Nature me a man at Armes did make
How farre they shoot awry the true cause is
Stella lookt on and from her heavenly face
Sent forth the beames which made so faire a race
O Eyes which doe the Spheres of beautie move
Whose beames all joyes whose joyes all vertues be
Who while they make Love conquer conquer Love
The Schooles where Venus hath learnd Chastitie
O eyes where humble lookes most glorious prove
Onely loved tyrants just in crueltie
Doe not doe not from poore me once remove
Keepe still my Zenith ever shine on me
For though I never see them but straight waies
My life forgets to nourish languisht sprights
Yet still on me o eyes dart downe your rayes
And if from Majestie of sacred Lights
Oppressing mortall sence my death proceede
Wreckes tryumphs best which Love hie set doth breed
Faire eyes sweet lips deere hart that foolish I
Could hope by Cupids helpe on you to pray
Since to himselfe he doth your gifts apply
As his maine force chiefe sport and easefull stay
For when he will see who dare him gainsay
Then with those eyes he lookes loe by and by
Each soule doth at Loves feete his weapons lay
Glad if for her he give them leave to die
When he will play then in her lips he is
Where blushing red that Loves selfe them do love
With either lip he doth the other kisse
But when he will for quiets sake remove
From all the world her hart is then his roome
Where well he knowes no man to him can come
My words I know doe well set forth my minde
My minde bemones his sence of inward smart
Such smart may pittie claime of any hart
Her hart sweete hart is of no Tygers kinde
And yet she heares and I no pittie finde
But more I cry lesse grace she doth impart
Alas what cause is there so overthwart
That Noblenes it selfe makes thus unkinde
I much doe gesse yet finde no truth save this
That when the breath of my complaint doe touch
Those daintie doores unto the Court of Blisse
The heavenly nature of that place is such
That once come there the sobs of my annoyes
Are metamorphos'd straight to tunes of joyes
Stella oft sees the verie face of woes
Painted in my beclowded stormie face
But cannot skill to pittie my disgrace
No though thereof the cause her selfe shee knowes
Yet hearing late a fable which did show
Of Lovers never knowne a grievous case
Pittie thereof got in her breast such place
As from her eyes a Spring of teares did flow
Alas if Fancie drawne by ymag'd things
Though false yet with free scope more grace doth breede
Then Servants wreck where new doubts honor brings
Than thinke my Deere that in me you doe reede
Of Lovers ruine some thrise sad Tragaedie
I am not I pittie the tale of me
I curst thee oft I pittie now thy case
Blind hitting Boy since shee that thee and me
Rules with a becke so tyranniseth thee
That thou must want or foode or dwelling place
For Shee protests to banish thee her face
Her face o Love a roge thou then should'st bee
If Love learne not alone to love and see
Without desire to feede on further grace
Alas poore wagge that now a Scholler art
To such a Schoole-mistris whose lessons new
Thou needes must misse and so thou needes must smart
Yet deere let me this pardon get of you
So long though he from booke mich to desire
Till without Fuell thou can make hote fire
What have I thus betraide my libertie
Can those black beames such burning marks engrave
In my free side or am I borne a slave
Whose necke becomes such yoke of tyrannie
Or want I sence to feele my miserie
Or spirit disdaine of such disdaine to have
Who for long faith the daily helpe I crave
May get no almes but scorne of beggerie
Vertue awake beautie but beautie is
I may I must I can I will I doe
Leave following that which it is gaine to misse
Let her goe soft but there she comes goe to
Unkind I love you not O mee that eye
Doth make my hart give to my tongue a lye
Soules joy bend not those morning starres from me
Where vertue is made strong by beauties might
Where love is chastnes paine doth learne delight
And humblenes growes on with majestie
What ever may ensue O let me be
Copartner of the ritches of that sight
Let not mine eyes be driven from that light
o looke o shine o let me die and see
For though I oft my selfe of them bemone
That through my hart their beamie darts be gone
Whose curelesse wounds even nowe most freshly bleede
Yet since my deaths wound is already got
Deere killer spare not thy sweete cruell shot
A kinde of grace it is to slaye with speede
I on my horse and Love on me doth trie
Our horsmanship while by strange worke I prove
A horsman to my horse a horse to Love
And now mans wrongs in me poore beast discry
The raines wherewith my ryder doth me tie
Are reverent thoughts which bit of reverence move
Curbde in with feare but with gilt bosse above
Of hope which makes it seeme faire to the eye
The wande is will thou fancie saddle art
Girt fast by memorie and while I spurre
My horse he spurres with sharpe desires my hart
He sits me fast how ever I doe sturre
And now hath made me to his hand so right
That in the manage my selfe do take delight
Stella the fulnes of my thoughts of thee
Cannot be stayed within my panting brest
But they do swell and struggle forth of me
Till that in words thy figure be exprest
And yet as soone as they so formed be
According to my Lord Loves owne behest
With sad eyes I their weake proportion see
To portract what within this world is best
So that I cannot chuse but write my minde
And cannot chuse but put out what I write
While those poore babes their death in birth doe find
And now my penne these lynes had dashed quite
But that they stop his furie from the same
Because their fore-front beares sweet Stellas name
Pardon mine eares both I and they doe pray
So may your tongue full flauntingly proceede
To them that doe such entertainments neede
So may you still have somewhat new to say
On sillie me doe not you burthen lay
Of all the grave conceipts your braine doth breede
But find some Hercules to beard in steede
Of Atlas tyrde your wisedomes heavenly sway
For me while you discourse of courtly tydes
Of cunningst Fishers in most troubled streames
Of straying waves when valiant errour guides
Meane while my hart confers with Stellas beames
And is even woe that so sweet Comedie
By such unfuted speech should hindered be
A Strife is growne betweene Vertue and Love
While each pretends that Stella must be his
Her eyes her lips her all saith Love doe this
Since they doe weare his badge most firmely prove
But Vertue thus that title doth disprove
That Stella o deere name that Stella is
That vertuous Soule sure heyre of heavenly Blisse
Not this faire outside which our hart doth move
And therefore though her beauty and her grace
Be Loves indeede in Stellas selfe he may
By no pretence claime any manner place
Well Love since this Demurre our sute doth staie
Let Vertue have that Stellas selfe yet thus
That Vertue but that body graunt to us
In Martiall sportes I had my cunning tryde
And yet to breake more Staves I did mee adresse
While that the peopl showtes I must confesse
Youth luck and praise even filld my vaines with pride
When Cupid having me his slave descride
In Mars his liverie prauncing in the presse
What now sir foole said he I would no lesse
Looke heere I say I lookt and Stella spide
Who hard by through a window sent forth light
My hart then quake then daz'led were my eyes
One hand forgot to rule th' other to fight
No Trumpet sound I heard nor freendly cries
My foe came on and beate the ayre for mee
Till that her blush taught me my shame to see
Because I breathe not love to every one
Nor doe not use sette Colours for to weare
Nor nourish speciall locks with vowed haire
Nor give each speech a full point of a grone
The Courtly Nymphes acquainted with the mone
Of them which in their lips Loves Standard beare
What he say they of me now I dare sweare
He cannot love no no let him alone
And thinke so still so Stella know my minde
Professe in deede I do not Cupid art
But you faire Maides at length this true shall find
That his right badge is but worne in the hart
Dumbe Swans not chattering Pyes doe Lovers prove
They love in deed who quake to say they love
Fie schoole of Patience fie your Lesson is
Far far too long to learne it without booke
What a whole weeke without one peece of looke
And thinke I should not your large precepts misse
When I might reade those Letters faire of blisse
Which in her face teach vertue I could brooke
Somewhat thy leaden counsels which I tooke
As of a freend that meant not much amisse
But now alas that I doe want her sight
What doost thou thinke that I can ever take
In thy colde stuffe a phlegmatick delight
No Patience if thou wilt my good then make
Her come and heare with patience my desires
And then with patience bid me beare my fire
Muses I oft invoked your whole ayde
With choisest flowres my speech t'engarland so
That it disguisde in true but naked show
Might winne some grace in your sweet skill arraide
And oft whole troupes of saddest words I stayde
Striving abroade a forraging to goe
Untill by your inspiring I might know
How their blacke banners might be best displaid
But now I meane no more your helpe to trye
Nor other sugering of speech to prove
But on her name uncessantly to cry
For let me but name her whom I doe love
So sweete sounde straight my eares and hart doe hit
That I well finde no eloquence like it
Woe having made with many sighs his owne
Each sense of mine each gift each power of minde
Growne now his slaves he forst them out to finde
The throwest words fit for woes selfe to grone
Hoping that when they might finde Stella alone
Before she could prepare to be unkind
Her soule armed with such a daintie rinde
Should soone be hurt with sharpnes of the mone
She heard my plaints and did not onely heare
But them so sweet is she most sweetly sing
With that faire brest making Woes darknes cleere
A prittie case I hoped her to bring
To feele my griefe and she with face and voice
So sweetes my paines that my paines me rejoyce
Doubt there hath beene when with his golden chaine
The Orator so farre mens harts doth bind
That no pace els their guided steps can find
But as in them more shorte or slacke doth raine
Whether with words this sou'raigntte be gaine
Clothde with fine tropes with strongest reason lin'd
Or els pronouncing grace wherewith his minde
Prints his owne lively forme in rudest braine
Now judge by this in pearcing phrases late
Th' Anatomie of all my woes I wrate
Stellas sweete breath the same to me did reede
Oh voyce oh face mauger my speeches might
With wooed woe most ravishing delight
Even in sad mee a joy to me did breede
Deere why make you more of a dogge than me
If he doe love alas I burne in love
If he waite well I never thence would move
If he be faire yet but a dogge can be
Little he is so little worth is he
He barkes my songs thyne owne voyce oft doth prove
Bidden perhaps he fetcheth thee a glove
But I unbid fetch even my soule to thee
Yet while I languish him that bosome clips
That lap doth lap nay lets in spight of spight
This sour-breath'  mate tast of those sugred lips
Alas if you graunt onely such delight
To witles things then Love I hope since wit
Becomes a clogge will soone ease me of it
When my good Angell guides me to the place
where al my good I do in Stella see
That Heaven of joyes throwes only downe on me
Thundred disdaines and Lightning of disgrace
But when the ruggedst step of fortunes race
Makes me fall from her sight then sweetly she
With words whereing the Muses Treasures be
Shewes love and pittie to my absent case
Now I witt-beaten long by hardest fate
So dull am that I cannot looke into
The ground of this fierce love and loving hate
Then some good body tell me how to do
Whose presence absence absence presence is
Blest in my curse and curssed in my blisse
Oft with true sighes oft with uncalled teares
Now with slow words now with dumbe eloquence
I Stellas eyes assailde invade her eares
But this at last is her sweete breath'  defence
That who indeede a sound affection beares
So captives to his Saint both soule and sence
That wholie Hers all selfnes he forbeares
Thence his desire he learnes his lives course thence
Now since this chast love hates this love in mee
With chastned minde I needes must shew that shee
Shall quickly me from what she hates remove
O Doctor Cupid thou for me reply
Driven els to graunt by Angell Sophistry
That I love not without I leave to love
Late tyr'd with woe even ready for to pine
With rage of love I call my Love unkinde
Shee in whose eyes love though unfelt doth shine
Sweetely saide I true love in her should finde
I joyed but straight thus watred was my wine
That love she did but with a love not blinde
Which would not let me whome she lov'd decline
From Nobler course fit for my birth and minde
And therefore her loves Authoritie
Wild me those Tempests of vaine love to flee
And Anchor fast my selfe on vertues shore
Alas if this the onely mettall be
Of love newe coyn'd to help my beggery
Deere love me not that you may love me more
Oh Grammer rules oh now your vertues showe
So Children still read you with awfull eyes
As my young Dove may in your precepts wise
Her graunt to me by her owne vertue knowe
For late with hart most hie with eyes most lowe
I crav'd the thing which ever she denies
Shee lightning Love displaying Venus skyes
Least one should not be heard twise said no no
Sing then my Muse now I do Paean sing
Heavens Envy not at my high triumphing
But Grammers force with sweete successe confirme
For Grammer sayes ah this deere Stella way
For Grammer sayes to Grammer who sayes nay
That in one speech two negatives affirme
No more my deere no more these Counsels try
O give my passions leave to runne their race
Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace
Let Folke orecharg'd with braine against me cry
Let Cloudes be dimme my face breake in my eye
Let me no steps but of lost labour try
Let all the earth in scorne recount my race
But doe not will me from my love to fly
I do not envie Aristotles wit
Nor do aspire to Caesars bleeding fame
Nor ought to care though some above me sit
Nor hope nor with another course to frame
But that which once may winne thy cruell hart
Thou art my wit and thou my vertue art
Love by sure proofe I may call thee unkinde
That gives no better cares to my just cryes
Thou whom to me such my good turnes shouldst binde
As I may well recount but none can prise
For when nak'd boy hou couldst no harbour finde
In this olde world growne now so to be wise
I lodg'de thee in my heart and being blinde
By nature borne I gave to thee my eyes
Mine eyes my light my life my hart alas
If so great services may scorned be
Yet let this thought thy Tygrish courage passe
That I perhaps am somewhat kin to thee
Since in thine armes if learn'd fame truth hath spred
Thou bearst the Arrowe I the Arrowhed
And doe I see some cause a hope to feede
Or doth the tedious burthen of long woe
In weakned mindes quick apprehension breede
Of every Image which may comfort showe
I cannot brag of word much lesse of deede
Fortune wheels still with me in one sort slowe
My wealth no more and no whit lesse my neede
Desier still on stilts of feare doth goe
And yet amids all feares a hope there is
Stolne to my hart since last faire night nay day
Stellas eyes sent to me the beames of blisse
Looking on mee while I looke other way
But when mine eyes backe to their heaven did move
They fled with blush which guiltie seem'd of love
Hope art thou true or doost thou flatter me
Doth Stella now beginne with pitteous eye
The raigne of this her conquest to espie
Will shee take time before all wracked be
Her eye speech is translated thus by thee
But failste thou not in phrase so heavenly hye
Looke on againe the faire text better prie
What blushing notes dost thou in Margent see
What sighes stolne out or kild before full borne
Hast thou found such and such like arguments
Or art thou els to comfort me forsworne
Well how so thou interpret the contents
I am resolv'd thy error to maintaine
Rather than by more trueth to get more paine
Stella the only Plannet of my light
Light of my life and life of my desire
Cheife good whereto my hope doth onely spire
World of my wealth and heaven of my delight
Why doost thou spend the Treasure of thy sprite
With voice more fit to wed Amphyons Lyre
Seeking to quench in me the noble fyre
Fed by thy worth and kindled by thy sight
And all in vaine for while thy breath most sweete
With choisest words thy words with reasons rare
Thy reasons firmely set are vertues feete
Labor to kill in me this killing care
Oh thinke I then what Paradise of joy
It is so faire a vertue to enjoye
Oh joy too high for my Love still to showe
Oh blisse fit for a nobler seat than mee
Envie put out thine eyes least thou doe see
What Oceans of delight in me doth flowe
My friend that oft saw'st through all maskes my woe
Come come and let me poure myself on thee
Gone is the winter of my miserie
My spring appeares o see what heere doth growe
For Stella hath with wordes where faith doth shine
Of her high hart given me the Monarchie
I I o I may say that she is mine
And though she give but thus condicionally
This Realme of blisse while vertues course I take
No Kings be Crownd but they some covenant make
My Muse may well grudge at my heavenly joy
Yf still I force her in sad rymes to creepe
She oft hath drunke my teares now hopes t'enjoy
Nectar of mirth since I loves Cup do keepe
Sonnets be not bound Prentice to annoy
Trebbles sing high so well as bases deepe
Griefe but Loves winter liverie is the boy
Hath cheekes to smile so well as eyes weepe
Come then my Muse shew the height of delight
In well raisde noates my pen the best it may
Shall paint out joy though but in blacke and white
Cease eager Muse peace pen for my sake stay
I give you heere my hand for truth of this
Wise silence is best Musique unto blisse
Who will in fayrest booke of nature know
How Vertue may best lodgde in Beautie bee
Let him but learne of love to read in thee
Stella those faire lines which true goodnes showe
There shall he finde all vices overthrowe
Not by rude force but sweetest soveraigntie
Of reason from whose light the night birdes flie
That inward Sunne in thine eyes shineth so
And not content to be perfections heir
Thy selfe doth strive all mindes that way to move
Who marke in thee what is in deede most faire
So while thy beautie drives my hart to love
As fast thy vertue bends that love to good
But ah Desire still cryes give me some food
Desire though thou mine olde companion art
And oft so clinges to my pure Love that I
One from the other scarcely can discry
While each doth blowe the fier of my hart
Now from thy fellowship I needs must part
Venus is taught with Dians wings to flye
I must no more in thy sweete passions lie
Vertues golde now must head my Cupids dart
Service and honour wonder with delight
Feare to offend well worthie to appeare
Care shining in mine eyes faith in my spright
These things are left me by my onely deare
But thou Desire because thou wouldst have all
Now banisht art yet alas how shall
Love still a Boy and oft a wanton is
Schoolde only by his Mothers tender eye
What wonder then if he his lesson misse
When for so soft a rod deare play he trye
And yet my starre because a sugred kisse
In sport I sucke while she a sleepe did lye
Doth lowre naye chide nay threat for onely this
Sweet it was saucy love not humble I
But no scuse serves she makes her wrath appeare
In Beauties throne see now who dares come neere
Those scarlet Judges threatning blooddie paine
O heavenly Foole thy most kisse worthy face
Anger invests with such a lovely grace
That Angers selfe I needes must kisse againe
I Never dranke of Aganippe well
Nor never did in shade of Tempe sit
And Muses scorne with vulgar braines to dwell
Poore Lay-man I for sacred rites unfit
Some doe I heare of Poets fury tell
But God wot wot not what they meane by it
And this I sweare by blackest brooke of hell
I am no Pickepurse of an others wit
How fals it than that with so smooth an ease
My thoughts I speake And what I speake doth flowe
In verse and that my verse best wittes doth please
Gesse we the cause What is it this fie no
Or so much lesse How then sure thus it is
My Lips are sure inspir'd with Stellas kisse
Of all the Kings that ever heere did raigne
Edward namde fourth as first in praise I name
Not for his faire outside nor well linde braine
Although lesse guift imp feathers oft no fame
Nor that he could young wise wise valliant frame
His Syres revenge joynde with a kingdomes gaine
And gaind by Mars could yet mad Mars so tame
That ballance waide what sword did late obtaine
Nor that he made the Flower de lys so fraide
Though strongly hedgd of bloody Lyons pawes
That wittie Lewes to him a tribuite paide
Nor this nor that nor any such small cause
But onely for this worthy King durst prove
To loose his Crowne rather then fayle his Love
Oh how the pleasant ayres of true love bee
Inflicted by those vapours which arise
From out that noysome gulfe which gaping lies
Betweene the jawes of hellish Jelousey
A Monster others harmes selfe misery
Beauties plague Vertues scurge succour of lyes
Who his owne joy to his owne heart applyes
And onely cherish doth with injuries
Who since he hath by natures speciall grace
So pearsing pawes as spoyle when they embrace
So nimble feete as stirre though still on thornes
So manie eyes aye seeking their owne woe
So ample eares that never good newes knowe
Is it not ill that such a divell wants hornes
Sweete kisse thy sweetes I faine would sweetely indite
Which even of sweetnes sweetest sweeter art
Pleasing'st consort where each sense holds a part
With coopling Doves guides Venus chariot right
Best charge and brav'st retraite in Cupids sight
A double key which openeth to the hart
Most ritch when most his ritches it imparte
Nest of yong joyes Scholemaster of delight
Teaching the meanes at once to take and give
The friendly fray where blowes do wound and heale
The prettie death while each in other live
Poore hopes first wealth a stage of promised weale
Breakefast of love but loe loe where shee is
Cease we to praise now praie wee for a kisse
Sweet swelling lip well maiest thou swell in pride
Since best wittes thinke it witt thee to admire
Natures praise vertues stall Cupids colde fire
Whence words not words but heavenly graces slide
The newe Pernassus where the Muses byde
Sweeteness of Musicke Wisomes beautifier
Breather of life and fastner of desire
Where Beauties blush in Honors graine is dyde
Thus much my hart compeld my mouth to say
But now spite of my heart my tongue will stay
Loathing al lyes doubting this flatterieis
And no spurre can this restie race renewe
Without how farre this praise is short of you
Sweete lipp you teach my mouth with one sweete kisse
O Kisse which doth those ruddie gemmes impart
Or Gemmes or fruits of new found Parradise
Breathing all blisse and sweetnes to the hart
Teaching dumbe lips a nobler exercise
O kisse which soules even soules together ties
By links of Love and onely natures Art
How faine would I paint thee to all mens eies
Or of thy gifts at least shade out some part
But shee forbids with blushing words shee saies
Shee builds her fame on higher seated praise
But my heart burnes I cannot silent be
Then since deare life you faine would have me peace
And I mad with delight want wit to cease
Stop you my mouth with still still kissing me
Nymph of the garden where all beauties be
Beauties which do in excellencie passe
His who till death lockt in a watry glasse
Or hirs whom nak'd the Trojan boy did see
Sweete garden Nymph that keepes the Cherrie tree
Whose fruit doth far the Hesperian tast surpasse
Most sweete faire most faire sweete do not alasse
From comming neere these Cherries banish mee
For though full of desire emptie of wit
Admitted late by your best graced grace
I caught at one of them an hungry bit
Pardon that fault once more graunt me the place
And so I sweare even by the same delite
I will but kisse I never more will bite
Good brother Philip I have forborne you long
I was content you should in favour creepe
While craftely you seemed your Cut to keepe
As though that faire soft hand did you great wrong
I beare with envy yet I heare your song
When in hir necke you did love ditties peepe
Nay more foole I oft suffred you to sleepe
In lillies nest where Loves selfe lies a long
What doth high place ambitious thoughts augment
Is saucines reward of curtesie
Cannot such grace your silly selfe content
But you must needes with those lips billing be
And through those lips drinke Nectar from that tung
Leave that Syr Phipp lest off your necke be wrung
High way since you my chiefe Pernassus be
And that my Muse to some eares not unmeete
Tempers her words to trampling horses feete
More often than to a Chamber melodie
Now blessed you beare onwards blessed me
To her where I my heart safeliest shall meete
My Muse and I must you of duetie greete
With thanks and wishes wishing thankfully
Be you still carefull kept by publike heede
By no encrochment wrongd nor time forgot
Nor blam'd for bloud nor sham'd for sinfull deede
And that you know I envie you no lot
Of highest wish I wish you so much blisse
Hundreds of yeares you Stellas feete may kisse
I see the house my harte thy selfe containe
Beware full Sailes drown not thy tottering Barge
Least joy by nature apt spirites to enlarge
Thee to thy wracke beyond thy limits straine
Nor doe like Lords whose weake confused braine
Not pointing to fit folks each undercharge
While every office themselves will discharge
With doing all leave nothing done but paine
But give apt servants their due place let eye
See beauties totall summe summ'd in their face
Let eares heare speach which will to wonder tye
Let breath suck up those sweetes let armes imbrace
The Globe of weale lipps Lov Indentures make
Thou but of all the kingly tribute take
Alas whence comes this change of lookes If I
have chang'd desert let mine owne conscience be
A still felt plague to selfe condemning mee
Let woe grype on my heart shame load mine eye
But if all faith like spotles Ermine lye
Safe in my soule which onely doth to thee
As his sole object of felicitie
With wings of Love in aire of wonder flie
O case your hand treat not so hard your slave
In Justice paines come not till faults do call
Or if I needs sweet Judge must torments have
Use something else to chasten mee withall
Than those blest eyes where all my hopes do dwell
No doome shall make ones Heaven become his Hell
When I was forst from Stella ever deare
Stella foode of my thoughts hart of my hart
Stella whose eyes make all my temples cleare
By Yron lawes of duetie to depart
Alas I found that shee with mee did smart
I sawe that teares did in her eyes appeare
I sawe that sighes her sweetest lips did part
And her sad words my sadded sense did heare
For mee I weepe to see Pearles scattered so
I sighd her sighes and wailed for her woe
Yet swamme in joy such love in her was seene
Thus while the effect most bitter was to mee
And nothing than that cause more sweet could be
I had beene vext if vext I had not beene
Out Traytour absence dar'st thou counsell mee
From my deare Captainnesse to runne away
Because in brave arraye here marcheth shee
That to winne mee oft showes a present paye
Is Faith so weake or is such force in thee
When Sunne is hid can Starres such beames displaie
Cannot Heavens foode once felt keepe stomacks free
From base desire on earthly cares to praie
Tush absence while thy mistes eclypse that light
My Orphan sense flyes to the inward sight
Where memorie settes foorth the beames of Love
That where before heart lov'd and eyes did see
In heart my sight and Love now coupled be
United powres make eche the stronger prove
Now that of absence the most yrksome night
With darkest shade doth overcome the daie
Since Stella eyes wont to give mee my daie
Leaving my Hemisphere leaves mee in night
Each day seemes long and longs for long staied night
The night as tedious wooes th'  of day
Tyr'd with the dustie toyles of busie day
Languisht with horrors of the silent night
Suffering the evils both of daie and night
While no night is more darke than is my day
Nor no day hath lesse quiet then my night
With such bad mixture of my night and daie
That living thus in blackest Winter night
I feele the flames of hottest Sommers daie
Stella thinke not that I by verse seeke fame
Who seeke who hope who love who like but thee
Thine eyes my pride thy lips my historie
If thou praise not all other praise is shame
Nor so ambitious am I as to frame
A nest for my yong praise in Lawrell tree
In trueth I sweare I wish not there should be
graved in my Epitaph a Poets name
Nor if I would could I just title make
That anie laud thereof to me should growe
Without my Plumes from others wings I take
For nothing from my wit or will doth flowe
Since all my words thy beautie doth indite
And Love doth hold my hand and makes me write
Stella while now by honours cruell might
I am from you light of my light misled
And that faire you my Sunne thus overspred
With absence vale I live in sorrowes night
If this darke place yet shewe by candle light
Some Beauties peece as amber collourd hed
Milke hands rose cheekes or lips more sweet more red
Or seeming jett black but in blacknes bright
They please I doe confesse they please mine eyes
But whie because of you they moddels be
Moddels such be wood globes of glistering skyes
Deare therefore be not jealous over me
If you heare that they seeme my heart to move
Not them no no but you in them I love
Be your words made good sir of Indean ware
That you allowe them mee by so small rate
Or do you cutted Spartanes imitate
Or do you meane my tender eares to spare
That to my questions you so totall are
When I demaund of Phoenix Stellas state
You say forsooth you left her well of late
O God thinke you that satisfies my care
I would know whether shee did sit or walke
How cloathd how waited on sighd shee or smilde
Whereof with whome how often did shee talke
With what pastimes times jorneys shee beguild
If her lips daine to sweeten my poore name
Saie all and all well said still say the same
O Fate o fault O curst child of my blisse
What sobs can give words grace my griefe to show
What inke is black enough to paint my woe
Through mee wretch mee even Stella vexed is
Yet Trueth if Caitives brath might call thee this
Witnes with mee that my fowle stumbling so
From carelesnes did in no manner growe
But wit confusd with too much care did misse
And do I then my selfe this vaine scuse give
I do sweete Love and know this harmed thee
The world quit mee shall I my self forgive
Onely with paines my paines thus eased be
That all thy hurtes in my hearts wracke I reed
I crye thy sighs my deare thy teares I bleed
Greefe find the words for thou hast made my braine
So darke with mistie vapours which arise
From out thy heavie mould that inbent eyes
Can scarce discerne the shape of mine owne paine
Do thou then for thou canst do thou complaine
For my poore soule which now that sicknes tries
Which even to sense sense of it selfe denies
Though harbengers of death lodge there his traine
Or if the love of plaint yet mind forbeares
As of a Caitife worthie so to dye
Yet waye thy selfe and wayle in causefull teares
That though in wretchednes thy life doth lie
Yet growest more wretched than thy nature beares
By being plast in such a wretch as I
Yet sighes deare sighes in deede true friends you are
That do not leave your least friend at the wurst
But as you with my brest I oft have nurst
So gratefull now you wait upon my care
Faint coward Joy no longer tarrie dare
Seeing hope yeeld when this woe strake him first
Delight exclaims he is for my fault curst
Although my mate in Armes himselfe he sware
Nay Sorrow comes with such mayne rage as hee
Kills his owne children Teares finding that they
By Love were made apt to comfort with mee
Onely true sighes you do not go away
Thank may you have for such thankfull part
Thank worthiest yet when you shall breake my heart
Though with good cause thou lik'st so well the night
Since kind or chaunce gives both one libertie
Both sadly blacke both blackly darkned be
Night bard from Sunne thou from thine own Sunnes light
Silence in both displaies his sullen might
Slowe Heavens in both do hold the one degree
That full of doubts thou of perplexitie
Thy teares expresse nights native moysture right
In both a wofull solitarines
In night of Spirites the gastly power sturr
And in our sprites are Spirits gastlines
But but alas nights sights the ods hath fure
For that at length invites us to some rest
Thou though still tyr'd yet still dost it detest
Dian that faine would cheare her friend the Night
Doth shewe her oft at full her fairest face
Bringing with her those starrie Nymphs whose chace
From heavenly standing hurts eche mortall wight
But ah poore Night in love with Phoebus light
And endlesly dispairing of his grace
Herselfe to shewe no other joy hath place
Sylent and sad in moorning weeds doth dight
Even so alas and Ladie Dians peere
With choise delight and rarest company
Would faine drive clouds from out my heavie cheere
But woe is me though joy her selfe were shee
Shee could not shewe my blind braine waies of joy
While I dispaire my Sunnes light to enjoy
Ah bed the feeld where joyes peace some do see
The feeld where al my thoughts to war be traind
How is thy grace by my strange fortune staind
How thy low shrowdes by my sighs stormed be
With sweet soft shades thou oft invitest mee
To steale some rest but wretch I am constrained
Spurd with Loves spurr this held and shortly rained
With Cares hard hand to runne and tosse in thee
While the black horrors of the silent night
Paint Woes black face so lively in my sight
That tedious leasure markes eache wrinckled line
But when Aurora leades out Phoebus daunce
Mine eyes then only winke for spite perchaunce
That wormes shou'd have their Sunne and I want mine
When farre spent night perswades each mortall eie
To whome nor Art nor Nature granted light
To lay his then marke wanting shaftes of sight
Clos'd whith their quivers in Sleeps armorie
With windowes ope then most my heart doth lye
Viewing the shape of darknes and delight
And takes that sad hue with which inward might
Of his mazde powres he keeps just harmony
But when birds chirpe aire and sweet aire which is
Mornes messenger with rose enameld skyes
Calls each wight to salute the heaven of blisse
Intombd of lids then buried are mine eyes
Forst by their Lord who is ashamd to find
Such light in sence with such a darkned mind
Oh teares no teares but shoures from beauties skyes
Making those Lilies and those Roses growe
Which aie most faire now fairer needs must show
While grateful pitty Beauty beautifies
Oh minded sighs that from that brest doe rise
Whose pants doe make unspilling Creame to flow
Winged with woes breath so doth Zephire blow
As might refresh the hel where my soule fries
Oh plaints conserv'd in such a surgred phrase
That eloquence envies and yet doth prayse
While sightd out words a perfect musicke gives
Such teares sighs plaints no sorrow is but joy
Or if such heavenly sighs must prove annoy
All mirth farewel let me in sorrow live
Stella is sicke and in that sick-bed lyes
Sweetenes that breathes and pants as oft as shee
And Grace sicke too such fine conclusions tries
That sicknes brings it selfe best grac'd to bee
Beautie is sicke but sicke in such faire guise
That in that palenes Beauties white we see
And Joy which is unsever'd from those eyes
Stella now learnes strange case to weepe with me
Love moves thy paine and like a faithful page
As thy looks sturre runs up and downe to make
All folkes prest at thy wil thy paine to swage
Nature with care seeks for his darlings sake
Knowing worlds passe ere she enough can finde
Of such heaven stuffe to cloath so heavenly minde
Where be those Roses which so sweetned earst our eyes
Where be those red cheekes which fair increase did frame
No hight of honor in the kindly badge of shame
Who hath the crimson weeds stoln from the morning skies
How doth the coullor fade of those vermillion eyes
Which Nature selfe did make and selfe engrave the same
I would know by what right this palenes overcame
That hue whose force my heart in so great thraldom ties
Gallens adopted sonnes who by a beaten way
Their judgements hackney on the fault of sicknes lay
But feeling proofe makes me say they mistake it sure
It is but love that makes this paper perfect white
To write therein more fresh the storie of Delight
Whiles Beauties reddest incke Venus for him doth stir
O happie Thames that didst my Stella beare
I saw thee with full many a smiling line
Upon thy cheereful face loves Livery weare
While those faire Plannets on thy streames did shine
The boat for joy could not to dance forbeare
While wanton winds with beautie so divine
Ravisht staid not til in her golden haire
They did themselves o sweetest prison twine
But faine those friendly winds there would their stay
Have made but forst by Nature still to flie
First did with puffing kisse those Lockes display
She so discovered blusht From window I
With sight thereof cride out Ah faire disgrace
Let honours selfe to thee graunt highest place
Envious wits what hath beene mine offence
That with such poisoned eare my wits you marke
That to each word nay sigh of mine you harke
As grudging me my sorrows eloquence
Ah is it not enough that I am thence
Thence so farre thence that scantly anie sparke
Of comfort dare come to this dungeon darke
Where rigorous exile lockes up al my sense
But if I by a happie window passe
If I but Starres uppon mine Armour beare
Sicke thirstie glad though but of empty glasse
Your morals note straight my hid meaning there
From out my ribs a whirlewind proves that I
Doe Stella love Fooles who doth it denie
Unhappie sight and hath shee vanisht by
So neere in so good time so free a place
Dead glasse dost thou thine object so imbrase
As what my hart still sees thou canst not spie
I sweare by hir Love and my lacke that I
Was not in fault that bent my dazling race
Onely unto the heaven of Stella face
Counting but dust that in her way did lie
But cease mine eyes your teares doe witnes well
That you guiltles therefore your necklace mist
Curst be the Page from whome the bad torch fell
Curst be the night which did your will resist
Curst be the Cochman that did drive so fast
With no lesse curse then absence makes me tast
O absent presence Stella is not here
False flattering hope that with so faire a face
Bare me in hand that in this Orphane place
Stella I saw my Stella should appeare
What saist thou now where is that dainty cleare
Thou wouldst mine eyes should helpe their famisht case
But how art thou now that selfe felt disgrace
Doth make me most to wish thy comfort neere
But heere I doe shore of faire Ladies meete
Who may with charme of conversation sweete
Make in my heavie mould new thoughts to grow
Sure they prevaile as much with me as he
That bad his frind but then new maimde to be
Merrie with him and so forget his woe
Stella since thou so right a Princesse art
Of all the Powers which life bestowe on me
That ere by them ought undertaken be
They first resort unto that soveraigne part
Sweete for a time give respite to my heart
Which pants as though it still should leape to thee
And on my thought give the Lieuetenancie
To this great cause which needes both wit and Art
And as a Queene who from her presence sends
Whom shee emploies dismisse from thee my wit
Still to have wrought that thy owne will attends
For servants shame of Maisters blame doth fit
O let not Fooles in me thy works approve
And scorning say see what it is to love
When sorrow using my owne Siers might
Melts downe his lead into my boyling brest
Through that darke Furnace of my heart opprest
There shines a joy from thee my onely light
But soone as thought of thee breeds my delight
And my young soule once flutters to her nest
Most dead dispaire my daily unbidden guest
Clips strait my wings strait wraps me in his night
And makes me then bow downe my head and say
Ah what doth Phoebus gold that wretch availe
Whom Iron darts doth keepe from use of daie
So strangely alas thy workes on me prevaile
That in my woes for thee thou art my joy
And in my joyes for thee my onel' anoy
For nowe syrs I am lyke as a prynce sholde be
I haue welth at wyll largesse and lyberte
Fortune to her lawys can not abandune me
But I shall of Fortune rule the reyne
I fere nothynge Fortunes perplexyte
All honour to me must nedys stowpe and lene
I synge of two partys without a mene
I haue wynde and wether ouer all to sayle
No stormy rage agaynst me can peruayle
Alexander of Macedony kynge
That all the oryent had in subieccyon
Though al his conquestys were brought to rekenynge
Myght seme ryght wel vnder my proteccyon
To rayne for all his marcyall affeccyon
For I am prynce perlesse prouyd of porte
Bathyd with blysse embracyd with comforte
Syrus that soleme syar of Babylon
That Israell releysyd of theyr captyuyte
For al his pompe for all his ryall trone
He may not be comparyd vnto me
I am the dyamounde dowtlesse of dygnyte
Surely it is I that all may saue and spyll
No man so hardy to worke agaynst my wyll
Porcenya the prowde prouoste of Turky lande
That ratyd the Romaynes and made them yll rest
Nor Cesar July that no man myght withstande
Were neuer halfe so rychely as I am drest
No that I assure you loke who was the best
I reyne in my robys I rule as me lyst
I dryue downe these dastardys with a dynt of my fyste
Of Cato the counte acountyd the cane
Daryus the doughty cheftayn of Perse
I set not by the prowdest of them a prane
Ne by non other that any man can rehersse
I folowe in felycyte without reuersse
I drede no daunger I dawnce all in delyte
My name is Magnyfycence man most of myght
Hercules the herdy with his stobburne clobbyd mase
That made Cerberus to cache the cur dogge of hell
And Thesius that prowde was Pluto to face
It wolde not become them with me for to mell
For of all barones bolde I bere the bell
Of all doughty I am doughtyest duke as I deme
To me all prynces to lowte man be sene
Cherlemayne that mantenyd the nobles of Fraunce
Arthur of Albyan for all his brymme berde
Nor Basyan the bolde for all his brybaunce
Nor Alerycus that rulyd the Gothyaunce by swerd
Nor no man on molde can make me aferd
What man is so maysyd with me that dare mete
I shall flappe hym as a fole to fall at my fete
Galba whom his galantys garde for agaspe
Nor Nero that nother set by God nor man
Nor Vaspasyan that bare in his nose a waspe
Nor Hanyball agayne Rome gates that ranne
Nor yet Cypyo that noble Cartage wanne
It is semynge your pleasure ye delyte
And to aqueynte you with carnall delectacyon
And to fall in aquayntaunce with euery newe facyon
And quyckely your appetytes to sharpe and adresse
To fasten your fansy vpon a fayre maystresse
That quyckly is enuyued with rudyes of the rose
Inpurtured with fetures after your purpose
The streynes of her vaynes as asure inde blewe
Enbudded with beautye and colour fresshe of hewe
As lyly whyte to loke vpon her leyre
Her eyen relucent as carbuncle so clere
Her mouthe enbawmed dylectable and mery
Her lusty lyppes ruddy as the chery
I wolde I had by hym that hell dyd harowe
With me in kepynge suche a Phylyp sparowe
I wolde hauke whylest my hede dyd warke
So I myght hobby for suche a lusty larke
These wordes in myne eyre they be so lustely spoken
That on suche a female my flesshe wolde be wroken
They towche me so thorowly and tykyll my consayte
That weryed I wolde be on suche a bayte
By waywarde wylfulnes let eche thynge be conuayed
What so euer ye do folowe your owne wyll
Be it reason or none it shall not gretely skyll
Be it ryght or wronge by the aduyse of me
Take your pleasure and vse free lyberte
And yf you se ony thynge agaynst your mynde
Then some occacyon of quarell ye must fynde
And frowne it and face it as thoughe ye wolde fyght
Frete yourselfe for anger and for dyspyte
Here no man what so euer they say
But do as ye lyst and take your owne way
Let your lust and lykynge stande for a lawe
Be wrastynge and wrythynge and away drawe
And ye se a man that with hym ye be not pleased
And that your mynde can not well be eased
As yf a man fortune to touche you on the quyke
Then feyne yourselfe dyseased and make yourselfe seke
To styre vp your stomake you must you forge
Call for a candell and cast vp your gorge
With Cockes armes rest shall I none haue
Tyll I be reuenged on that horson knaue
A howe my stomake wambleth I am all in a swete
Is there no horson that knaue that wyll bete
For ofte tymes suche a wamblynge goth ouer my harte
Yet I am not harte seke but that me lyst
For myrth I haue hym coryed beten and blyst
Hym that I loued not and made hym to loute
I am forthwith as hole as a troute
For suche abusyon I vse nowe and than
And let all your fansyes vpon them rest
Spare for no cost to gyue them pounde and peny
Better to make iii ryche than for to make many
Gyue them more than ynoughe and let them not lacke
And as for all other let them trusse and packe
Plucke from an hundred and gyue it to thre
Let neyther patent scape them nor fee
And where soeuer you wyll fall to a rekenynge
Those thre wyll be redy euen at your bekenynge
For then shall you haue at lyberte to lowte
Let them haue all and the other go without
Thus ioy without mesure you shall haue
That you hath punysshed with his sharpe rod
Goodhope your potecary assygned am I
That Goddes grace hath vexed you sharply
And payned you with a purgacyon of odyous pouerte
Myxed with bytter alowes of herde aduersyte
Nowe must I make you a lectuary softe
I to mynyster it you to receyue it ofte
With rubarbe of repentaunce in you for to rest
With drammes of deuocyon your dyet must be drest
With gommes goostly of glad herte and mynde
To thanke God of his sonde and comforte ye shal fynde
Put fro you presumpcyon and admyt humylyte
And hartely thanke God of your aduersyte
And loue that Lorde that for your loue was dede
Wounded from the fote to the crowne of the hede
For who loueth God can ayle nothynge but good
He may helpe you he may mende your mode
Prosperyte to hym is gyuen solacyusly to man
Aduersyte to hym therwith nowe and than
Helthe of body his besynesse to acheue
Dysease and sekenesse his conscyence to dyscryue
Afflyccyon and trouble to proue his pacyence
Contradyccyon to proue his sapyence
Grace of assystence his measure to declare
Somtyme to fall another tyme to beware
And nowe ye haue had syr a wonderous fall
To lerne you hereafter for to beware withall
Howe say you syr can ye these wordys grope
Grauyte of counsell prouydence and wyt
Your comfortable aduyse and wyt excedyth all gladnesse
But frendly I wyll refrayne you ferther or we flyt
Whereto were most metely my corage to knyt
Your myndys I beseche you here in to expresse
Commensynge this processe at mayster Redresse
Herein I wyll aforse me to shewe you my mynde
Fyrst from your magnyfycence syn must be abiectyd
In all your warkys more grace shall ye fynde
Be gentyll then of corage and lerne to be kynde
For of noblenesse the chefe poynt is to be lyberall
So that your largesse be not to prodygall
But wylfull waywardnesse muste walke out of the way
Measure of your lustys must haue the ouersyght
And not all the nygarde nor the chyncherde to play
Let neuer negarshyp your noblenesse affray
In your rewardys vse suche moderacyon
That nothynge be gyuen without consyderacyon
And fumously adresse you with magnanymyte
And euer let the drede of God be in your syght
And knowe your selfe mortall for all your dygnyte
Set not all your affyaunce in Fortune full of gyle
Remember this lyfe lastyth but a whyle
And Sad Cyrcumspeccyon I marke in my mynde
But Perseueraunce me semyth your probleme was best
I shall it neuer forget nor leue it behynde
But hooly to perseueraunce my selfe I wyll bynde
Of that I haue mysdone to make a redresse
And with sad cyrcumspeccyon correcte my vantonnesse
Comprehendyng the worlde casuall and transytory
Who lyst to consyder shall neuer be begylyd
Yf it be regystryd well in memory
A playne example of worldly vaynglory
Howe in this worlde there is no sekernesse
But fallyble flatery enmyxyd with bytternesse
Nowe well nowe wo nowe hy nowe lawe degre
Nowe ryche nowe pore nowe hole nowe in dysease
Nowe pleasure at large nowe in captyuyte
Nowe leue nowe lothe now please nowe dysplease
Now ebbe now flowe nowe increase now dyscrease
So in this worlde there is no sykernesse
But fallyble flatery enmyxyd with bytternesse
Shewyth nowe adayes howe the worlde comberyd is
To the pythe of the mater who lyst to resorte
To day it is well to morowe it is all amysse
To day in delyte to morowe bare of blysse
To day a lorde to morowe ly in the duste
Thus in this worlde there is no erthly truste
To day fayre wether to morowe a stormy rage
To day hote to morowe outragyous colde
To day a yoman to morowe made of page
To day in surety to morowe bought and solde
To day maysterfest to morowe he hath no holde
To day a man to morowe he lyeth in the duste
Thus in this worlde there is no erthly truste
Precely purposyd vnder pretence of play
Shewyth wysdome to them that wysdome can take
Howe sodenly worldly welth dothe dekay
How wysdom thorowe wantonnesse vanysshyth away
How none estate lyuynge of hymselfe can be sure
For the welthe of this worlde can not indure
Of the terestre rechery we fall in the flode
Beten with stormys of many a frowarde blast
Ensordyd with the wawys sauage and wode
Without our shyppe be sure it is lykely to brast
Yet of magnyfycence oft made is the mast
Thus none estate lyuynge of hym can be sure
For the welthe of this worlde can not indure
Arectyng my syght towarde the zodyake
The sygnes xii for to beholde a farre
When Mars retrogradant reuersyd his bak
Lorde of the yere in his orbicular
Put vp his sworde for he cowde make no warre
And whan Lucina plenarly did shyne
Scorpione ascendynge degrees twyse nyne
In place alone then musynge in my thought
How all thynge passyth as doth the somer flower
On euery halfe my reasons forthe I sought
How oftyn fortune varyeth in an howre
Now clere wether forthwith a stormy showre
All thynge compassyd no perpetuyte
But now in welthe now in aduersyte
So depely drownyd I was in this dumpe
Encraumpysshed so sore was my conceyte
That me to rest I lent me to a stumpe
Of an oke that somtyme grew full streyghte
A myghty tre and of a noble heyght
Whose bewte blastyd was with the boystors wynde
His leuis loste the sappe was frome the rynde
Thus stode I in the frytthy forest of Galtres
Ensowkid with sylt of the myry mose
Where hartis belluyng embosyd with distres
Ran on the raunge so longe that I suppose
Few men can tell now where the hynde calfe gose
Faire fall that forster that so well can bate his hownde
But of my purpose now torne we to the grownde
Whylis I stode musynge in this medytatyon
In slumbrynge I fell and halfe in a slepe
And whether it were of ymagynacyon
Or of humors superflue that often wyll crepe
Into the brayne by drynkyng ouer depe
Or it procedyd of fatall persuacyon
I can not wele tell you what was the occasyon
But sodeynly at ones as I me aduysed
As one in a trans or in an extasy
I sawe a pauylyon wondersly disgysede
Garnysshed fresshe after my fantasy
Enhachyde with perle and stones preciously
The grounde engrosyd and bet with bourne golde
That passynge goodly it was to beholde
Within it a prynces excellente of porte
But to recounte her ryche abylyment
And what estates to her did resorte
Therto am I full insuffycyent
A goddesse inmortall she dyd represente
As I harde say dame Pallas was her name
To whome supplyed the royall Quene of Fame
Prynces moost pusant of hygh preemynence
Renownyd lady aboue the sterry heuyn
All other transcendyng of very congruence
Madame regent of the scyence seuyn
To whos astate all noblenes most lenen
My supplycacyon to you I arrect
Whereof I beseche you to tender the effecte
Not vnremembered it is vnto your grace
How you gaue me a ryall commaundement
That in my courte Skelton shulde haue a place
Bycause that his tyme he studyously hath spent
In your seruyce and to the accomplysshement
Of your request regestred is his name
With laureate tryumphe in the courte of Fame
But good madame the accustome and vsage
Of auncient poetis ye wote full wele hath bene
Them selfe to embesy with all there holl corage
So that there workis myght famously be sene
In figure wherof they were the laurell grene
But how it is Skelton is wonder slake
And as we dare we fynde in hym grete lake
For ne were onely he hath your promocyon
Out of my bokis full sone I shulde hym rase
But sith he hath tastid of the sugred pocioun
Of Elyconis well refresshid with your grace
And wyll not endeuour hymselfe to purchase
The fauour of ladys with wordis electe
It is sittynge that ye must hym correct
The sum of your purpose as we ar aduysid
Is that our seruaunt is sum what to dull
Wherin this answere for hym we haue comprisid
How ryuers rin not tyll the spryng be full
Better a dum mouthe than a brainles scull
For if he gloryously pullishe his matter
Then men wyll say how he doth but flatter
And if so hym fortune to wryte true and plaine
As sumtyme he must vyces remorde
Then sum wyll say he hath but lyttill brayne
And how his wordes with reason wyll not accorde
Beware for wrytyng remayneth of recorde
Displease not an hundreth for one mannes pleasure
Who wryteth wysely hath a grete treasure
Also to furnisshe better his excuse
Ouyde was bannisshed for suche a skyll
And many mo whome I cowde enduce
Iuuenall was thret parde for to kyll
For certayne enuectyfys yet wrote he none ill
Sauynge he rubbid sum vpon the gall
It was not for hym to abyde the tryall
In generrall wordes I say not gretely nay
A poete somtyme may for his pleasure taunt
Spekyng in parablis how the fox the grey
The gander the gose and the hudge oliphaunt
Went with the pecok ageyne the fesaunt
The lesarde came lepyng and sayd that he must
With helpe of the ram ley all in the dust
Yet dyuerse ther be industryous of reason
Sum what wolde gadder in there coniecture
Of suche an endarkid chapiter sum season
How be it it were harde to construe this lecture
Sophisticatid craftely is many a confecture
Another manes mynde diffuse is to expounde
Yet harde is to make but sum fawt be founde
Madame with fauour of your benynge sufferaunce
Vnto your grace then make I this motyue
Whereto made ye me hym to auaunce
Vnto the rowme of laureat promotyue
Or wherto shulde he haue that prerogatyue
But if he had made sum memoryall
Wherby he myght haue a name inmortall
To pas the tyme in slowthfull ydelnes
Of your royall palace it is not the gyse
But to do sumwhat iche man doth hym dres
For how shulde Cato els be callyd wyse
But that his bokis whiche he did deuyse
Recorde the same or why is had in mynde
Plato but for that he left wrytynge behynde
For men to loke on Aristotille also
Of phylosophers callid the princypall
Olde Diogenes with other many mo
Demostenes that oratour royall
That gaue Eschines suche a cordyall
That bannisshed was he by his proposicyoun
Ageyne whome he cowde make no contradiccyoun
Soft my good syster and make there a pawse
And was Eschines rebukid as ye say
Remembre you wele poynt wele that clause
Wherfore then rasid ye not away
His name or why is it I you praye
That he to your courte is goyng and commynge
Sith he is slaundred for defaut of konnyng
Madame your apposelle is wele inferrid
And at your auauntage quikly it is
Towchid and hard for to be debarrid
Yet shall I answere your grace as in this
With your reformacion if I say amis
For but if your bounte did me assure
Myne argument els koude not longe endure
As towchyng that Eschines is remembred
That he so sholde be me semith it sittyng
All be it grete parte he hath surrendred
Of his onour whos dissuasyue in wrytyng
To corage Demostenes was moche excitynge
In settyng out fresshely his crafty persuacyon
From whiche Eschines had none euacyon
The cause why Demostenes so famously is brutid
Onely procedid for that he did outray
Eschines whiche was not shamefully confutid
But of that famous oratour I say
Whiche passid all other wherfore I may
Among my recordes suffer hym namyd
For though he were venquesshid yet was he not shamyd
As Ierome in his preamble Frater Ambrosius
Frome that I haue sayde in no poynt doth vary
Wherein he reporteth of the coragius
Wordes that were moch consolatory
By Eschines rehersed to the grete glory
Of Demostenes that was his vtter foo
Few shall ye fynde or none that wyll do so
A thanke to haue ye haue well deseruyd
Your mynde that can maynteyne so apparently
But a grete parte yet ye haue reseruyd
Of that most folow then conseqently
Or els ye demeane you inordinatly
For if ye laude hym whome honour hath opprest
Then he that doth worste is as good as the best
But whome that ye fauoure I se well hath a name
Be he neuer so lytell of substaunce
And whome ye loue not ye wyll put to shame
Ye counterwey not euynly your balaunce
As wele foly as wysdome oft ye do avaunce
For reporte ryseth many deuerse wayes
Sume be moche spokyn of for makynge of frays
Some haue a name for thefte and brybery
Some be called crafty that can pyke a purse
Some men be made of for their mokery
Some carefull cokwoldes some haue theyr wyues curs
Some famous wetewoldis and they be moche wurs
Some lidderons some losels some noughty packis
Some facers some bracers some make great crackis
Some dronken dastardis with their dry soules
Some sluggyssh slouyns that slepe day and nyght
Ryot and Reuell be in your courte rowlis
Maintenaunce and Mischefe theis be men of myght
Extorcyon is counted with you for a knyght
Theis people by me haue none assignement
Yet they ryde and rinne from Carlyll to Kente
But lytell or nothynge ye shall here tell
Of them that haue vertue by reason of cunnyng
Whiche souerenly in honoure shulde excell
Men of suche maters make but a mummynge
For wysdome and sadnesse be set out a sunnyng
And suche of my seruauntes as I haue promotyd
One faute or other in them shalbe notyd
Eyther they wyll say he is to wyse
Or elles he can nought bot whan he is at scole
Proue his wytt sayth he at cardes or dyce
And ye shall well fynde he is a very fole
Twyshe set hym a chare or reche hym a stole
To syt hym vpon and rede Iacke a thrummis bybille
For truly it were pyte that he sat ydle
To make repungnaunce agayne that ye haue sayde
Of very dwte it may not well accorde
But your benynge sufferaunce for my discharge I laid
For that I wolde not with you fall at discorde
But yet I beseche your grace that good recorde
May be brought forth suche as can be founde
With laureat tryumphe why Skelton sholde be crownde
For elles it were to great a derogacyon
Vnto your palas our noble courte of Fame
That any man vnder supportacyon
Withoute deseruynge shulde haue the best game
If he to the ample encrease of his name
Can lay any werkis that he hath compylyd
I am contente that he be not exylide
Frome the laureat senate by force of proscripcyon
Or elles ye know well I can do no lesse
But I most bannysshe hym frome my iurydiccyon
As he that aquentyth hym with ydilnes
But if that he purpose to make a redresse
What he hath done let it be brought to syght
Graunt my petycyon I aske you but ryght
To your request we be well condiscendid
Call forthe let se where is your clarionar
To blowe a blaste with his long breth extendid
Eolus your trumpet that knowne is so farre
That bararag blowyth in euery mercyall warre
Let hym blowe now that we may take a vewe
What poetis we haue at our retenewe
To se if Skelton wyll put hymselfe in prease
Amonge the thickeste of all the hole rowte
Make noyse enoughe for claterars loue no peas
Let se my syster now spede you go aboute
Anone I sey this trumpet were founde out
And for no man hardely let hym spare
To blowe bararag tyll bothe his eyne stare
Forthwith there rose amonge the thronge
A wonderfull noyse and on euery syde
They presid in faste some thought they were to longe
Sume were to hasty and wold no man byde
Some whispred some rownyd some spake and some cryde
With heuynge and shouynge haue in and haue oute
Some ranne the nexte way sume ranne abowte
There was suyng to the Quene of Fame
He plucked hym backe and he went afore
Nay holde thy tunge quod another let me haue the name
Make rowme sayd another ye prese all to sore
Sume sayd Holde thy peas thou getest here no more
A thowsande thowsande I sawe on a plumpe
With that I harde the noyse of a trumpe
That longe tyme blewe a full timorous blaste
Lyke to the boryall wyndes whan they blowe
That towres and townes and trees downe caste
Droue clowdes together lyke dryftis of snowe
The dredefull dinne droue all the rowte on a rowe
Some tremblid some girnid some gaspid some gasid
As people halfe peuysshe or men that were masyd
Anone all was whyste as it were for the nonys
And iche man stode gasyng and staryng vpon other
With that there come in wonderly at ones
A murmur of mynstrels that suche another
Had I neuer sene some softer some lowder
Orpheus the Traciane herped meledyously
Weth Amphion and other Musis of Archady
Whos heuenly armony was so passynge sure
So truely proporsionyd and so well did gree
So duly entunyd with euery mesure
That in the forest was none so great a tre
But that he daunced for ioye of that gle
The huge myghty okes them selfe dyd auaunce
And lepe frome the hylles to lerne for to daunce
In so moche the stumpe whereto I me lente
Sterte all at ones an hundrethe fote backe
With that I sprange vp towarde the tent
Of noble Dame Pallas wherof I spake
Where I sawe come after I wote full lytell lake
Of a thousande poetes assembled togeder
But Phebus was formest of all that cam theder
Of laurell leuis a cronell on his hede
With heris encrisped yalowe as the golde
Lamentyng Daphnes whome with the darte of lede
Cupyde hath stryken so that she ne wolde
Concente to Phebus to haue his herte in holde
But for to preserue her maidenhode clene
Transformyd was she into the laurell grene
Meddelyd with murnynge the moost parte of his muse
O thoughtfull herte was euermore his songe
Daphnes my derlynge why do you me refuse
Yet loke on me that louyd you haue so longe
Yet haue compassyon vpon my paynes stronge
He sange also how the tre as he did take
Betwene his armes he felt her body quake
Then he assurded into this exclamacyon
Vnto Diana the goddes inmortall
O mercyles madame hard is your constellacyon
So close to kepe your cloyster virgynall
Enhardid adyment the sement of your wall
Alas what ayle you to be so ouerthwhart
To bannysshe pyte out of a maydens harte
Why haue the goddes shewyd me this cruelte
Sith I contryuyd first princyples medycynable
I helpe all other of there infirmite
But now to helpe myselfe I am not able
That profyteth all other is nothynge profytable
Vnto me alas that herbe nor gresse
The feruent axes of loue can not represse
O fatall fortune what haue I offendid
Odious disdayne why raist thou me on this facyon
But sith I haue lost now that I entended
And may not atteyne it by no medyacyon
Yet in remembraunce of Daphnes transformacyon
All famous poetis ensuynge after me
Shall were a garlande of the laurell tre
This sayd a great nowmber folowyd by and by
Of poetis laureat of many dyuerse nacyons
Parte of there names I thynke to specefye

Theocritus with his bucolycall relacyons
Esiodus the iconomicar
And Homerus the fresshe historiar
Prynce of eloquence Tullius Cicero
With Salusty ageinst Lucius Catelyne
That wrote the history of Iugurta also
Ouyde enshryned with the Musis nyne
But blessed Bacchus the pleasant god of wyne
Of closters engrosyd with his ruddy flotis
These orators and poetes refresshed there throtis
Lucan with Stacius in Achilliedos
Percius presed forth with problemes diffuse
Virgill the Mantuan with his Eneidos
Iuuenall satirray that men makythe to muse
But blessed Bacchus the pleasant god of wyne
Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy flotes
These orators and poetes refreshed their throtes
There Titus Lyuius hymselfe dyd auaunce
With decadis historious whiche that he mengith
With maters that amount the Romayns in substaunce
Enyus that wrate of mercyall war at lengthe
But blessyd Bachus potenciall god of strengthe
Of clusters engrosid with his ruddy flotis
Theis orators and poetis refresshed there throtis
Aulus Gelius that noble historiar
Orace also with his new poetry
Mayster Terence the famous comicar
With Plautus that wrote full many a comody
But blessyd Bachus was in there company
Of clusters engrosyd with his ruddy flotis
Theis orators and poetis refresshed there throtis
Senek full soberly with his tragediis
Boyce recounfortyd with his philosophy
And Maxymyane with his madde ditiis
How dotynge age wolde iape with yonge foly

Theis orators and poetis refresshed there throtis
There came Johnn Bochas with his volumys grete
Quintus Cursius full craftely that wrate
Of Alexander and Macrobius that did trete
Of Scipions dreme what was the treu probate
But blessyd Bachus that neuer man forgate
Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy flotis
These orators and poetis refresshid ther throtis
Poggeus also that famous Florentine
Mustred ther amonge them with many a mad tale
With a frere of Fraunce men call sir Gagwyne
That frownyd on me full angerly and pale
But blessyd Bachus that bote is of all bale
Of clusters engrosyd with his ruddy flotis
Theis orators and poetis refresshid there throtis
Plutarke and Petrarke two famous clarkis
Lucilius and Valerius Maximus by name
With Vincencius in Speculo that wrote noble warkis
Propercius and Pisandros poetis of noble fame
But blissed Bachus that mastris oft doth frame
Of clusters engrosed with his ruddy flotis
Theis notable poetis refresshid there throtis
And as I thus sadly amonge them auysid
I saw Gower that first garnisshed our Englysshe rude
And maister Chaucer that nobly enterprysyd
How that our Englysshe myght fresshely be ennewed
The monke of Bury then after them ensuyd
Dane Johnn Lydgate theis Englysshe poetis thre
As I ymagenyd repayrid vnto me
Togeder in armes as brethern enbrasid
There apparell farre passynge beyonde that I can tell
With diamauntis and rubis there tabers were trasid
None so ryche stones in Turkey to sell
Thei wantid nothynge but the laurell
And of there bounte they made me godely chere
In maner and forme as ye shall after here
n Hellespont guilty of true-love blood
In view and opposite two cities stood
Sea-borderers disjoined by Neptune might
The one Abydos the other Sestos hight
At Sestos Hero dwelt Hero the fair
Whom young Apollo courted for her hair
And offered as a dower his burning throne
Where she should sit for men to gaze upon
The outside of her garments were of lawn
The lining purple silk with gilt stars drawn
Her wide sleeves green and bordered with a grove
Where Venus in her naked glory strove
To please the careless and disdainful eyes
Of proud Adonis that before her lies
Her kirtle blue whereon was many a stain
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain
Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath
From whence her veil reached to the ground beneath
Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives
Many would praise the sweet smell as she passed
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast
And there for honey bees have sought in vain
And beat from thence have lighted there again
About her neck hung chains of pebblestone
Which lightened by her neck like diamonds shone
She ware no gloves for neither sun nor wind
Would burn or parch her hands but to her mind
Or warm or cool them for they took delight
To play upon those hands they were so white
Buskins of shells all silvered used she
And branched with blushing coral to the knee
Where sparrows perched of hollow pearl and gold
Such as the world would wonder to behold
Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills
Which as she went would chirrup through the bills
Some say for her the fairest Cupid pined
And looking in her face was strooken blind
But this is true so like was one the other
As he imagined Hero was his mother
And oftentimes into her bosom flew
About her naked neck his bare arms threw
And laid his childish head upon her breast
And with still panting rocked there took his rest
So lovely fair was Hero Venus' nun
As Nature wept thinking she was undone
Because she took more from her than she left
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft
Therefore in sign her treasure suffered wrack
Since Hero time hath half the world been black
Amorous Leander beautiful and young
whose tragedy divine Musaeus sung
Dwelt at Abydos since him dwelt there none
For whom succeeding times make greater moan
His dangling tresses that were never shorn
Had they been cut and unto Colchos borne
Would have allured the vent'rous youth of Greece
To hazard more than for the golden fleece
Fair Cynthia wished his arms might be her sphere
Grief makes her pale because she moves not there
His body was as straight as Circe wand
Jove might have sipped out nectar from his hand
Even as delicious meat is to the taste
So was his neck in touching and surpassed
The white of Pelop shoulder I could tell ye
How smooth his breast was and how white his belly
And whose immortal fingers did imprint
That heavenly path with many a curious dint
That runs along his back but my rude pen
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men
Much less of powerful gods Let it suffice
That my slack Muse sings of Leander eyes
Those orient cheeks and lips exceeding his
That leaped into the water for a kiss
Of his own shadow and despising many
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any
Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen
Enamoured of his beauty had he been
His presence made the rudest peasant melt
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt
The barbarous Thracian soldier moved with nought
Was moved with him and for his favour sought
Some swore he was a maid in man attire
For in his looks were all that men desire
A pleasant smiling cheek a speaking eye
A brow for love to banquet royally
And such as knew he was a man would say
Leander thou art made for amorous play
Why art thou not in love and loved of all
Though thou be fair yet be not thine own thrall
The men of wealthy Sestos every year
For his sake whom their goddess held so dear
Rose-cheeked Adonis kept a solemn feast
Thither resorted many a wandering guest
To meet their loves Such as had none at all
Came lovers home from this great festival
For every street like to a firmament
Glistered with breathing stars who where they went
Frighted the melancholy earth which deemed
Eternal heaven to burn for so it seemed
As if another Phaeton had got
The guidance of the sun rich chariot
But far above the loveliest Hero shined
And stole away th' enchanted gazer mind
For like sea nymphs' enveigling Harmony
So was her beauty to the standers by
Nor that night-wandering pale and wat'ry star
When yawning dragons draw her thirling car
From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky
Where crowned with blazing light and majesty
She proudly sits more overrules the flood
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood
Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase
Wretched Ixion shaggy footed race
Incensed with savage heat gallop amain
From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain
So ran the people forth to gaze upon her
And all that viewed her were enamoured on her
And as in fury of a dreadful fight
Their fellows being slain or put to flight
Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead strooken
So at her presence all surprised and tooken
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes
He whom she favours lives the other dies
There might you see one sigh another rage
And some their violent passions to assuage
Compile sharp satires but alas too late
For faithful love will never turn to hate
And many seeing great princes were denied
Pin'd as they went and thinking on her died
On this feast day O cursed day and hour
Went Hero thorough Sestos from her tower
To Venus' temple where unhappily
As after chanced they did each other spy
So fair a church as this had Venus none
The walls were of discoloured jasper stone
Wherein was Proteus carved and o'erhead
A lively vine of green sea agate spread
Where by one hand lightheaded Bacchus hung
And with the other wine from grapes out wrung
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was
The town of Sestos called it Venus' glass
There might you see the gods in sundry shapes
Committing heady riots incest rapes
For know that underneath this radiant floor
Was Danae statue in a brazen tower
Jove slyly stealing from his sister bed
To dally with Idalian Ganymede
And for his love Europa bellowing loud
And tumbling with the Rainbow in a cloud
Blood quaffing Mars heaving the iron net
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set
Love kindling fire to burn such towns as Troy
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy
That now is turned into a cypress tree
Under whose shade the wood gods love to be
And in the midst a silver altar stood
There Hero sacrificing turtle blood
Vailed to the ground vailing her eyelids close
And modestly they opened as she rose
Thence flew Love arrow with the golden head
And thus Leander was enamoured
Stone still he stood and evermore he gazed
Till with the fire that from his countenance blazed
Relenting Hero gentle heart was strook
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look
It lies not in our power to love or hate
For will in us is overruled by fate
When two are stripped long ere the course begin
We wish that one should lose the other win
And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots like in each respect
The reason no man knows let it suffice
What we behold is censured by our eyes
Where both deliberate the love is slight
Who ever loved that loved not at first sight
He kneeled but unto her devoutly prayed
Chaste Hero to herself thus softly said
Were I the saint he worships I would hear him
And as she spake those words came somewhat near him
He started up she blushed as one ashamed
Wherewith Leander much more was inflamed
He touched her hand in touching it she trembled
Love deeply grounded hardly is dissembled
These lovers parleyed by the touch of hands
True love is mute and oft amazed stands
Thus while dumb signs their yielding hearts entangled
The air with sparks of living fire was spangled
And night deep drenched in misty Acheron
Heaved up her head and half the world upon
Breathed darkness forth dark night is Cupid day
And now begins Leander to display
Love holy fire with words with sighs and tears
Which like sweet music entered Hero ears
And yet at every word she turned aside
And always cut him off as he replied
At last like to a bold sharp sophister
With cheerful hope thus he accosted her
Fair creature let me speak without offence
I would my rude words had the influence
To lead thy thoughts as thy fair looks do mine
Then shouldst thou be his prisoner who is thine
Be not unkind and fair misshapen stuff
Are of behaviour boisterous and rough
O shun me not but hear me ere you go
God knows I cannot force love as you do
My words shall be as spotless as my youth
Full of simplicity and naked truth
This sacrifice whose sweet perfume descending
From Venus' altar to your footsteps bending
Doth testify that you exceed her far
To whom you offer and whose nun you are
Why should you worship her Her you surpass
As much as sparkling diamonds flaring glass
A diamond set in lead his worth retains
A heavenly nymph beloved of human swains
Receives no blemish but ofttimes more grace
Which makes me hope although I am but base
Base in respect of thee divine and pure
Dutiful service may thy love procure
And I in duty will excel all other
As thou in beauty dost exceed Love mother
Nor heaven nor thou were made to gaze upon
As heaven preserves all things so save thou one
A stately builded ship well rigged and tall
The ocean maketh more majestical
Why vowest thou then to live in Sestos here
Who on Love seas more glorious wouldst appear
Like untuned golden strings all women are
Which long time lie untouched will harshly jar
Vessels of brass oft handled brightly shine
What difference betwixt the richest mine
And basest mould but use For both not used
Are of like worth Then treasure is abused
When misers keep it being put to loan
In time it will return us two for one
Rich robes themselves and others do adorn
Neither themselves nor others if not worn
Who builds a palace and rams up the gate
Shall see it ruinous and desolate
Ah simple Hero learn thyself to cherish
Lone women like to empty houses perish
Less sins the poor rich man that starves himself
In heaping up a mass of drossy pelf
Than such as you His golden earth remains
Which after his decease some other gains
But this fair gem sweet in the loss alone
When you fleet hence can be bequeathed to none
Or if it could down from th'  sky
All heaven would come to claim this legacy
And with intestine broils the world destroy
And quite confound nature sweet harmony
Well therefore by the gods decreed it is
We human creatures should enjoy that bliss
One is no number maids are nothing then
Without the sweet society of men
Wilt thou live single still One shalt thou be
Though never singling Hymen couple thee
Wild savages that drink of running springs
Think water far excels all earthly things
But they that daily taste neat wine despise it
Virginity albeit some highly prize it
Compared with marriage had you tried them both
Differs as much as wine and water doth
Base bullion for the stamp sake we allow
Even so for men impression do we you
By which alone our reverend fathers say
Women receive perfection every way
This idol which you term virginity
Is neither essence subject to the eye
No nor to any one exterior sense
Nor hath it any place of residence
Nor is't of earth or mould celestial
Or capable of any form at all
Of that which hath no being do not boast
Things that are not at all are never lost
Men foolishly do call it virtuous
What virtue is it that is born with us
Much less can honour be ascribed thereto
Honour is purchased by the deeds we do
Believe me Hero honour is not won
Until some honourable deed be done
Seek you for chastity immortal fame
And know that some have wronged Diana name
Whose name is it if she be false or not
So she be fair but some vile tongues will blot
But you are fair ay me so wondrous fair
So young so gentle and so debonair
As Greece will think if thus you live alone
Some one or other keeps you as his own
Then Hero hate me not nor from me fly
To follow swiftly blasting infamy
Perhaps thy sacred priesthood makes thee loath
Tell me to whom mad'st thou that heedless oath
To Venus answered she and as she spake
Forth from those two tralucent cisterns brake
A stream of liquid pearl which down her face
Made milk-white paths whereon the gods might trace
To Jove high court He thus replied The rites
In which love beauteous empress most delights
Are banquets Doric music midnight revel
Plays masks and all that stern age counteth evil
Thee as a holy idiot doth she scorn
For thou in vowing chastity hast sworn
To rob her name and honour and thereby
Committ'st a sin far worse than perjury
Even sacrilege against her deity
Through regular and formal purity
To expiate which sin kiss and shake hands
Such sacrifice as this Venus demands
Thereat she smiled and did deny him so
As put thereby yet might he hope for moe
Which makes him quickly re-enforce his speech
And her in humble manner thus beseech
Though neither gods nor men may thee deserve
Yet for her sake whom you have vowed to serve
Abandon fruitless cold virginity
The gentle queen of love sole enemy
Then shall you most resemble Venus' nun
When Venus' sweet rites are performed and done
Flint-breasted Pallas joys in single life
But Pallas and your mistress are at strife
Love Hero then and be not tyrannous
But heal the heart that thou hast wounded thus
Nor stain thy youthful years with avarice
Fair fools delight to be accounted nice
The richest corn dies if it be not reaped
Beauty alone is lost too warily kept
These arguments he used and many more
Wherewith she yielded that was won before
Hero looks yielded but her words made war
Women are won when they begin to jar
Thus having swallowed Cupid golden hook
The more she strived the deeper was she strook
Yet evilly feigning anger strove she still
And would be thought to grant against her will
So having paused a while at last she said
Who taught thee rhetoric to deceive a maid
Ay me such words as these should I abhor
And yet I like them for the orator
With that Leander stooped to have embraced her
But from his spreading arms away she cast her
And thus bespake him Gentle youth forbear
To touch the sacred garments which I wear
Upon a rock and underneath a hill
Far from the town where all is whist and still
Save that the sea playing on yellow sand
Sends forth a rattling murmur to the land
Whose sound allures the golden Morpheus
In silence of the night to visit us
My turret stands and there God knows I play
With Venus' swans and sparrows all the day
A dwarfish beldam bears me company
That hops about the chamber where I lie
And spends the night that might be better spent
In vain discourse and apish merriment
Come thither As she spake this her tongue tripped
For unawares come thither from her slipped
And suddenly her former colour changed
And here and there her eyes through anger ranged
And like a planet moving several ways
At one self instant she poor soul assays
Loving not to love at all and every part
Strove to resist the motions of her heart
And hands so pure so innocent nay such
As might have made heaven stoop to have a touch
Did she uphold to Venus and again
Vowed spotless chastity but all in vain
Cupid beats down her prayers with his wings
Her vows above the empty air he flings
All deep enraged his sinewy bow he bent
And shot a shaft that burning from him went
Wherewith she strooken looked so dolefully
As made love sigh to see his tyranny
And as she wept her tears to pearl he turned
And wound them on his arm and for her mourned
Then towards the palace of the destinies
Laden with languishment and grief he flies
And to those stern nymphs humbly made request
Both might enjoy each other and be blest
But with a ghastly dreadful countenance
Threatening a thousand deaths at every glance
They answered Love nor would vouchsafe so much
As one poor word their hate to him was such
Hearken a while and I will tell you why
Heaven winged herald Jove-borne Mercury
The selfsame day that he asleep had laid
Enchanted Argus spied a country maid
Whose careless hair instead of pearl t'adorn it
Glistered with dew as one that seemed to scorn it
Her breath as fragrant as the morning rose
Her mind pure and her tongue untaught to gloze
Yet proud she was for lofty pride that dwells
In towered courts is oft in shepherds' cells
And too too well the fair vermilion knew
And silver tincture of her cheeks that drew
The love of every swain On her this god
Enamoured was and with his snaky rod
Did charm her nimble feet and made her stay
The while upon a hillock down he lay
And sweetly on his pipe began to play
And with smooth speech her fancy to assay
Till in his twining arms he locked her fast
And then he wooed with kisses and at last
As shepherds do her on the ground he laid
And tumbling in the grass he often strayed
Beyond the bounds of shame in being bold
To eye those parts which no eye should behold
And like an insolent commanding lover
Boasting his parentage would needs discover
The way to new Elysium but she
Whose only dower was her chastity
Having striv'n in vain was now about to cry
And crave the help of shepherds that were nigh
Herewith he stayed his fury and began
To give her leave to rise Away she ran
After went Mercury who used such cunning
As she to hear his tale left off her running
Maids are not won by brutish force and might
But speeches full of pleasure and delight
And knowing Hermes courted her was glad
That she such loveliness and beauty had
As could provoke his liking yet was mute
And neither would deny nor grant his suit
Still vowed he love She wanting no excuse
To feed him with delays as women use
Or thirsting after immortality -
All women are ambitious naturally -
Imposed upon her lover such a task
As he ought not perform nor yet she ask
A draught of flowing nectar she requested
Wherewith the king of gods and men is feasted
He ready to accomplish what she willed
Stole some from Hebe Hebe Jove cup filled
And gave it to his simple rustic love
Which being known as what is hid from Jove
He inly stormed and waxed more furious
Than for the fire filched by Prometheus
And thrusts him down from heaven He wandering here
In mournful terms with sad and heavy cheer
Complained to Cupid Cupid for his sake
To be revenged on Jove did undertake
And those on whom heaven earth and hell relies
I mean the adamantine Destinies
He wounds with love and forced them equally
To dote upon deceitful Mercury
They offered him the deadly fatal knife
That shears the slender threads of human life
At his fair feathered feet the engines laid
Which th' earth from ugly Chaos' den upweighed
These he regarded not but did entreat
That Jove usurper of his father seat
Might presently be banished into hell
And aged Saturn in Olympus dwell
They granted what he craved and once again
Saturn and Ops began their golden reign
Murder rape war lust and treachery
Were with Jove closed in Stygian empery
But long this blessed time continued not
As soon as he his wished purpose got
He reckless of his promise did despise
The love of th' everlasting Destinies
They seeing it both love and him abhorred
And Jupiter unto his place restored
And but that Learning in despite of Fate
Will mount aloft and enter heaven gate
And to the seat of Jove itself advance
Hermes had slept in hell with Ignorance
Yet as a punishment they added this
That he and Poverty should always kiss
And to this day is every scholar poor
Gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor
Likewise the angry Sisters thus deluded
To venge themselves on Hermes have concluded
That Midas' brood shall sit in honour chair
To which the Muses' sons are only heir
And fruitful wits that in aspiring are
Shall discontent run into regions far
And few great lords in virtuous deeds shall joy
But be surprised with every garish toy
And still enrich the lofty servile clown
Who with encroaching guile keeps learning down
Then Muse not Cupid suit no better sped
Seeing in their loves the Fates were injured
By this sad Hero with love unacquainted
Viewing Leander face fell down and fainted
He kissed her and breathed life into her lips
Wherewith as one displeased away she trips
Yet as she went full often looked behind
And many poor excuses did she find
To linger by the way and once she stayed
And would have turned again but was afraid
In offering parley to be counted light
So on she goes and in her idle flight
Her painted fan of curled plumes let fall
Thinking to train Leander therewithal
He being a novice knew not what she meant
But stayed and after her a letter sent
Which joyful Hero answered in such sort
As he had hope to scale the beauteous fort
Wherein the liberal Graces locked their wealth
And therefore to her tower he got by stealth
Wide open stood the door he need not climb
And she herself before the pointed time
Had spread the board with roses strowed the room
And oft looked out and mused he did not come
At last he came O who can tell the greeting
These greedy lovers had at their first meeting
He asked she gave and nothing was denied
Both to each other quickly were affied
Look how their hands so were their hearts united
And what he did she willingly requited
Sweet are the kisses the embracements sweet
When like desires and affections meet
For from the earth to heaven is Cupid raised
Where fancy is in equal balance peised
Yet she this rashness suddenly repented
And turned aside and to herself lamented
As if her name and honour had been wronged
By being possessed of him for whom she longed
Ay and she wished albeit not from her heart
That he would leave her turret and depart
The mirthful god of amorous pleasure smiled
To see how he this captive nymph beguiled
For hitherto he did but fan the fire
And kept it down that it might mount the higher
Now waxed she jealous lest his love abated
Fearing her own thoughts made her to be hated
Therefore unto him hastily she goes
And like light Salmacis her body throws
Upon his bosom where with yielding eyes
She offers up herself a sacrifice
To slake his anger if he were displeased
O what god would not therewith be appeased
Like Aesop cock this jewel he enjoyed
And as a brother with his sister toyed
Supposing nothing else was to be done
Now he her favour and good will had won
But know you not that creatures wanting sense
By nature have a mutual appetence
And wanting organs to advance a step
Moved by love force unto each other lep
Much more in subjects having intellect
Some hidden influence breeds like effect
Albeit Leander rude in love and raw
Long dallying with Hero nothing saw
That might delight him more yet he suspected
Some amorous rites or other were neglected
Therefore unto his body hers he clung
She fearing on the rushes to be flung
Strived with redoubled strength the more she strived
The more a gentle pleasing heat revived
Which taught him all that elder lovers know
And now the same gan so to scorch and glow
As in plain terms yet cunningly he craved it
Love always makes those eloquent that have it
She with a kind of granting put him by it
And ever as he thought himself most nigh it
Like to the tree of Tantalus she fled
And seeming lavish saved her maidenhead
Ne'er king more sought to keep his diadem
Than Hero this inestimable gem
Above our life we love a steadfast friend
Yet when a token of great worth we send
We often kiss it often look thereon
And stay the messenger that would be gone
No marvel then though Hero would not yield
So soon to part from that she dearly held
Jewels being lost are found again this never
'Tis lost but once and once lost lost forever
Now had the morn espied her lover steeds
Whereat she starts puts on her purple weeds
And red for anger that he stayed so long
All headlong throws herself the clouds among
And now Leander fearing to be missed
Embraced her suddenly took leave and kissed
Long was he taking leave and loath to go
And kissed again as lovers use to do
Sad Hero wrung him by the hand and wept
Saying Let your vows and promises be kept
Then standing at the door she turned about
As loath to see Leander going out
And now the sun that through th' horizon peeps
As pitying these lovers downward creeps
So that in silence of the cloudy night
Though it was morning did he take his flight
But what the secret trusty night concealed
Leander amorous habit soon revealed
With Cupid myrtle was his bonnet crowned
About his arms the purple riband wound
Wherewith she wreathed her largely spreading hair
Nor could the youth abstain but he must wear
The sacred ring wherewith she was endowed
When first religious chastity she vowed
Which made his love through Sestos to be known
And thence unto Abydos sooner blown
Than he could sail for incorporeal fame
Whose weight consists in nothing but her name
Is swifter than the wind whose tardy plumes
Are reeking water and dull earthly fumes
Home when he came he seemed not to be there
But like exiled air thrust from his sphere
Set in a foreign place and straight from thence
Alcides like by mighty violence
He would have chased away the swelling main
That him from her unjustly did detain
Like as the sun in a diameter
Fires and inflames objects removed far
And heateth kindly shining laterally
So beauty sweetly quickens when 'tis nigh
But being separated and removed
Burns where it cherished murders where it loved
Therefore even as an index to a book
So to his mind was young Leander look
O none but gods have power their love to hide
Affection by the countenance is descried
The light of hidden fire itself discovers
And love that is concealed betrays poor lovers
His secret flame apparently was seen
Leander father knew where he had been
And for the same mildly rebuked his son
Thinking to quench the sparkles new begun
But love resisted once grows passionate
And nothing more than counsel lovers hate
For as a hot proud horse highly disdains
To have his head controlled but breaks the reins
Spits forth the ringled bit and with his hooves
Checks the submissive ground so he that loves
The more he is restrained the worse he fares
What is it now but mad Leander dares
O Hero Hero thus he cried full oft
And then he got him to a rock aloft
Where having spied her tower long stared he on't
And prayed the narrow toiling Hellespont
To part in twain that he might come and go
But still the rising billows answered No
With that he stripped him to the ivory skin
And crying Love I come leaped lively in
Whereat the sapphire visaged god grew proud
And made his capering Triton sound aloud
Imagining that Ganymede displeased
Had left the heavens therefore on him he seized
Leander strived the waves about him wound
And pulled him to the bottom where the ground
Was strewed with pearl and in low coral groves
Sweet singing mermaids sported with their loves
On heaps of heavy gold and took great pleasure
To spurn in careless sort the shipwrack treasure
For here the stately azure palace stood
Where kingly Neptune and his train abode
The lusty god embraced him called him Love
And swore he never should return to Jove
But when he knew it was not Ganymede
For under water he was almost dead
He heaved him up and looking on his face
Beat down the bold waves with his triple mace
Which mounted up intending to have kissed him
And fell in drops like tears because they missed him
Leander being up began to swim
And looking back saw Neptune follow him
Whereat aghast the poor soul 'gan to cry
O let me visit Hero ere I die
The god put Helle bracelet on his arm
And swore the sea should never do him harm
He clapped his plump cheeks with his tresses played
And smiling wantonly his love bewrayed
He watched his arms and as they opened wide
At every stroke betwixt them would he slide
And steal a kiss and then run out and dance
And as he turned cast many a lustful glance
And threw him gaudy toys to please his eye
And dive into the water and there pry
Upon his breast his thighs and every limb
And up again and close beside him swim
And talk of love Leander made reply
You are deceived I am no woman I
Thereat smiled Neptune and then told a tale
How that a shepherd sitting in a vale
Played with a boy so fair and kind
As for his love both earth and heaven pined
That of the cooling river durst not drink
Lest water nymphs should pull him from the brink
And when he sported in the fragrant lawns
Goat footed satyrs and upstaring fauns
Would steal him thence Ere half this tale was done
Ay me Leander cried th' enamoured sun
That now should shine on Thetis' glassy bower
Descends upon my radiant Hero tower
O that these tardy arms of mine were wings
And as he spake upon the waves he springs
Neptune was angry that he gave no ear
And in his heart revenging malice bare
He flung at him his mace but as it went
He called it in for love made him repent
The mace returning back his own hand hit
As meaning to be venged for darting it
When this fresh bleeding wound Leander viewed
His colour went and came as if he rued
The grief which Neptune felt In gentle breasts
Relenting thoughts remorse and pity rests
And who have hard hearts and obdurate minds
But vicious harebrained and illiterate hinds
The god seeing him with pity to be moved
Thereon concluded that he was beloved
Love is too full of faith too credulous
With folly and false hope deluding us
Wherefore Leander fancy to surprise
To the rich Ocean for gifts he flies
'Tis wisdom to give much a gift prevails
When deep persuading oratory fails
By this Leander being near the land
Cast down his weary feet and felt the sand
Breathless albeit he were he rested not
Till to the solitary tower he got
And knocked and called At which celestial noise
The longing heart of Hero much more joys
Than nymphs and shepherds when the timbrel rings
Or crooked dolphin when the sailor sings
She stayed not for her robes but straight arose
And drunk with gladness to the door she goes
Where seeing a naked man she screeched for fear
Such sights as this to tender maids are rare
And ran into the dark herself to hide
Rich jewels in the dark are soonest spied
Unto her was he led or rather drawn
By those white limbs which sparkled through the lawn
The nearer that he came the more she fled
And seeking refuge slipped into her bed
Whereon Leander sitting thus began
Through numbing cold all feeble faint and wan
If not for love yet love for pity sake
Me in thy bed and maiden bosom take
At least vouchsafe these arms some little room
Who hoping to embrace thee cheerly swum
This head was beat with many a churlish billow
And therefore let it rest upon thy pillow
Herewith affrighted Hero shrunk away
And in her lukewarm place Leander lay
Whose lively heat like fire from heaven fet
Would animate gross clay and higher set
The drooping thoughts of base declining souls
Than dreary Mars carousing nectar bowls
His hands he cast upon her like a snare
She overcome with shame and sallow fear
Like chaste Diana when Actaeon spied her
Being suddenly betrayed dived down to hide her
And as her silver body downward went
With both her hands she made the bed a tent
And in her own mind thought herself secure
O'ercast with dim and darksome coverture
And now she lets him whisper in her ear
Flatter entreat promise protest and swear
Yet ever as he greedily assayed
To touch those dainties she the harpy played
And every limb did as a soldier stout
Defend the fort and keep the foeman out
For though the rising ivory mount he scaled
Which is with azure circling lines empaled
Much like a globe a globe may I term this
By which love sails to regions full of bliss
Yet there with Sisyphus he toiled in vain
Till gentle parley did the truce obtain
Wherein Leander on her quivering breast
Breathless spoke something and sighed out the rest
Which so prevailed as he with small ado
Enclosed her in his arms and kissed her too
And every kiss to her was as a charm
And to Leander as a fresh alarm
So that the truce was broke and she alas
Poor silly maiden at his mercy was
Love is not full of pity as men say
But deaf and cruel where he means to prey
Even as a bird which in our hands we wring
Forth plungeth and oft flutters with her wing
She trembling strove This strife of hers like that
Which made the world another world begat
Of unknown joy Treason was in her thought
And cunningly to yield herself she sought
Seeming not won yet won she was at length
In such wars women use but half their strength
Leander now like Theban Hercules
Entered the orchard of th' Hesperides
Whose fruit none rightly can describe but he
That pulls or shakes it from the golden tree
And now she wished this night were never done
And sighed to think upon th' approaching sun
For much it grieved her that the bright daylight
Should know the pleasure of this blessed night
And them like Mars and Erycine display
Both in each other arms chained as they lay
Again she knew not how to frame her look
Or speak to him who in a moment took
That which so long so charily she kept
And fain by stealth away she would have crept
And to some corner secretly have gone
Leaving Leander in the bed alone
But as her naked feet were whipping out
He on the sudden clinged her so about
That mermaid-like unto the floor she slid
One half appeared the other half was hid
Thus near the bed she blushing stood upright
And from her countenance behold ye might
A kind of twilight break which through the hair
As from an orient cloud glimpsed here and there
And round about the chamber this false morn
Brought forth the day before the day was born
So Hero ruddy cheek Hero betrayed
And her all naked to his sight displayed
Whence his admiring eyes more pleasure took
Than Dis on heaps of gold fixing his look
By this Apollo golden harp began
To sound forth music to the ocean
Which watchful Hesperus no sooner heard
But he the bright day-bearing car prepared
And ran before as harbinger of light
And with his flaring beams mocked ugly night
Till she o'ercome with anguish shame and rage
Danged down to hell her loathsome carriage
WHat man that sees the euer-whirling wheele
Of Change the which all mortall things doth sway
But that therby doth find plainly feele
How MVTABILITY in them doth play
Her cruell sports to many mens decay
Which that to all may better yet appeare
I will rehearse that whylome I heard say
How she at first her selfe began to reare
Gainst all the Gods and th'  sought from them to beare
But first here falleth fittest to vnfold
Her antique race and linage ancient
As I haue found it registred of old
In Faery Land mongst records permanent
She was to weet a daughter by descent
Of those old Titans that did whylome striue
with Saturnes sonne for heauens regiment
Whom though high Ioue of kingdome did depriue
Yet many of their stemme long after did surviue
And many of them afterwards obtain'd
Great power of Ioue and high authority
As Hecate in whose almighty hand
He plac't all rule and principality
To be by her disposed diuersly
To Gods and men as she them list diuide
And drad Bellona that doth sound on hie
Warres and allarums vnto Nations wide
That makes both heauen earth to tremble at her pride
So likewise did this Titanesse aspire
Rule and dominion to her selfe to gaine
That as a Goddesse men might her admire
And heauenly honours yield as to them twaine
At first on earth she sought it to obtaine
Where she such proofe and sad examples shewed
Of her great power to many ones great paine
That not men onely whom she soone subdewed
But eke all other creatures her bad dooings rewed
For she the face of earthly things so changed
That all which Nature had establisht first
In good estate and in meet order ranged
She did pervert and all their statutes burst
And all the worlds faire frame which none yet durst
Of Gods or men to alter or misguide
She alter'd quite and made them all accurst
That God had blest and did at first prouide
In that still happy state for euer to abide
Ne shee the lawes of Nature onely brake
But eke of Iustice and of Policie
And wrong of right and bad of good did make
And death for life exchanged foolishlie
Since which all liuing wights haue learn'd to die
And all this world is woxen daily worse
Of pittious worke of MVTABILITIE
By which we all are subiect to that curse
And death in stead of life haue sucked from our Nurse
And now when all the earth she thus had brought
To her behest and thralled to her might
She gan to cast in her ambitious thought
T'attempt the empire of the heauens hight
And Ioue himselfe to shoulder from his right
And first she past the region of the ayre
And of the fire whose substance thin and slight
Made no resistance ne could her contraire
But ready passage to her pleasure did prepaire
Thence to the Circle of the Moone she clambe
Where Cynthia raignes in euerlasting glory
To whose bright shining palace straight she came
All fairely deckt with heauens goodly story
Whose siluer gates by which there sate an hory
Old aged Sire with hower-glasse in hand
Hight Tyme she entred were he liefe or sory
Ne staide till she the highest stage had scand
where Cynthia did sit that neuer still did stand
Her sitting on an Iuory throne shee found
Drawne of two steeds th'  black the other white
Environd with tenne thousand starres around
That duly her attended day and night
And by her side there ran her Page that hight
Vesper whom we the Euening-starre intend
That with his Torche still twinkling like twylight
Her lightened all the way where she should wend
And ioy to weary wandring trauailers did lend
That when the hardy Titanesse beheld
The goodly building of her Palace bright
Made of the heauens substance and vp-held
With thousand Crystall pillors of huge hight
Shee gan to burne in her ambitious spright
And t'envie her that in such glorie raigned
Eftsoones she cast by force and tortious might
Her to displace and to her selfe to haue gained
The kingdome of the Night and waters by her wained
Boldly she bid the Goddesse downe descend
And let her selfe into that Ivory throne
For shee her selfe more worthy thereof wend
And better able it to guide alone
Whether to men whose fall she did bemone
Or vnto Gods whose state she did maligne
Or to th'  Powers her need giue lone
Of her faire light and bounty most benigne
Her selfe of all that rule shee deemed most condigne
But shee that had to her that soueraigne seat
By highest Ioue assign'd therein to beare
Nights burning lamp regarded not her threat
Ne yielded ought for fauour or for feare
But with sterne countenaunce and disdainfull cheare
Bending her horned browes did put her back
And boldly blaming her for comming there
Bade her attonce from heauens coast to pack
Or at her perill bide the wrathfull Thunders wrack
Yet nathemore the Giantesse forbare
But boldly preacing-on raught forth her hand
To pluck her downe perforce from off her chaire
And there-with lifting vp her golden wand
Threatned to strike her if she did with-stand
Whereat the starres which round about her blazed
And eke the Moones bright wagon still did stand
All beeing with so bold attempt amazed
And on her vncouth habit and sterne looke still gazed
Meane-while the lower World which nothing knew
Of all that chaunced here was darkned quite
And eke the heauens and all the heauenly crew
Of happy wights now vnpurvaide of light
Were much afraid and wondred at that sight
Fearing least Chaos broken had his chaine
And brought againe on them eternall night
But chiefely Mercury that next doth raigne
Ran forth in haste vnto the king of Gods to plaine
All ran together with a great out-cry
To Ioues faire Palace fixt in heauens hight
And beating at his gates full earnestly
Gan call to him aloud with all their might
To know what meant that suddaine lack of light
The father of the Gods when this he heard
Was troubled much at their so strange affright
Doubting least Typhon were againe vprear'd
Or other his old foes that once him sorely fear'd
Eftsoones the sonne of Maia forth he sent
Downe to the Circle of the Moone to knowe
The cause of this so strange astonishment
And why shee did her wonted course forslowe
And if that any were on earth belowe
That did with charmes or Magick her molest
Him to attache and downe to hell to throwe
But if from heauen it were then to arrest
The Author and him bring before his presence prest
The wingd-foot God so fast his plumes did beat
That soone he came where-as the Titanesse
Was striuing with faire Cynthia for her seat
At whose strange sight and haughty hardinesse
He wondred much and feared her no lesse
Yet laying feare aside to doe his charge
At last he bade her with bold stedfastnesse
Ceasse to molest the Moone to walke at large
Or come before high Ioue her dooings to discharge
And there-with-all he on her shoulder laid
His snaky-wreathed Mace whose awfull power
Doth make both Gods and hellish fiends affraid
Where-at the Titanesse did sternely lower
And stoutly answer'd that in euill hower
He from his Ioue such message to her brought
To bid her leaue faire Cynthias siluer bower
Sith shee his Ioue and him esteemed nought
No more then Cynthia selfe but all their kingdoms sought
The Heauens Herald staid not to reply
But past away his doings to relate
Vnto his Lord who now in th'  sky
was placed in his principall Estate
with all the Gods about him congregate
To whom when Hermes had his message told
It did them all exceedingly amate
Saue Ioue who changing nought his count'nance bold
Did vnto them at length these speeches wise vnfold
Harken to mee awhile yee heauenly Powers
Ye may remember since th'  cursed seed
Sought to assaile the heauens eternall towers
And to vs all exceeding feare did breed
But how we then defeated all their deed
Yee all doe knowe and them destroied quite
Yet not so quite but that there did succeed
An off-spring of their bloud which did alite
Vpon the fruitfull earth which doth vs yet despite
Of that bad seed is this bold woman bred
That now with bold presumption doth aspire
To thrust faire Phoebe from her siluer bed
And eke our selues from heauens high Empire
If that her might were match to her desire
Wherefore it now behoues vs to advise
What way is best to driue her to retire
Whether by open force or counsell wise
Areed ye sonnes of God as best ye can deuise
So hauing said he ceast and with his brow
His black eye-brow whose doomefull dreaded beck
Is wont to wield the world vnto his vow
And euen the highest Powers of heauen to check
Made signe to them in their degrees to speake
Who straight gan cast their counsell graue and wise
Meane-while th'  daughter thogh she nought did reck
Of Hermes message yet gan now advise
What course were best to take in this hot bold emprize
Eftsoones she thus resolv'd that whil'st the Gods
After returne of Hermes Embassie
Were troubled and amongst themselues at ods
Before they could new counsels re-allie
To set vpon them in that extasie
And take what fortune time and place would lend
So forth she rose and through the purest sky
To Ioues high Palace straight cast to ascend
To prosecute her plot Good on-set boads good end
Shee there arriuing boldly in did pass
Where all the Gods she found in counsell close
All quite vnarm'd as then their manner was
At sight of her they suddaine all arose
In great amaze ne wist what way to chose
But Ioue all fearelesse forc't them to aby
And in his soueraine throne gan straight dispose
Himselfe more full of grace and Maiestie
That mote encheare his friends foes mote terrifie
That when the haughty Titanesse beheld
All were she fraught with pride and impudence
Yet with the sight thereof was almost queld
And inly quaking seem'd as reft of sense
And voyd of speech in that drad audience
Vntill that Ioue himselfe her selfe bespake
Speake thou fraile woman speake with confidence
Whence art thou and what doost thou here now make
What idle errand hast thou earths mansion to forsake
Shee halfe confused with his great commaund
Yet gathering spirit of her natures pride
Him boldly answer'd thus to his demaund
I am a daughter by the mothers side
Of her that is Grand-mother magnifide
Of all the Gods great Earth great Chaos child
But by the fathers be it not envide
I greater am in bloud whereon I build
Then all the Gods though wrongfully from heauen exil'd
For Titan as ye all acknowledge must
Was Saturnes elder brother by birth-right
Both sonnes of Vranus but by vniust
And guilefull meanes through Corybantes slight
The younger thrust the elder from his right
Since which thou Ioue iniuriously hast held
The Heauens rule from Titans sonnes by might
And them to hellish dungeons downe hast feld
Witnesse ye Heauens the truth of all that I haue teld
Whil'st she thus spake the Gods that gaue good eare
To her bold words and marked well her grace
Beeing of stature tall as any there
Of all the Gods and beautifull of face
As any of the Goddesses in place
Stood all astonied like a sort of Steeres
Mongst whom some beast of strange forraine race
Vnwares is chaunc't far straying from his peeres
So did their ghastly gaze bewray their hidden feares
Till hauing pauz'd awhile Ioue thus bespake
will neuer mortall thoughts ceasse to aspire
In this bold sort to Heauen claime to make
And touch celestiall seates with earthly mire
I would haue thought that bold Procrustes hire
Or Typhons fall or proud Ixions paine
Or great Prometheus tasting of our ire
Would haue suffiz'd the rest for to restraine
And warn'd all men by their example to refraine
But now this off-scum of that cursed fry
Dare to renew the like bold enterprize
And chalenge th'  of this our skie
Whom what should hinder but that we likewise
Should handle as the rest of her allies
And thunder-driue to hell With that he shooke
His Nectar-deawed locks with which the skyes
And all the world beneath for terror quooke
And eft his burning levin-brond in hand he tooke
But when he looked on her louely face
In which faire beames of beauty did appeare
That could the greatest wrath soone turne to grace
Such sway doth beauty euen in Heauen beare
He staide his hand and hauing chang'd his cheare
He thus againe in milder wise began
But ah if Gods should striue with flesh yfere
Then shortly should the progeny of Man
Be rooted out if Ioue should doe still what he can
But thee faire Titans child I rather weene
Through some vaine errour or inducement light
To see that mortall eyes haue neuer seene
Or through ensample of thy sisters might
Bellona whose great glory thou doost spight
Since thou hast seene her dreadfull power belowe
Mongst wretched men dismaide with her affright
To bandie Crownes and Kingdomes to bestowe
And sure thy worth no lesse then hers doth seem to showe
But wote thou this thou hardy Titanesse
That not the worth of any liuing wight
May challenge ought in Heauens interesse
Much lesse the Title of old Titans Right
For we by Conquest of our soueraine might
And by eternall doome of Fates decree
Haue wonne the Empire of the Heauens bright
Which to our selues we hold and to whom wee
Shall worthy deeme partakers of our blisse to bee
Then ceasse thy idle claime thou foolish gerle
And seeke by grace and goodnesse to obtaine
That place from which by folly Titan fell
There-to thou maist perhaps if so thou faine
Haue Ioue thy gratious Lord and Soueraigne
So hauing said she thus to him replide
Ceasse Saturnes sonne to seeke by proffers vaine
Of idle hopes t'allure mee to thy side
For to betray my Right before I haue it tride
But thee o Ioue no equall Iudge I deeme
Of my desert or of my dewfull Right
That in thine owne behalfe maist partiall seeme
But to the highest him that is behight
Father of Gods and men by equall might
To weet the God of Nature I appeale
There-at Ioue wexed wroth and in his spright
Did inly grudge yet did it well conceale
And bade Dan Phoebus Scribe her Appellation seale
Eftsoones the time and place appointed were
Where all both heauenly Powers earthly wights
Before great Natures presence should appeare
For triall of their Titles and best Rights
That was to weet vpon the highest hights
Of Arlo-hill Who knowes not Arlo-hill
That is the highest head in all mens sights
Of my old father Mole whom Shepheards quill
Renowmed hath with hymnes fit for a rurall skill
And were it not ill fitting for this file
To sing of hilles woods mongst warres Knights
I would abate the sternenesse of my stile
Mongst these sterne stounds to mingle soft delights
And tell how Arlo through Dianaes spights
Beeing of old the best and fairest Hill
That was in all this holy-Islands hights
Was made the most vnpleasant and most ill
Meane while o Clio lend Calliope thy quill
Whylome when IRELAND florished in fame
Of wealths and goodnesse far aboue the rest
Of all that beare the British Islands name
The Gods then vs'd for pleasure and for rest
Oft to resort there-to when seem'd them best
But none of all there-in more pleasure found
Then Cynthia that is soueraine Queene profest
Of woods and forrests which therein abound
Sprinkled with wholsom waters more then most on ground
But mongst them all as fittest for her game
Either for chace of beasts with hound or boawe
Or for to shroude in shade from Phoebus flame
Or bathe in fountaines that doe freshly flowe
Or from high hilles or from the dales belowe
She chose this Arlo where shee did resort
With all her Nymphes enranged on a rowe
With whom the woody Gods did oft consort
For with the Nymphes the Satyres loue to play sport
Amongst the which there was a Nymph that hight
Molanna daughter of old father Mole
And sister vnto Mulla faire and bright
Vnto whose bed false Bregog whylome stole
That Shepheard Colin dearely did condole
And made her lucklesse loues well knowne to be
But this Molanna were she not so shole
Were no lesse faire and beautifull then shee
Yet as she is a fairer flood may no man see
For first she springs out of two marble Rocks
On which a groue of Oakes high mounted growes
That as a girlond seemes to deck the locks
Of som faire Bride brought forth with pompous showes
Out of her bowre that many flowers strowes
So through the flowry Dales she tumbling downe
Through many woods and shady coverts flowes
That on each side her siluer channell crowne
Till to the Plaine she come whose Valleyes shee doth drowne
In her sweet streames Diana vsed oft
After her sweatie chace and toilesome play
To bathe her selfe and after on the soft
And downy grasse her dainty limbes to lay
In couert shade where none behold her may
For much she hated sight of liuing eye
Foolish God Faunus though full many a day
He saw her clad yet longed foolishly
To see her naked mongst her Nymphes in priuity
No way he found to compasse his desire
But to corrupt Molanna this her maid
Her to discouer for some secret hire
So her with flattering words he first assaid
And after pleasing gifts for her purvaid
Queene-apples and red Cherries from the tree
with which he her allured and betraid
To tell what time he might her Lady see
When she her selfe did bathe that he might secret bee
There-to hee promist if shee would him pleasure
With this small boone to quit her with a better
To weet that where-as shee had out of measure
Long lov'd the Fanchin who by nought did set her
That he would vndertake for this to get her
To be his Loue and of him liked well
Besides all which he vow'd to be her debter
For many moe good turnes then he would tell
The least of which this little pleasure should excell
The simple maid did yield to him anone
And eft him placed where he close might view
That neuer any saw saue onely one
who for his hire to so foole-hardy dew
Was of his hounds devour'd in Hunters hew
Tho as her manner was on sunny day
Diana with her Nymphes about her drew
To this sweet spring where doffing her array
She bath'  her louely limbes for Ioue a likely pray
There Faunus saw that pleased much his eye
And made his hart to tickle in his brest
That for great ioy of some-what he did spy
He could him not containe in silent rest
But breaking forth in laughter loud profest
His foolish thought O foolish Faune indeed
That couldst not hold thy selfe so hidden blest
But wouldest needs thine owne conceit areed
Babblers vnworthy been of so diuine a meed
The Goddesse all abashed with that noise
In haste forth started from the guilty brooke
And running straight where-as she heard his voice
Enclos'd the bush about and there him tooke
Like darred Larke not daring vp to looke
On her whose sight before so much he sought
Thence forth they drew him by the hornes shooke
Nigh all to peeces that they left him nought
And then into the open light they forth him brought
Like as an huswife that with busie care
Thinks of her Dairie to make wondrous gaine
Finding where-as some wicked beast vnware
That breakes into her Dayr'house there doth draine
Her creaming pannes and frustrate all her paine
Hath in some snare or gin set close behind
Entrapped him and caught into her traine
Then thinkes what punishment were best assign'd
And thousand deathes deuiseth in her vengefull mind
So did Diana and her maydens all
Vse silly Faunus now within their baile
They mocke and scorne him and him foule miscall
Some by the nose him pluckt some by the taile
And by his goatish beard some did him haile
Yet he poore soule with patience all did beare
For nought against their wils might countervaile
Ne ought he said what euer he did heare
But hanging downe his head did like a Mome appeare
At length when they had flouted him their fill
They gan to cast what penaunce him to giue
Some would haue gelt him but that same would spill
The Wood-gods breed which must for euer liue
Others would through the riuer him haue driue
And ducked deepe but that seem'd penaunce light
But most agreed and did this sentence giue
Him in Deares skin to clad in that plight
To hunt him with their hounds him selfe saue how hee might
But Cynthia selfe more angry then the rest
Thought not enough to punish him in sport
And of her shame to make a gamesome iest
But gan examine him in straighter sort
Which of her Nymphes or other close consort
Him thither brought and her to him betraid
He much affeard to her confessed short
That 'twas Molanna which her so bewraid
Then all attonce their hands vpon Molanna laid
But him according as they had decreed
With a Deeres-skin they couered and then chast
With all their hounds that after him did speed
But he more speedy from them fled more fast
Then any Deere so sore him dread aghast
They after follow'd all with shrill out-cry
Shouting as they the heauens would haue brast
That all the woods and dales where he did flie
Did ring againe and loud reeccho to the skie
So they him follow'd till they weary were
When back returning to Molann' againe
They by commaund'ment of Diana there
Her whelm'd with stones Yet Faunus for her paine
Of her beloued Fanchin did obtaine
That her he would receiue vnto his bed
So now her waues passe through a pleasant Plaine
Till with the Fanchin she her selfe doe wed
And both combin'd themselues in one faire riuer spred
Nath'  Diana full of indignation
Thence-forth abandond her delicious brooke
In whose sweet streame before that bad occasion
So much delight to bathe her limbes she tooke
Ne onely her but also quite forsooke
All those faire forrests about Arlo hid
And all that Mountaine which doth over-looke
The richest champian that may else be rid
And the faire Shure in which are thousand Salmons bred
Them all and all that she so deare did way
Thence-forth she left and parting from the place
There-on an heauy haplesse curse did lay
To weet that Wolues where she was wont to space
Should harbour'd be and all those Woods deface
And Thieues should rob and spoile that Coast around
Since which those Woods and all that goodly Chase
Doth to this day with Wolues and Thieues abound
Which too-too true that lands in-dwellers since haue found
AH whither doost thou now thou greater Muse
Me from these woods pleasing forrests bring
And my fraile spirit that dooth oft refuse
This too high flight vnfit for her weake wing
Lift vp aloft to tell of heauens King
Thy soueraine Sire his fortunate successe
And victory in bigger noates to sing
Which he obtain'd against that Titanesse
That him of heauens Empire sought to dispossesse
Yet sith I needs must follow thy behest
Doe thou my weaker wit with skill inspire
Fit for this turne and in my sable brest
Kindle fresh sparks of that immortall fire
Which learned minds inflameth with desire
Of heauenly things for who but thou alone
That art yborne of heauen and heauenly Sire
Can tell things doen in heauen so long ygone
So farre past memory of man that may be knowne
Now at the time that was before agreed
The Gods assembled all on Arlo hill
As well those that are sprung of heauenly seed
As those that all the other world doe fill
And rule both sea and land vnto their will
Onely th'  Powers might not appeare
Aswell for horror of their count'naunce ill
As for th'  fiends which they did feare
Yet Pluto and Proserpina were present there
And thither also came all other creatures
What-euer life or motion doe retaine
According to their sundry kinds of features
That Arlo scarsly could them all containe
So full they filled euery hill and Plaine
And had not Natures Sergeant that is Order
Them well disposed by his busie paine
And raunged farre abroad in euery border
They would haue caused much confusion and disorder
Then forth issewed great goddesse great dame Nature
With goodly port and gracious Maiesty
Being far greater and more tall of stature
Then any of the gods or Powers on hie
Yet certes by her face and physnomy
Whether she man or woman inly were
That could not any creature well descry
For with a veile that wimpled euery where
Her head and face was hid that mote to none appeare
That some doe say was so by skill deuized
To hide the terror of her vncouth hew
From mortall eyes that should be sore agrized
For that her face did like a Lion shew
That eye of wight could not indure to view
But others tell that it so beautious was
And round about such beames of splendor threw
That it the Sunne a thousand times did pass
Ne could be seene but like an image in a glass
That well may seemen true for well I weene
That this same day when she on Arlo sat
Her garment was so bright and wondrous sheene
That my fraile wit cannot deuize to what
It to compare nor finde like stuffe to that
As those three sacred Saints though else most wise
Yet on mount Thabor quite their wits forgat
When they their glorious Lord in strange disguise
Transfigur'd sawe his garments so did daze their eyes
In a fayre Plaine vpon an equall Hill
She placed was in a pauilion
Not such as Craftes-men by their idle skill
Are wont for Princes states to fashion
But th'  her self of her owne motion
Out of her fruitfull bosome made to growe
Most dainty trees that shooting vp anon
Did seeme to bow their bloosming heads full lowe
For homage vnto her and like a throne did shew
So hard it is for any liuing wight
All her array and vestiments to tell
That old Dan Geffrey in whose gentle spright
The pure well head of Poesie did dwell
In his Foules parley durst not with it mel
But it transferd to Alane who he thought
Had in his Plaint of kindes describ'd it well
Which who will read set forth so as it ought
Go seek he out that Alane where he may be sought
And all the earth far vnderneath her feete
Was dight with flowres that voluntary grew
Out of the ground and sent forth odours sweet
Tenne thousand mores of sundry sent and hew
That might delight the smell or please the view
The which the Nymphes from all the brooks thereby
Had gathered which they at her foot-stoole threw
That richer seem'd then any tapestry
That Princes bowres adorne with painted imagery
And Mole himselfe to honour her the more
Did deck himself in freshest faire attire
And his high head that seemeth alwaies hore
With hardned frosts of former winters ire
He with an Oaken girlond now did tire
As if the loue of some new Nymph late seene
Had in him kindled youthfull fresh desire
And made him change his gray attire to greene
Ah gentle Mole such ioyance hath thee well beseene
Was neuer so great ioyance since the day
That all the gods whylome assembled were
On Haemus hill in their diuine array
To celebrate the solemne bridall cheare
Twixt Peleus and dame Thetis pointed there
Where Phoebus self that god of Poets hight
They say did sing the spousall hymne full cleere
That all the gods were rauisht with delight
Of his celestiall song Musicks wondrous might
This great Grandmother of all creatures bred
Great Nature euer young yet full of eld
Still moouing yet vnmoued from her sted
Vnseene of any yet of all beheld
Thus sitting in her throne as I haue teld
Before her came dame Mutabilitie
And being lowe before her presence feld
With meek obaysance and humilitie
Thus gan her plaintif Plea with words to amplifie
To thee o greatest goddesse onely great
An humble suppliant loe I lowely fly
Seeking for Right which I of thee entreat
Who Right to all dost deale indifferently
Damning all Wrong and tortious Iniurie
Which any of thy creatures doe to other
Oppressing them with power vnequally
Sith of them all thou art the equall mother
And knittest each to each as brother vnto brother
To thee therefore of this same Ioue I plaine
And of his fellow gods that faine to be
That challenge to themselues the whole worlds raign
Of which the greatest part is due to me
And heauen it selfe by heritage in Fee
For heauen and earth I both alike do deeme
Sith heauen and earth are both alike to thee
And gods no more then men thou doest esteeme
For euen the gods to thee as men to gods do seeme
Then weigh o soueraigne goddesse by what right
These gods do claime the worlds whole souerainty
And that is onely dew vnto thy might
Arrogate to themselues ambitiously
As for the gods owne principality
Which Ioue vsurpes vniustly that to be
My heritage Ioue self cannot deny
From my great Grandsire Titan vnto mee
Deriv'd by dew descent as is well knowen to thee
Yet mauger Ioue and all his gods beside
I doe possesse the worlds most regiment
As if ye please it into parts diuide
And euery parts inholders to conuent
Shall to your eyes appeare incontinent
And first the Earth great mother of vs all
That only seems vnmov'd and permanent
And vnto Mutability not thrall
Yet is she chang'd in part and eeke in generall
For all that from her springs and is ybredde
How-euer fayre it flourish for a time
Yet see we soone decay and being dead
To turne again vnto their earthly slime
Yet out of their decay and mortall crime
We daily see new creatures to arize
And of their Winter spring another Prime
Vnlike in forme and chang'd by strange disguise
So turne they still about and change in restlesse wise
As for her tenants that is man and beasts
The beasts we daily see massacred dy
As thralls and vassalls vnto mens beheasts
And men themselues doe change continually
From youth to eld from wealth to pouerty
From good to bad from bad to worst of all
Ne doe their bodies only flit and fly
But eeke their minds which they immortall call
Still change and vary thoughts as new occasions fall
Ne is the water in more constant case
Whether those same on high or these belowe
For th'  moueth stil from place to place
And euery Riuer still doth ebbe and flowe
Ne any Lake that seems most still and slowe
Ne Poole so small that can his smoothnesse holde
When any winde doth vnder heauen blowe
With which the clouds are also tost and roll'd
Now like great Hills streight like sluces them vnfold
So likewise are all watry liuing wights
Still tost and turned with continuall change
Neuer abyding in their stedfast plights
The fish still floting doe at randon range
And neuer rest but euermore exchange
Their dwelling places as the streames them carrie
Ne haue the watry foules a certaine grange
Wherein to rest ne in one stead do tarry
But flitting still doe flie and still their places vary
Next is the Ayre which who feeles not by sense
For of all sense it is the middle meane
To flit still and with subtill influence
Of his thin spirit all creatures to maintaine
In state of life O weake life that does leane
On thing so tickle as th'  ayre
Which euery howre is chang'd and altred cleane
With euery blast that bloweth fowle or faire
The faire doth it prolong the fowle doth it impaire
Therein the changes infinite beholde
Which to her creatures euery minute chaunce
Now boyling hot streight friezing deadly cold
Now faire sun-shine that makes all skip and daunce
Streight bitter storms and balefull countenance
That makes them all to shiuer and to shake
Rayne hayle and snowe do pay them sad penance
And dreadfull thunder-claps that make them quake
With flames flashing lights that thousand changes make
Last is the fire which though it liue for euer
Ne can be quenched quite yet euery day
Wee see his parts so soone as they do seuer
To lose their heat and shortly to decay
So makes himself his owne consuming pray
Ne any liuing creatures doth he breed
But all that are of others bredd doth slay
And with their death his cruell life dooth feed
Nought leauing but their barren ashes without seede
Thus all these fower the which the ground-work bee
Of all the world and of all liuing wights
To thousand sorts of Change we subiect see
Yet are they chang'd by other wondrous slights
Into themselues and lose their natiue mights
The Fire to Aire and th'  to Water sheere
And Water into Earth yet Water fights
With Fire and Aire with Earth approaching neere
Yet all are in one body and as one appeare
So in them all raignes Mutabilitie
How-euer these that Gods themselues do call
Of them doe claime the rule and souerainty
As Vesta of the fire aethereall
Vulcan of this with vs so vsuall
Ops of the earth and Iuno of the Ayre
Neptune of Seas and Nymphes of Riuers all
For all those Riuers to me subiect are
And all the rest which they vsurp be all my share
Which to approuen true as I haue told
Vouchsafe o goddesse to thy presence call
The rest which doe the world in being hold
As times and seasons of the yeare that fall
Of all the which demand in generall
Or iudge thy selfe by verdit of thine eye
Whether to me they are not subiect all
Nature did yeeld thereto and by-and-by
Bade Order call them all before her Maiesty
So forth issew'd the Seasons of the yeare
First lusty Spring all dight in leaues of flowres
That freshly budded and new bloosmes did beare
In which a thousand birds had built their bowres
That sweetly sung to call forth Paramours
And in his hand a iauelin he did beare
And on his head as fit for warlike stoures
A guilt engrauen morion he did weare
That as some did him loue so others did him feare
Then came the iolly Sommer being dight
In a thin silken cassock coloured greene
That was vnlyned all to be more light
And on his head a girlond well beseene
He wore from which as he had chauffed been
The sweat did drop and in his hand he bore
A boawe and shaftes as he in forrest greene
Had hunted late the Libbard or the Bore
And now would bathe his limbes with labor heated sore
Then came the Autumne all in yellow clad
As though he ioyed in his plentious store
Laden with fruits that made him laugh full glad
That he had banisht hunger which to-fore
Had by the belly oft him pinched sore
Vpon his head a wreath that was enrold
With eares of corne of euery sort he bore
And in his hand a sickle he did holde
To reape the ripened fruits the which the earth had yold
Lastly came Winter cloathed all in frize
Chattering his teeth for cold that did him chill
Whil'st on his hoary beard his breath did freese
And the dull drops that from his purpled bill
As from a limbeck did adown distill
In his right hand a tipped staffe he held
With which his feeble steps he stayed still
For he was faint with cold and weak with eld
That scarse his loosed limbes he hable was to weld
These marching softly thus in order went
And after them the Monthes all riding came
First sturdy March with brows full sternly bent
And armed strongly rode vpon a Ram
The same which ouer Hellespontus swam
Yet in his hand a spade he also hent
And in a bag all sorts of seeds ysame
Which on the earth he strowed as he went
And fild her womb with fruitfull hope of nourishment
Next came fresh Aprill full of lustyhed
And wanton as a Kid whose horne new buds
Vpon a Bull he rode the same which led
Europa floting through th'  fluds
His hornes were gilden all with golden studs
And garnished with garlonds goodly dight
Of all the fairest flowres and freshest buds
Which th'  brings forth and wet he seem'd in sight
With waues through which he waded for his loues delight
Then came faire May the fayrest mayd on ground
Deckt all with dainties of her seasons pryde
And throwing flowres out of her lap around
Vpon two brethrens shoulders she did ride
The twinnes of Leda which on eyther side
Supported her like to their soueraine Queene
Lord how all creatures laught when her they spide
And leapt and daunc't as they had rauisht beene
And Cupid selfe about her fluttred all in greene
And after her came iolly Iune arrayd
All in greene leaues as he a Player were
Yet in his time he wrought as well as playd
That by his plough-yrons mote right well appeare
Vpon a Crab he rode that him did beare
With crooked crawling steps an vncouth pase
And backward yode as Bargemen wont to fare
Bending their force contrary to their face
Like that vngracious crew which faines demurest grace
Then came hot Iuly boyling like to fire
That all his garments he had cast away
Vpon a Lyon raging yet with ire
He boldly rode and made him to obay
It was the beast that whylome did forray
The Nemaean forrest till th' 
Him slew and with his hide did him array
Behinde his back a sithe and by his side
Vnder his belt he bore a sickle circling wide
The sixt was August being rich arrayd
In garment all of gold downe to the ground
Yet rode he not but led a louely Mayd
Forth by the lilly hand the which was cround
With eares of corne and full her hand was found
That was the righteous Virgin which of old
Liv'd here on earth and plenty made abound
But after Wrong was lov'd and Iustice solde
She left th'  world and was to heauen extold
Next him September marched eeke on foote
Yet was he heauy laden with the spoyle
Of haruests riches which he made his boot
And him enricht with bounty of the soyle
In his one hand as fit for haruests toyle
He held a knife-hook and in th'  hand
A paire of waights with which he did assoyle
Both more and lesse where it in doubt did stand
And equall gaue to each as Iustice duly scann'd
Then came October full of merry glee
For yet his noule was totty of the must
Which he was treading in the wine-fats see
And of the ioyous oyle whose gentle gust
Made him so frollick and so full of lust
Vpon a dreadfull Scorpion he did ride
The same which by Dianaes doom vniust
Slew great Orion and eeke by his side
He had his ploughing share and coulter ready tyde
Next was Nouember he full grosse and fat
As fed with lard and that right well might seeme
For he had been a fatting hogs of late
That yet his browes with sweat did reek and steem
And yet the season was full sharp and breem
In planting eeke he took no small delight
Whereon he rode not easie was to deeme
For it a dreadfull Centaure was in sight
The seed of Saturne and faire Nais Chiron hight
And after him came next the chill December
Yet he through merry feasting which he made
And great bonfires did not the cold remember
His Sauiours birth his mind so much did glad
Vpon a shaggy-bearded Goat he rode
The same wherewith Dan Ioue in tender yeares
They say was nourisht by th'  mayd
And in his hand a broad deepe boawle he beares
Of which he freely drinks an health to all his peeres
Then came old Ianuary wrapped well
In many weeds to keep the cold away
Yet did he quake and quiuer like to quell
And blowe his nayles to warme them if he may
For they were numbd with holding all the day
An hatchet keene with which he felled wood
And from the trees did lop the needlesse spray
Vpon an huge great Earth-pot steane he stood
From whose wide mouth there flowed forth the Romane floud
And lastly came cold February sitting
In an old wagon for he could not ride
Drawne of two fishes for the season fitting
Which through the flood before did softly slyde
And swim away yet had he by his side
His plough and harnesse fit to till the ground
And tooles to prune the trees before the pride
Of hasting Prime did make them burgein round
So past the twelue Months forth their dew places found
And after these there came the Day and Night
Riding together both with equall pace
Th'one on a Palfrey blacke the other white
But Night had couered her vncomely face
With a blacke veile and held in hand a mace
On top whereof the moon and stars were pight
And sleep and darknesse round about did trace
But Day did beare vpon his scepters hight
The goodly Sun encompast all with beames bright
Then came the Howres faire daughters of high Ioue
And timely Night the which were all endewed
With wondrous beauty fit to kindle loue
But they were Virgins all and loue eschewed
That might forslack the charge to them fore-shewed
By mighty Ioue who did them Porters make
Of heauens gate whence all the gods issued
Which they did dayly watch and nightly wake
By euen turnes ne euer did their charge forsake
And after all came Life and lastly Death
Death with most grim and griesly visage seene
Yet is he nought but parting of the breath
Ne ought to see but like a shade to weene
Vnbodied vnsoul'd vnheard vnseene
But Life was like a faire young lusty boy
Such as they faine Dan Cupid to haue beene
Full of delightfull health and liuely ioy
Deckt all with flowres and wings of gold fit to employ
When these were past thus gan the Titanesse
Lo mighty mother now be iudge and say
Whether in all thy creatures more or lesse
CHANGE doth not raign beare the greatest sway
For who sees not that Time on all doth pray
But Times do change and moue continually
So nothing here long standeth in one stay
Wherefore this lower world who can deny
But to be subiect still to Mutabilitie
Then thus gan Ioue Right true it is that these
And all things else that vnder heauen dwell
Are chaung'd of Time who doth them all disseise
Of being But who is it to me tell
That Time himselfe doth moue and still compell
To keepe his course Is not that namely wee
Which poure that vertue from our heauenly cell
That moues them all and makes them changed be
So them we gods doe rule and in them also thee
To whom thus Mutability The things
Which we see not how they are mov'd and swayd
Ye may attribute to your selues as Kings
And say they by your secret powre are made
But what we see not who shall vs perswade
But were they so as ye them faine to be
Mov'd by your might and ordred by your ayde
Yet what if I can proue that euen yee
Your selues are likewise chang'd and subiect vnto mee
And first concerning her that is the first
Euen you faire Cynthia whom so much ye make
Ioues dearest darling she was bred and nurst
On Cynthus hill whence she her name did take
Then is she mortall borne how-so ye crake
Besides her face and countenance euery day
We changed see and sundry forms partake
Now hornd now round now bright now brown gray
So that as changefull as the Moone men vse to say
Next Mercury who though he lesse appeare
To change his hew and alwayes seeme as one
Yet he his course doth altar euery yeare
And is of late far out of order gone
So Venus eeke that goodly Paragone
Though faire all night yet is she darke all day
And Phoebus self who lightsome is alone
Yet is he oft eclipsed by the way
And fills the darkned world with terror and dismay
Now Mars that valiant man is changed most
For he some times so far runs out of square
That he his way doth seem quite to haue lost
And cleane without his vsuall sphere to fare
That euen these Star-gazers stonisht are
At sight thereof and damne their lying bookes
So likewise grim Sir Saturne oft doth spare
His sterne aspect and calme his crabbed lookes
So many turning cranks these haue so many crookes
But you Dan Ioue that only constant are
And King of all the rest as ye do clame
Are you not subiect eeke to this misfare
Then let me aske you this withouten blame
Where were ye borne some say in Crete by name
Others in Thebes and others other-where
But wheresoeuer they comment the same
They all consent that ye begotten were
And borne here in this world ne other can appeare
Then are ye mortall borne and thrall to me
Vnlesse the kingdome of the sky yee make
Immortall and vnchangeable to bee
Besides that power and vertue which ye spake
That ye here worke doth many changes take
And your owne natures change for each of you
That vertue haue or this or that to make
Is checkt and changed from his nature trew
By others opposition or obliquid view
Besides the sundry motions of your Spheares
So sundry waies and fashions as clerkes faine
Some in short space and some in longer yeares
What is the same but alteration plaine
Onely the starrie skie doth still remaine
Yet do the Starres and Signes therein still moue
And euen it self is mov'd as wizards saine
But all that moueth doth mutation loue
Therefore both you and them to me I subiect proue
Then since within this wide great Vniuerse
Nothing doth firme and permanent appeare
But all things tost and turned by transuerse
What then should let but I aloft should reare
My Trophee and from all the triumph beare
Now iudge then O thou greatest goddesse trew
According as thy selfe doest see and heare
And vnto me addoom that is my dew
That is the rule of all all being rul'd by you
So hauing ended silence long ensewed
Ne Nature to or fro spake for a space
But with firme eyes affixt the ground still viewed
Meane while all creatures looking in her face
Expecting th'  of this so doubtfull case
Did hang in long suspence what would ensew
To whether side should fall the soueraigne place
At length she looking vp with chearefull view
The silence brake and gaue her doome in speeches few
I well consider all that ye haue sayd
And find that all things stedfastnes doe hate
And changed be yet being rightly wayd
They are not changed from their first estate
But by their change their being doe dilate
And turning to themselues at length againe
Doe worke their owne perfection so by fate
Then ouer them Change doth not rule and raigne
But they raigne ouer change and doe their states maintaine
Cease therefore daughter further to aspire
And thee content thus to be rul'd by me
For thy decay thou seekst by thy desire
But time shall come that all shall changed bee
And from thenceforth none no more change shall see
So was the Titaness put downe and whist
And Ioue confirm'd in his imperiall see
Then was that whole assembly quite dismist
And Natur selfe did vanish whither no man wist
W Hen I bethinke me on that speech whyleare
Of Mutability and well it way
Me seemes that though she all vnworthy were
Of the Heav'ns Rule yet very sooth to say
In all things else she beares the greatest sway
Which makes me loath this state of life so tickle
And loue of things so vaine to cast away
Whose flowring pride so fading and so fickle
Short Time shall soon cut down with his consuming sickle
Then gin I thinke on that which Nature sayd
Of that same time when no more Change shall be
But stedfast rest of all things firmely stayd
Vpon the pillours of Eternity
That is contrayr to Mutabilitie
For all that moueth doth in Change delight
But thence-forth all shall rest eternally
With Him that is the God of Sabbaoth hight
O thou great Sabbaoth God graunt me that Sabaoths sight
But envious brains do nought or light esteem
Such stately steps as they cannot attain 
For whoso reaps renown above the rest
With heaps of hate shall surely be oppressed
Wherefore to write my censure of this book
This Glass of Steel unpartially doth show
Abuses all to such as in it look
From prince to poor from high estate to low
As for the verse who list like trade to try
I fear me much shall hardly reach so high
What could they say to win again my grace  
Forsooth that they had seen my mistress' face
Another time my heart I called to mind  
Thinking that he this woe on me had brought
Because that he to love his force resigned
When of such wars my fancy never thought 
What could he say when I would him have slain  
That he was hers and had forgone my chain
At last when I perceived both eyes and heart
Excuse themselves as guiltless of my ill
I found myself the cause of all my smart
And told myself that I myself would kill 
Yet when I saw myself to you was true
I loved myself because myself loved you
Yet rich in zeal though poor in learning lore
And friendly care obscured in secret breast
And love that envy in thy life suppressed  
Thy dear life done   and death hath doubled more
And I that in thy time and Hving state
Did only praise thy virtues in my thought
As one that seeld the rising sun hath sought
With words and tears now wail thy timeless fate
Drawn was thy race aright from princely line 
Nor less than such by gifts that nature gave  
The common mother that all creatures have  
Doth virtue show and princely lineage shine
A king gave thee thy name a kingly mind  
That God thee gave   who found it now too dear
For this base world and hath resumed it near
To sit in skies and sort with powers divine
Kent thy birth-days and Oxford held thy youth 
The heavens made haste and stayed nor years nor time 
The fruits of age grew ripe in thy first prime 
Thy will thy words thy words the seals of truth
Great gifts and wisdom rare employed thee thence
To treat from kings with those more great than kings 
Such hope men had to lay the highest things
On thy wise youth to be transported hence 
Whence to sharp wars sweet honour did thee call
Thy country love religion and thy friends 
Of worthy men the marks the lives and ends
And her defence for whom we labour all
There didst thou vanquish shame and tedious age
Grief sorrow sickness and base fortune might
Thy rising day saw never woeful night
But passed with praise from off this worldly stage
Back to the camp by thee that day was brought
First thine own death and after thy long fame
Tears to the soldiers the proud Castilian shame 
Virtue expressed and honour truly taught
What hath he lost that such great grace hath won 
Young years for endless years and hope unsure
Of fortune gifts for wealth that still shall dure 
Q happy race with so great praises run 
England doth hold thy limbs that bred the same 
Flanders thy valour where it last was tried 
The camp thy sorrow where thy body died 
Thy friends thy want the world thy virtue fame 
Nations thy wit our minds lay up thy love 
Letters thy learning thy loss years long to come 
In worthy hearts sorrow hath made thy tomb 
Thy soul and spright enrich the heavens above
Thy liberal heart embalmed in grateful tears
Young sighs sweet sighs sage sighs bewail thy fall
Envy her sting and spite hath left her gall 
Malice herself a mourning garment wears
That day their Hannibal died our Scipio fell 
Scipio Cicero and Petrarch of our time 
Whose virtues wounded by my worthless rhyme
Let angels speak and heaven thy praises tell
Was wont to burn and passing by that way
To see that buried dust of living fame
Whose tomb fair Love and fairer Virtue kept
All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen
At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept 
And from thenceforth those graces were not seen
For they this Queen attended in whose stead
Oblivion laid him down on Laura hearse
Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed
And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce 
Where Homer spright did tremble all for grief
And cursed the access of that celestial thief
A gown of grief my body shall attire
And broken hope shall be my strength and stay
And late repentance linked with long desire
Shall be the couch whereon my limbs lay
And at my gates despair shall linger still
To let in death when love and fortune will
My food shall be of care and sorrow made 
My drink nought else but tears fallen from mine eyes 
And for my light in such obscured shade
The flames may serve which from my heart arise
And at my gates despair shall linger still
To let in death when love and fortune will
My lost delights now clean from sight of land
Have left me all alone in unknown ways
My mind to woe my life in fortune hand 
Of all which past the sorrow only stays
As in a country strange without companion
I only wail the wrong of death delays
Whose sweet spring spent whose summer well nigh done 
Of all which past the sorrow only stays 
Whom care forewarns ere age and winter cold
To haste me hence to find my fortune fold
Therefore take heed let fancy never swerve
But unto him that will take leaves and all 
For this be sure the flower once plucked avay
Farewell the rest thy happy days decay 
Many desire but few or none deserve
To cut the corn not subject to the sickle 
Therefore take heed let fancy never swerve
But constant stand for mowers' minds are fickle 
For this be sure the crop being once obtained
Farewell the rest the soil will be disdained
Four kings shall be assembled in this isle
Where they shall keep great tumult for awhile
Many men then shall have an end of crosses
And many likewise shall sustain great losses 
Many that now full joyful are and glad
Shall at that time be sorrowful and sad 
Full many a Christian heart shall quake for fear
The dreadful sound of trump when he shall hear
Dead bones shall then be tumbled up and down
In every city and in every town
By day or night this tumult shall not cease
Until an herald shall proclaim a peace 
An herald strong the like was never born
Whose very beard is flesh and mouth is horn
We should begin by such a parting light
To write the story of all ages past
And end the same before the approaching night
Such is again the labour of my mind
Whose shroud by sorrow woven now to end
Hath seen that ever shining sun declined
So many years that so could not descend
But that the eyes of my mind held her beams
In every part transferred by love swift thought 
Far off or near in waking or in dreams
Imagination strong their lustre brought
Such force her angelic appearance had
To master distance time or cruelty 
Such art to grieve and after to make glad 
Such fear in love such love in majesty
My weary lines her memory embalmed 
My darkest ways her eyes make clear as day
What storms so great but Cynthia beams appeased 
What rage so fierce that love could not allay 
Twelve years entire I wasted in this war 
Twelve years of my most happy younger days 
But I in them and they now wasted are 
 Of all which past the sorrow only stays
So wrote I once and my mishap foretold
My mind still feeling sorrowful success 
Even as before a storm the marble cold
Doth by moist tears tempestuous times express
So felt my heavy mind my harms at hand
Which my vain thought in vain sought to recure 
At middle day my sun seemed under land
When any little cloud did it obscure
And as the icicles in a winter day
Whenas the sun shines with unwonted warm
So did my joys melt into secret tears 
So did my heart dissolve in wasting drops 
And as the season of the year outwears
And heaps of snow from off the mountain tops
 With sudden streams the valleys overflow
So did the time draw on my more despair 
Then floods of sorrow and whole seas of woe
The banks of all my hope did overbear
And drowned my mind in depths of misery 
Sometime I died sometime I was distract
My soul the stage of fancy tragedy 
Then furious madness where true reason lacked
Wrote what it would and scourged mine own conceit
Oh heavy heart who can thee witness bear 
What tongue what pen could thy tormenting treat
But thine own mourning thoughts which present were 
What stranger mind believe the meanest part 
What altered sense conceive the weakest woe
That tare that rent that pierced thy sad heart 
And as a man distract with triple might
Bound in strong chains doth strive and rage in vain
Till tired and breathless he is forced to rest  
Finds by contention but increase of pain
And fiery heat inflamed in swollen breast 
So did my mind in change of passion
From woe to wrath from wrath return to woe
Struggling in vain from love subjection 
Therefore all lifeless and all helpless bound
My fainting spirits sunk and heart appalled
My joys and hopes lay bleeding on the ground
That not long since the highest heaven scaled
I hated life and cursed destiny 
The thoughts of passed times like flames of hell
Kindled afresh within my memory
The many dear achievements that befell
In those prime years and infancy of love
Which to describe were but to die in writing 
Ah those I sought but vainly to remove
And vainly shall by which I perish living
And though strong reason hold before mine eyes
The images and forms of worlds past
Teaching the cause why all those flames that rise
From forms external can no longer last
Than that those seeming beauties hold in prime
Love ground his essence and his empery
All slaves to age and vassals unto time
Of which repentance writes the tragedy  
But this my heart desire could not conceive
Whose love outflew the fastest flying time
A beauty that can easily deceive
The arrest of years and creeping age outclimb
A spring of beauties which time ripeth not  
Time that but works on frail mortality 
A sweetness which woe wrongs outwipeth not
Whom love hath chose for his divinity 
A vestal fire that burns but never wasteth
That loseth nought by giving light to all
That endless shines each where and endless lasteth
Blossoms of pride that can nor fade nor fall 
These were those marvellous perfections
The parents of my sorrow and my envy
Most deathful and most violent infections 
These be the tyrants that in fetters tie
Their wounded vassals yet nor kill nor cure
But glory in their lasting misery  
That as her beauties would our woes should dure  
These be the effects of powerful empery
Yet have these wounders want which want compassion 
Yet hath her mind some marks of human race 
Yet will she be a woman for a fashion
So doth she please her virtues to deface
And like as that immortal power doth seat
An element of waters to allay
- The fiery sunbeams that on earth do beat
And temper by cold night the heat of day
So hath perfection which begat her mind
Added thereto a change of fantasy
And left her the affections of her kind
Yet free from every evil but cruelty
But leave her praise speak thou of nought but woe 
Write on the tale that sorrow bids thee tell 
Strive to forget and care no more to know
Thy cares are known by knowing those too well
Describe her now as she appears to thee 
Not as she did appear in days fordone 
In love those things that were no more may be
For fancy seldom ends where it begun
And as a stream by strong hand bounded in
From nature course where it did sometime run
By some small rent or loose part doth begin
To find escape till it a way hath won 
Doth then all unawares in sunder tear
The forced bounds and raging run at large
In the ancient channels as they wonted were 
Such is of women love the careful charge  
Held and maintained with multitude of woes 
Of long erections such the sudden fall 
One hour diverts one instant overthrows
For which our lives for which our fortune thrall
So many years those joys have dearly bought 
Of which when our fond hopes do most assure
All is dissolved our labours come to nought 
Nor any mark thereof there doth endure 
No more than when small drops of rain do fall
Upon the parched ground by heat updried 
No cooling moisture is perceived at all
Nor any show or sign of wet doth bide
But as the fields clothed with leaves and flowers
The banks of roses smelling precious sweet
Have but their beauty date and timely hours
And then defaced by winter cold and sleet
So far as neither fruit nor form of flower
Stays for a witness what such branches bare
But as time gave time did again devour
And change our rising joy to falling care 
So of affection which our youth presented 
When she that from the sun reaves power and light
Did but decline her beams as discontented
Converting sweetest days to saddest night
All droops all dies all trodden under dust
The person place and passages forgotten 
The hardest steel eaten with softest rust
The firm and solid tree both rent and rotten
Those thoughts so full of pleasure and content
That in our absence were affection food
Are razed out and from the fancy rent 
In highest grace and heart dear care that stood
Are cast for prey to hatred and to scorn  
Our dearest treasures and our heart true joys 
 The tokens hung on breast and kindly worn
Are now elsewhere disposed or held for toys
And those which then our jealousy removed
And others for our sakes then valued dear
The one forgot the rest are dear beloved
When all of ours doth strange or vild appear
Those streams seem standing puddles which before
We saw our beauties in so were they clear 
Belphoebe course is now observed no more 
That fair resemblance weareth out of date 
Our ocean seas are but tempestuous waves
And all things base that blessed were of late
And as a field wherein the stubble stands
Of harvest past the ploughman eye offends 
He tills again or tears them up with hands
And throws to fire as foiled and fruitless ends
And takes delight another seed to sow 
So doth the mind root up all wonted thought
And scorns the care of our remaining woes 
The sorrows which themselves for us have wrought
Are burnt to cinders by new kindled fires 
The ashes are dispersed into the air 
The sighs the groans of all our past desires
Are clean outworn as things that never were
With youth is dead the hope of love return
Who looks not back to hear our after-cries 
Where he is not he laughs at those that mourn 
Whence he is gone he scorns the mind that dies
When he is absent he believes no words 
When reason speaks he careless stops his ears 
Whom he hath left he never grace affords
But bathes his wings in our lamenting tears
Unlasting passion soon outworn conceit
Whereon I built and on so dureless trust 
My mind had wounds I dare not say deceit
' Were I resolved her promise was not just
Sorrow was my revenge and woe my hate 
I powerless was to alter my desire 
My love is not of time or bound to date 
My heart internal heat and living fire
Would not or could be quenched with sudden showers 
My bound respect was not confined to days 
My vowed faith not set to ended hours 
I love the bearing and not bearing sprays
Which now to others do their sweetness send 
The incarnate snow-driven white and purest azure 
Who from high heaven doth on their fields descend
Filling their barns with grain and towers with treasure
Erring or never erring such is love
As while it lasteth scorns the account of those
Seeking but self-contentment to improve
And hides if any be his inward woes
And will not know while he knows his own passion
The often and unjust perseverance
 In deeds of love and state and every action
From that first day and yearof their joy entrance
But I unblessed and ill-born creature
That did embrace the dust her body bearing
That loved her both by fancy and by nature
That drew even with the milk in my first sucking
Affection from the parent breast that bare me
Have found her as a stranger so severe
Improving my mishap in each degree 
But love was gone so would I my life were 
A queen she was to me   no more Belphoebe 
A lion then   no more a milk-white dove 
A prisoner in her breast I could not be  
She did untie the gentle chains of love
Love was no more the love of hiding
All trespass and mischance for her own glory 
It had been such it was still for the elect 
But I must be the example in love story 
This was of all forepast the sad effect
But thou my weary soul and heav- thought
Made by her love a burthen to my being
Dost know my error never was forethought
Or ever could proceed from sense of loving
Of other cause if then it had proceeding
I leave the excuse sith judgment hath been given 
The limbs divided sundered and ableeding
Cannot complain the sentence was uneven
This did that nature wonder virtue choice
The only paragon of time begetting
Divine in words angelical in voice
That spring of joys that flower of love own setting
The idea remaining of those golden ages
That beauty braving heavens and earth em- balming
Which after worthless worlds but play on stages
Such didst thou her long since describe yet sighing
That thy unable spirit could not find aught
In heaven beauties or in earth delight
For likeness fit to satisfy thy thought 
But what hath it availed thee so to write 
She cares not for thy praise who knows not theirs 
It now an idle labour and a tale
Told out of time that dulls the hearer ears 
A merchandize whereof there is no sale
Leave them or lay them up with thy despairs 
She hath resolved and judged thee long ago
Thy lines are now a murmuring to her ears
Like to a falling stream which passing slow
Is wont to nourish sleep and quietness 
So shall thy painful labours be perused
And draw on rest which sometime had regard 
But those her cares thy errors have excused
Thy days fordone have had their day reward 
So her hard heart so her estranged mind
In which above the heavens I once reposed 
So to thy error have her ears inclined
And have forgotten all thy past deserving
Holding in mind but only thine offence 
And only now afiecteth thy depraving
And thinks all vain that pleadeth thy defence
Yet greater fancy beauty never bred 
A more desire the heart-blood never nourished 
Her sweetness an affection never fed
Which more in any age hath ever flourished
The mind and virtue never have begotten
A firmer love since love on earth had power 
A love obscured but cannot be forgotten 
Too great and strong for time jaws to devour 
Containing such a faith as ages wound not
Care wakeful ever of her good estate
Fear dreading loss which sighs and joys not
A memory of the joys her grace begat 
A lasting gratefulness for those comforts past
Of which the cordial sweetness cannot die 
These thoughts knit up by faith shall ever last 
These time assays but never can untie
Whose life once lived in her pearl-like breast
Whose joys were drawn but from her happiness
Whose hearts high pleasure and whose mind's true rest
Proceeded from her fortune blessedness 
Who was intentive wakeful and dismayed
In fears in dreams in feverous jealousy
Who long in silence served and obeyed
With secret heart and hidden loyalty
Which never change to sad adversity
Which never age or nature overthrow
Which never sickness or deformity
Which never wasting care or wearing woe
If subject unto these she could have been  
Which never words or wits malicious
Which never honour bait or world s fame
Achieved by attempts adventurous
Or aught beneath the sun or heavens frame
Can so dissolve dissever or destroy
The essential love of no frail parts compounded
Though of the same now buried be the joy
The -hope the comfort and the sweetness ended
But that the thoughts and memories of thfese
Work a relapse of passion and remain
Of mv sad heart the sorrow-suckmg bees 
The wrongs received the frowns persuade in vain
And though these medicines work desire to end
And are in others the true cure of liking
The salves that heal love wounds and do amend
Consuming woe and slake our hearty sighing
They work not so in thy mind long decease 
External fancy time alone recureth
All whose effects do wear away with ease
Love of delight while such delight endureth 
Stays by the pleasure but no longer stays 
But in my mind so is her love inclosed
And is thereof not only the best part
But into it the essence is disposed
Oh love the more my woe to it thou art
Even as the moisture in each plant that grows 
Even as the sun unto the frozen ground 
Even as the sweetness to the incarnate rose 
Even as the centre in each perfect round
As water to the fish to men as air
As heat to fire as light unto the sun 
Oh love it is but vain to say thou were 
Ages and times cannot thy power outrun
Thou art the soul of that unhappy mind
Which being by nature made an idle thought
Began even then to take immortal kind
When first her virtues in thy spirits wrought
From thee therefore that mover cannot move
Because it is become thy cause of being 
Whatever error may obscure that love
Whatever frail effect in mortal living
Whatever passion from distempered heart
What absence time or injuries effect
What faithless friends or deep dissembled art
Present to feed her most unkind suspect
Yet as the air in deep caves underground
Is strongly drawn when violent heat hath vent
Great clefts therein till moisture do abound
And then the same imprisoned and uppent
Breaks out in earthquakes tearing all asunder 
So in the centre of my cloven heart  
My heart to whom her beauties were such wonder  
Lies the sharp poisoned head of that love dart
Which till all break and all dissolve to dust
Thence drawn it cannot be or therein known 
There mixed with my heart-blood the fretting rust
The better part hath eaten and outgrown
But what of those or these or what of ought
Of that which was or that which is to treat 
What I possess is but the same I sought 
My love was false my labours were deceit
Nor less than such they are esteemed to be 
A fraud bought at the price of many woes 
A guile whereof the profits unto me  
Could it be thought premeditate for those 
Witness those withered leaves left on the tree
The sorrow-worn face the pensive mind 
The external shews what may the internal be 
Cold care hath bitten both the root and rind
But stay my thoughts make end give fortune way 
Harsh is the voice of woe and sorrow sound 
Complaints cure not and tears do but allay
Griefs for a time which after more abound
To seek for moisture in the Arabian sand
Is but a loss of labour and of rest 
The links which time did break of hearty bands
Words cannot knit or wailings make anew
Seek not the sun in clouds when it is set 
On highest mountains where those cedars grew
Against whose banks the troubled ocean beat
And were the marks to find thy hoped port
Into a soil far off themselves remove
On Sestus' shore Leander late resort
Hero hath left no lamp to guide her love
Thou lookest for light in vain and storms arise 
She sleeps thy death that erst thy danger sighed
To God I leave it who first gave it me
And I her gave and she returned again
As it was hers so let His mercies be
Of my last comforts the essential mean
But be it so or not the effects are past
Her love hath end my woe must ever last
My days' delights my spring-time joys fordone
Which in the dawn and rising sun of youth
Had their creation and were first begun
Do in the evening and the winter sad
Present my mind which takes my time account
The grief remaining of the joy it had
My times that then ran o'er themselves in these
And now run out in other happiness
Bring unto those new joys and new-born days
So could she not if she were not the sun
Which sees the birth and burial of all else
And holds that power with which she first begun
Leaving each withered body to be torn
By fortune and by times tempestuous
Which by her virtue once fair fruit have born 
Knowing she can renew and can create
Green from the ground and flowers even out of stone 
By virtue lasting over time and date
Leaving us only woe which like the moss
Having compassion of unburied bones
Cleaves to mischance and unrepaired loss
Lo I the man whose Muse whilome did maske
As time her taught in lowly Shepheards weeds
Am now enforst a far unfitter taske
For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds
Whose prayses having slept in silence long
Me all too meane the sacred Muse areeds
To blazon broade emongst her learned throng
Fierce warres and faithfull loves shall moralize my song
Helpe then O holy Virgin chiefe of nine
Thy weaker Novice to performe thy will
Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne
The antique rolles which there lye hidden still
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long
Sought through the world and suffered so much ill
That I must rue his undeserved wrong
O helpe thou my weake wit and sharpen my dull tong
And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove
Faire Venus sonne that with thy cruell dart
At that good knight so cunningly didst rove
That glorious fire it kindled in his hart
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart
And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde
Come both and with you bring triumphant Mart
In loves and gentle jollities arrayd
After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd
And with them eke O Goddesse heavenly bright
Mirrour of grace and Majestie divine
Great Lady of the greatest Isle whose light
Like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne
And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile
To thinke of that true glorious type of thine
The argument of mine afflicted stile
The which to heare vouchsafe O dearest dred a-while
A GENTLE Knight was pricking on the plaine
Ycladd in mightie armes and silver shielde
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine
The cruel markes of many'a bloudy fielde
Yet armes till that time did he never wield
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield
Full jolly knight he seemd and faire did sitt
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt
And on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore
And dead as living ever him ador'd
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd
For soveraine hope which in his helpe he had
Right faithfull true he was in deede and word
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad
Yet nothing did he dread but ever was ydrad
Upon a great adventure he was bond
That greatest Gloriana to him gave
That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond
To winne him worship and her grace to have
Which of all earthly things he most did crave
And ever as he rode his hart did earne
To prove his puissance in battell brave
Upon his foe and his new force to learne
Upon his foe a Dragon horrible and stearne
A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside
Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow
Yet she much whiter but the same did hide
Under a vele that wimpled was full low
And over all a blacke stole she did throw
As one that inly mournd so was she sad
And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad
So pure and innocent as that same lambe
She was in life and every vertuous lore
And by descent from Royall lynage came
Of ancient Kings and Queenes that had of yore
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore
And all the world in their subjection held
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore
Forwasted all their land and them expeld
Whom to avenge she had this Knight from far compeld
Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag
That lasie seemd in being ever last
Or wearied with bearing of her bag
Of needments at his backe Thus as they past
The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast
And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine
Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast
That everie wight to shrowd it did constrain
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain
Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand
A shadie grove not far away they spide
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride
Did spred so broad that heavens light did hide
Not perceable with power of any starre
And all within were pathes and alleies wide
With footing worne and leading inward farre
Faire harbour that them seemes so in they entred arre
And foorth they passe with pleasure forward led
Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy
The sayling Pine the Cedar proud and tall
The vine-prop Elme the Poplar never dry
The builder Oake sole king of forrests all
The Aspine good for staves the Cypresse funerall
The Laurell meed of mightie Conquerours
And Poets sage the firre that weepeth still
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours
The Eugh obedient to the benders will
The Birch for shaftes the Sallow for the mill
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound
The warlike Beech the Ash for nothing ill
The fruitfull Olive and the Platane round
The carver Holme the Maple seeldom inward sound
Led with delight they thus beguile the way
Untill the blustring storme is overblowne
When weening to returne whence they did stray
They cannot finde that path which first was showne
But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne
Furthest from end then when they neerest weene
That makes them doubt their wits be not their owne
So many pathes so many turnings seene
That which of them to take in diverse doubt they been
At last resolving forward still to fare
Till that some end they finde or in or out
That path they take that beaten seemd most bare
And like to lead the labyrinth about
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout
At length it brought them to a hollow cave
Amid the thickest woods The Champion stout
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave
And to the Dwarfe awhile his needlesse spere he gave
Be well aware quoth then that Ladie milde
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke
The danger hid the place unknowne and wilde
Breedes dreadfull doubts Oft fire is without smoke
And perill without show therefore your stroke
Sir Knight with-hold till further triall made
Ah Ladie said he shame were to revoke
The forward footing for an hidden shade
Vertue gives her selfe light through darkenesse for to wade
Yea but quoth she the perill of this place
I better wot then you though now too late
To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace
Yet wisedome warnes whilest foot is in the gate
To stay the steppe ere forced to retrate
This is the wandring wood this Errours den
A monster vile whom God and man does hate
Therefore I read beware Fly fly quoth then
The fearefull Dwarfe this is no place for living men
But full of fire and greedy hardiment
The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide
But forth unto the darksome hole he went
And looked in his glistring armor made
A litle glooming light much like a shade
By which he saw the ugly monster plaine
Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide
But th'  halfe did womans shape retaine
Most lothsom filthie foule and full of vile disdaine
And as she lay upon the durtie ground
Her huge long taile her den all overspred
Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound
Pointed with mortall sting Of her there bred
A thousand yong ones which she dayly fed
Sucking upon her poisnous dugs eachone
Of sundry shapes yet all ill favored
Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone
Into her mouth they crept and suddain all were gone
Their dam upstart out of her den effraide
And rushed forth hurling her hideous taile
About her cursed head whose folds displaid
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile
She lookt about and seeing one in mayle
Armed to point sought backe to turne againe
For light she hated as the deadly bale
Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine
Where plain none might her see nor she see any plaine
Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd he lept
As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept
From turning backe and forced her to stay
Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray
And turning fierce her speckled taile advaunst
Threatning her angry sting him to dismay
Who nought aghast his mightie hand enhaunst
The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst
Much daunted with that dint her sence was dazd
Yet kindling rage her selfe she gathered round
And all attonce her beastly body raizd
With doubled forces high above the ground
Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd
Lept fierce upon his shield and her huge traine
All suddenly about his body wound
That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine
His Lady sad to see his sore constraint
Cride out Now now Sir knight shew what ye bee
Add faith unto your force and be not faint
Strangle her else she sure will strangle thee
That when he heard in great perplexitie
His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine
And knitting all his force got one hand free
Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw
A floud of poyson horrible and blacke
Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw
Which stunck so vildly that it forst him slacke
His grasping hold and from her turne him backe
Her vomit full of bookes and papers was
With loathly frogs and toades which eyes did lacke
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has
As when old father Nilus gins to swell
With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale
His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale
But when his later spring gins to avale
Huge heapes of mudd he leaves wherein there breed
Ten thousand kindes of creatures partly male
And partly female of his fruitful seed
Such ugly monstrous shapes elswhere may no man reed
The same so sore annoyed has the knight
That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke
His forces faile ne can no lenger fight
Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke
Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small
Deformed monsters fowle and blacke as inke
With swarming all about his legs did crall
And him encombred sore but could not hurt at all
As gentle Shepheard in sweete even-tide
When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west
High on an hill his flocke to vewen wide
Markes which do byte their hasty supper best
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest
All striving to infixe their feeble stings
That from their noyance he no where can rest
But with his clownish hands their tender wings
He brusheth oft and oft doth mar their murmurings
Thus ill bestedd and fearefull more of shame
Then of the certeine perill he stood in
Halfe furious unto his foe he came
Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win
Or soone to lose before he once would lin
And strooke at her with more then manly force
That from her body full of filthie sin
He raft her hatefull head without remorse
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse
Her scattred brood soone as their Parent deare
They saw so rudely falling to the ground
Groning full deadly all with troublous feare
Gathred themselves about her body round
Weening their wonted entrance to have found
At her wide mouth but being there withstood
They flocked all about her bleeding wound
And sucked up their dying mothers blood
Making her death their life and eke her hurt their good
That detestable sight him much amazde
To see th' unkindly Impes of heaven accurst
Devoure their dam on whom while so he gazd
Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst
And bowels gushing forth well worthy end
Of such as drunke her life the which them nurst
Now needeth him no lenger labour spend
His foes have slaine themselves with whom he should contend
His Ladie seeing all that chaunst from farre
Approcht in hast to greet his victorie
And said Faire knight borne under happy starre
Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye
Well worthie be you of that Armorie
Wherin ye have great glory wonne this day
And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie
Your first adventure many such I pray
And henceforth ever wish that like succeed it may
Then mounted he upon his Steede againe
And with the Lady backward sought to wend
That path he kept which beaten was most plaine
Ne ever would to any by-way bend
But still did follow one unto the end
The which at last out of the wood them brought
So forward on his way with God to frend
He passed forth and new adventure sought
Long way he travelled before he heard of ought
At length they chaunst to meet upon the way
An aged Sire in long blacke weedes yclad
His feete all bare his beard all hoarie gray
And by his belt his booke he hanging had
Sober he seemde and very sagely sad
And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent
Simple in shew and voyde of malice bad
And all the way he prayed as he went
And often knockt his brest as one that did repent
He faire the knight saluted louting low
Who faire him quited as that courteous was
And after asked him if he did know
Of straunge adventures which abroad did pas
Ah my deare Sonne quoth he how should alas
Silly old man that lives in hidden cell
Bidding his beades all day for his trespas
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell
With holy father sits not with such things to mell
But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell
And homebred evil ye desire to heare
Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare
Of such said he I chiefly do inquere
And shall you well reward to shew the place
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare
For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace
That such a cursed creature lives so long a space
Far hence quoth he in wastfull wildernesse
His dwelling is by which no living wight
May ever passe but thorough great distresse
Now sayd the Lady draweth toward night
And well I wote that of your later fight
Ye all forwearied be for what so strong
But wanting rest will also want of might
The Sunne that measures heaven all day long
At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong
Then with the Sunne take Sir your timely rest
And with new day new worke at once begin
Untroubled night they say gives counsell best
Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin
Quoth then that aged man the way to win
Is wisely to advise now day is spent
Therefore with me ye may take up your In
For this same night The knight was well content
So with that godly father to his home they went
A little lowly Hermitage it was
Downe in a dale hard by a forests side
Far from resort of people that did pas
In travell to and froe a little wyde
There was an holy Chappell edifyde
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say
His holy things each morne and eventyde
Thereby a Christall streame did gently play
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway
Arrived there the little house they fill
Ne looke for entertainement where none was
Rest is their feast and all things at their will
The noblest mind the best contentment has
With faire discourse the evening so they pas
For that old man of pleasing wordes had store
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas
He told of Saintes and Popes and evermore
He strowd an Ave-Mary after and before
The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast
And the sad humour loading their eye liddes
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast
Sweet slombring deaw the which to sleepe them biddes
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes
Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes
He to this study goes and there amiddes
His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes
He seekes out mighty charmes to trouble sleepy mindes
Then choosing out few words most horrible
Let none them read thereof did verses frame
With which and other spelles like terrible
He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame
And cursed heaven and spake reprochfull shame
Of highest God the Lord of life and light
A bold bad man that dar'd to call by name
Great Gorgon Prince of darknesse and dead night
At which Cocytus quakes and Styx is put to flight
And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred
Legions of Sprights the which like little flyes
Fluttring about his ever damned hed
Awaite whereto their service he applyes
To aide his friends or fray his enimies
Of those he chose out two the falsest twoo
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes
The one of them he gave a message too
The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo
He making speedy way through spersed ayre
And through the world of waters wide and deepe
To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire
Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe
And low where dawning day doth never peepe
His dwelling is there Tethys his wet bed
Doth ever wash and Cynthia still doth steepe
In silver deaw his ever-drouping hed
Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred
Whose double gates he findeth locked fast
The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory
The other all with silver overcast
And wakeful dogges before them farre do lye
Watching to banish Care their enimy
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe
By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly
And unto Morpheus comes whom drowned deepe
In drowsie fit he findes of nothing he takes keepe
And more to lulle him in his slumber soft
A trickling streame from high rock tumbling downe
And ever-drizling raine upon the loft
Mixt with a murmuring winde much like the sowne
Of swarming Bees did cast him in a swowne
No other noyse nor peoples troublous cryes
As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne
Might there be heard but carelesse Quiet lyes
Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes
The messenger approching to him spake
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine
So sound he slept that nought mought him awake
Then rudely he him thrust and pusht with paine
Whereat he gan to stretch but he againe
Shooke him so hard that forced him to speake
As one then in a dreame whose dryer braine
Is tost with troubled sights and fancies weake
He mumbled soft but would not all his silence breake
The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake
And threatned unto him the dreaded name
Of Hecate whereat he gan to quake
And lifting up his lumpish head with blame
Halfe angry asked him for what he came
Hither quoth he me Archimago sent
He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame
He bids thee to him send for his intent
A fit false dreame that can delude the sleepers sent
The God obayde and calling forth straightway
A diverse dreame out of his prison darke
Delivered it to him and downe did lay
His heavie head devoide of carefull carke
Whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke
He backe returning by the Yvorie dore
Remounted up as light as chearefull Larke
And on his litle winges the dreame he bore
In hast unto his Lord where he him left afore
Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes
Had made a Lady of that other Spright
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes
So lively and so like in all mens sight
That weaker sence it could have ravisht quight
The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight
Her all in white he clad and over it
Cast a black stole most like to seeme for Una fit
Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought
Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly
Where he slept soundly void of evill thought
And with false shewes abuse his fantasy
In sort as he him schooled privily
And that new creature borne without her dew
Full of the makers guile with usage sly
He taught to imitate that Lady trew
Whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew
Thus well instructed to their worke they hast
And coming where the knight in slomber lay
The one upon his hardy head him plast
And made him dreame of loves and lustfull play
That nigh his manly hart did melt away
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy
Then seemed him his Lady by him lay
And to him playnd how that false winged boy
Her chast hart had subdewd to learne Dame Pleasures toy
And she herselfe of beautie soveraigne Queene
Fayre Venus seemde unto his bed to bring
Her whom he waking evermore did weene
To bee the chastest flowre that ay did spring
On earthly braunch the daughter of a king
Now a loose Leman to vile service bound
And eke the Graces seemed all to sing
Hymen Io Hymen dauncing all around
Whilst freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd
In this great passion of unwonted lust
Or wonted feare of doing ought amis
He started up as seeming to mistrust
Some secret ill or hidden foe of his
Lo there before his face his Lady is
Under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke
And as halfe blushing offred him to kis
With gentle blandishment and lovely looke
Most like that virgin true which for her knight him took
All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight
And half enraged at her shamelesse guise
He thought have slaine her in his fierce despight
But hasty heat tempring with suffrance wise
He stayde his hand and gan himselfe advise
To prove his sense and tempt her faigned truth
Wringing her hands in womans pitteous wise
Tho can she weepe to stirre up gentle ruth
Both for her noble bloud and for her tender youth
And said Ah Sir my liege Lord and my love
Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate
And mightie causes wrought in heaven above
Or the blind God that doth me thus amate
For hoped love to winne me certaine hate
Yet thus perforce he bids me do or die
Die is my dew yet rew my wretched state
You whom my hard avenging destinie
Hath made judge of my life or death indifferently
Your owne deare sake forst me at first to leave
My Fathers kingdome There she stopt with teares
Her swollen hart her speech seemd to bereave
And then againe begun My weaker yeares
Captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares
Fly to your fayth for succour and sure ayde
Let me not dye in languor and long teares
Why Dame quoth he what hath ye thus dismayd
What frayes ye that were wont to comfort me affrayd
Love of your selfe she saide and deare constraint
Lets me not sleepe but wast the wearie night
In secret anguish and unpittied plaint
Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight
Her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight
Suspect her truth yet since no' untruth he knew
Her fawning love with foule disdainefull spight
He would not shend but said Deare dame I rew
That for my sake unknowne such griefe unto you grew
Assure your selfe it fell not all to ground
For all so deare as life is to my hart
I deeme your love and hold me to you bound
Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart
Where cause is none but to your rest depart
Not all content yet seemd she to appease
Her mournefull plaintes beguiled of her art
And fed with words that could not chuse but please
So slyding softly forth she turned as to her ease
Long after lay he musing at her mood
Much griev'd to thinke that gentle Dame so light
For whose defence he was to shed his blood
At last dull wearinesse of former fight
Having yrockt asleepe his irkesome spright
That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine
With bowres and beds and Ladies deare delight
But when he saw his labour all was vaine
With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe
By this the Northerne wagoner had set
His sevenfold teme behind the stedfast starre
That was in Ocean waves yet never wet
But firme is fixt and sendeth light from farre
To all that in the wide deepe wandring arre
And chearefull Chaunticlere with his note shrill
Had warned once that Phoebus fiery carre
In hast was climbing up the Easterne hill
Full envious that night so long his roome did fill
When those accursed messengers of hell
That feigning dreame and that faire-forged Spright
Came to their wicked maister and gan tell
Their bootelesse paines and ill succeeding night
Who all in rage to see his skilfull might
Deluded so gan threaten hellish paine
And sad Proserpines wrath them to affright
But when he saw his threatning was but vaine
He cast about and searcht his baleful bookes againe
Eftsoones he tooke that miscreated faire
And that false other Spright on whom he spred
A seeming body of the subtile aire
Like a young Squire in loves and lustybed
His wanton dayes that ever loosely led
Without regard of armes and dreaded fight
Those two he tooke and in a secret bed
Coverd with darknesse and misdeeming night
Them both together laid to joy in vaine delight
Forthwith he runnes with feigned faithfull hast
Unto his guest who after troublous sights
And dreames gan now to take more sound repast
Whom suddenly he wakes with fearfull frights
As one aghast with feends or damned sprights
And to him cals Rise rise unhappy Swaine
That here wex old in sleepe whiles wicked wights
Have knit themselves in Venus shameful chaine
Come see where your false Lady doth her honour staine
All in amaze he suddenly upstart
With sword in hand and with the old man went
Who soone him brought into a secret part
Where that false couple were full closely ment
In wanton lust and leud embracement
Which when he saw he burnt with gealous fire
The eye of reason was with rage yblent
And would have slaine them in his furious ire
But hardly was restreined of that aged sire
Returning to his bed in torment great
And bitter anguish of his guiltie sight
He could not rest but did his stout heart eat
And wast his inward gall with deepe despight
Yrkesome of life and too long lingring night
At last faire Hesperus in highest skie
Had spent his lampe and brought forth dawning light
Then up he rose and clad him hastily
The Dwarfe him brought his steed so both away do fly
Now when the rosy-fingred Morning faire
Weary of aged Tithones saffron bed
Had spread her purple robe through deawy aire
And the high hils Titan discovered
The royall virgin shooke off drowsy-hed
And rising forth out of her baser bowre
Lookt for her knight who far away was fled
And for her Dwarfe that wont to wait each houre
Then gan she waile and weepe to see that woefull stowre
And after him she rode with so much speede
As her slow beast could make but all in vaine
For him so far had borne his light-foot steede
Pricked with wrath and fiery fierce disdaine
That him to follow was but fruitlesse paine
Yet she her weary limbes would never rest
But every hill and dale each wood and plaine
Did search sore grieved in her gentle brest
He so ungently left her whom she loved best
But subtill Archimago when his guests
He saw divided into double parts
And Una wandring in woods and forrests
Th' end of his drift he praisd his divelish arts
That had such might over true meaning harts
Yet rests not so but other meanes doth make
How he may worke unto her further smarts
For her he hated as the hissing snake
And in her many troubles did most pleasure take
He then devisde himselfe how to disguise
For by his mightie science he could take
As many formes and shapes in seeming wise
As ever Proteus to himselfe could make
Sometime a fowle sometime a fish in lake
Now like a foxe now like a dragon fell
That of himselfe he ofte for feare would quake
And oft would flie away O who can tell
The hidden power of herbes and might of Magicke spell
But now seemde best the person to put on
Of that good knight his late beguiled guest
In mighty armes he was yclad anon
And silver shield upon his coward brest
A bloudy crosse and on his craven crest
A bounch of haires discolourd diversly
Full jolly knight he seemde and well addrest
And when he sate upon his courser free
Saint George himself ye would have deemed him to be
But he the knight whose semblaunt he did beare
The true Saint George was wandred far away
Still flying from his thoughts and gealous feare
Will was his guide and griefe led him astray
At last him chaunst to meete upon the way
A faithless Sarazin all arm'd to point
In whose great shield was writ with letters gay
Sans foy full large of limbe and every joint
He was and cared not for God or man a point
He had a faire companion of his way
A goodly Lady clad in scarlot red
Purfled with gold and pearle of rich assay
And like a Persian mitre on her hed
She wore with crowns and owches garnished
The which her lavish lovers to her gave
Her wanton palfrey all was overspred
With tinsell trappings woven like a wave
Whose bridle rung with golden bels and bosses brave
With faire disport and courting dalliaunce
She intertainde her lover all the way
But when she saw the knight his speare advaunce
She soone left off her mirth and wanton play
And bade her knight addresse him to the fray
His foe was nigh at hand He prickt with pride
And hope to winne his Ladies heart that day
Forth spurred fast adowne his coursers side
The red bloud trickling staind the way as he did ride
The knight of the Redcrosse when him he spide
Spurring so hote with rage dispiteous
Gan fairely couch his speare and towards ride
Soone meete they both both fell and furious
That daunted with their forces hideous
Their steeds do stagger and amazed stand
And eke themselves too rudely rigorous
Astonied with the stroke of their owne hand
Doe backe rebut and each to other yeeldeth land
As when two rams stird with ambitious pride
Fight for the rule of the rich fleeced flocke
Their horned fronts so fierce on either side
Do meete that with the terrour of the shocke
Astonied both stand sencelesse as a blocke
Forgetfull of the hanging victory
So stood these twaine unmoved as a rocke
Both staring fierce and holding idely
The broken reliques of their former cruelty
The Sarazin sore daunted with the buffe
Snatcheth his sword and fiercely to him flies
Who well it wards and quyteth cuff with cuff
Each others equall puissaunce envies
And through their iron sides with cruell spies
Does seeke to perce repining courage yields
No foote to foe The flashing fier flies
As from a forge out of their burning shields
And streams of purple bloud new dies the verdant fields
Curse on that Crosse quoth then the Sarazin
That keepes thy body from the bitter fit
Dead long ygoe I wote thou haddest bin
Had not that charme from thee forwarned it
But yet I warne thee now assured sitt
And hide thy head Therewith upon his crest
With rigour so outrageous he smitt
That a large share it hewd out of the rest
And glauncing down his shield from blame him fairly blest
Who thereat wondrous wroth the sleeping spark
Of native vertue gan eftsoones revive
And at his haughtie helmet making mark
So hugely stroke that it the steele did rive
And cleft his head He tumbling downe alive
With bloudy mouth his mother earth did kis
Greeting his grave his grudging ghost did strive
With the fraile flesh at last it flitted is
Whither the soules do fly of men that live amis
The Lady when she saw her champion fall
Like the old ruines of a broken towre
Staid not to waile his woefull funerall
But from him fled away with all her powre
Who after her as hastily gan scowre
Bidding the Dwarfe with him to bring away
The Sarazins shield signe of the conqueroure
Her soone he overtooke and bad to stay
For present cause was none of dread her to dismay
She turning backe with ruefull countenaunce
Cride Mercy mercy Sir vouchsafe to show
On silly Dame subject to hard mischaunce
And to your mighty will Her humblesse low
In so ritch weedes and seeming glorious show
Did much emmove his stout heroicke heart
And said Deare dame your suddin overthrow
Much rueth me but now put feare apart
And tell both who ye be and who that tooke your part
Melting in teares then gan she thus lament
The wretched woman whom unhappy howre
Hath now made thrall to your commandement
Before that angry heavens list to lowre
And fortune false betraide me to your powre
Was O what now availeth that I was
Borne the sole daughter of an Emperour
He that the wide West under his rule has
And high hath set his throne where Tiberis doth pas
He in the first flowre of my freshest age
Betrothed me unto the onely haire
Of a most mighty king most rich and sage
Was never Prince so faithfull and so faire
Was never Prince so meeke and debonaire
But ere my hoped day of spousall shone
My dearest Lord fell from high honours staire
Into the hands of his accursed fone
And cruelly was slaine that shall I ever mone
His blessed body spoild of lively breath
Was afterward I know not how convaid
And fro me hid of whose most innocent death
When tidings came to me unhappy maid
O how great sorrow my sad soule assaid
Then forth I went his woefull corse to find
And many yeares throughout the world I straid
A virgin widow whose deepe wounded mind
With love long time did languish as the striken hind
At last it chaunced this proud Sarazin
To meete me wandring who perforce me led
With him away but yet could never win
The Fort that Ladies hold in soveraigne dread
There lies he now with foule dishonour dead
Who whiles he livde was called proud Sansfoy
The eldest of three brethren all three bred
Of one bad sire whose youngest is Sansjoy
And twixt them both was born the bloudy bold Sansloy
In this sad plight friendlesse unfortunate
Now miserable I Fidessa dwell
Craving of you in pitty of my state
To do none ill if please ye not do well
He in great passion all this while did dwell
More busying his quicke eyes her face to view
Then his dull eares to heare what she did tell
And said Faire Lady hart of flint would rew
The undeserved woes and sorrowes which ye shew
Henceforth in safe assuraunce may ye rest
Having both found a new friend you to aid
And lost an old foe that did you molest
Better new friend then an old foe is said
With chaunge of cheare the seeming simple maid
Let fall her eyen as shamefast to the earth
And yeelding soft in that she nought gain-said
So forth they rode he feining seemely merth
And she coy lookes so dainty they say maketh derth
Long time they thus together traveiled
Till weary of their way they came at last
Where grew two goodly trees that faire did spred
Their armes abroad with gray mosse overcast
And their greene leaves trembling with every blast
Made a calme shadow far in compasse round
The fearfull Shepheard often there aghast
Under them never sat ne wont there sound
His mery oaten pipe but shund th' unlucky ground
But this good knight soone as he them can spie
For the cool shade him thither hastly got
For golden Phoebus now ymounted hie
From fiery wheeles of his faire chariot
Hurled his beame so scorching cruell hot
That living creature mote it not abide
And his new Lady it endured not
There they alight in hope themselves to hide
From the fierce heat and rest their weary limbs a tide
Faire seemely pleasaunce each to other makes
With goodly purposes there as they sit
And in his falsed fancy he her takes
To be the fairest wight that lived yit
Which to expresse he bends his gentle wit
And thinking of those braunches greene to frame
A girlond for her dainty forehead fit
He pluckt a bough out of whose rift there came
Small drops of gory bloud that trickled down the same
Therewith a piteous yelling voyce was heard
Crying O spare with guilty hands to teare
My tender sides in this rough rynd embard
But fly ah fly far hence away for feare
Least to you hap that happened to me heare
And to this wretched Lady my deare love
O too deare love love bought with death too deare
Astond he stood and up his haire did hove
And with that suddein horror could no member move
At last whenas the dreadfull passion
Was overpast and manhood well awake
Yet musing at the straunge occasion
And doubting much his sence he thus bespake
What voyce of damned Ghost from Limbo lake
Or guilefull spright wandring in empty aire
Both which fraile men do oftentimes mistake
Sends to my doubtfull eares these speaches rare
And ruefull plaints me bidding guiltlesse bloud to spare
Then groning deepe Nor damned Ghost quoth he
Nor guileful sprite to thee these wordes doth speake
But once a man Fradubio now a tree
Wretched man wretched tree whose nature weake
A cruell witch her cursed will to wreake
Hath thus transformd and plast in open plaines
Where Boreas doth blow full bitter bleake
And scorching Sunne does dry my secret vaines
For though a tree I seeme yet cold and heat me paines
Say on Fradubio then or man or tree
Quoth then the knight by whose mischievous arts
Art thou misshaped thus as now I see
He oft finds med'cine who his griefe imparts
But double griefs afflict concealing harts
As raging flames who striveth to suppresse
The author then said he of all my smarts
Is one Duessa a false sorceresse
That many errant knights hath brought to wretchednesse
In prime of youthly yeares when corage hot
The fire of love and joy of chevalree
First kindled in my brest it was my lot
To love this gentle Lady whom ye see
Now not a Lady but a seeming tree
With whom as once I rode accompanyde
Me chaunced of a knight encountred bee
That had a like faire Lady by his syde
Like a faire Lady but did fowle Duessa hyde
Whose forged beauty he did take in hand
All other Dames to have exceeded farre
I in defence of mine did likewise stand
Mine that did then shine as the Morning starre
So both to battell fierce arraunged arre
In which his harder fortune was to fall
Under my speare such is the dye of warre
His Lady left as a prise martiall
Did yield her comely person to be at my call
So doubly lov'd of Ladies unlike faire
Th' one seeming such the other such indeede
One day in doubt I cast for to compare
Whether in beauties glorie did exceede
A Rosy girlond was the victors meede
Both seemde to win and both seemde won to bee
So hard the discord was to be agreede
Fraelissa was as faire as faire mote bee
And ever false Duessa seemde as faire as shee
The wicked witch now seeing all this while
The doubtfull ballaunce equally to sway
What not by right she cast to win by guile
And by her hellish science raisd streightway
A foggy mist that overcast the day
And a dull blast that breathing on her face
Dimmed her former beauties shining ray
And with foule ugly forme did her disgrace
Then was she faire alone when none was faire in place
Then cride she out Fye fye deformed wight
Whose borrowed beautie now appeareth plaine
To have before bewitched all mens sight
O leave her soone or let her soone be slaine
Her loathly visage viewing with disdaine
Eftsoones I thought her such as she me told
And would have kild her but with faigned paine
The false witch did my wrathfull hand with-hold
So left her where she now is turnd to treen mould
Then forth I tooke Duessa for my Dame
And in the witch unweeting joyd long time
Ne ever wist but that she was the same
Till on a day that day is every Prime
When Witches wont do penance for their crime
I chaunst to see her in her proper hew
Bathing her selfe in origane and thyme
A filthy foule old woman I did vew
That ever to have toucht her I did deadly rew
Her neather parts misshapen monstruous
Were hidd in water that I could not see
But they did seeme more foule and hideous
Then womans shape man would beleeve to bee
Thensforth from her most beastly companie
I gan refraine in minde to slip away
Soone as appeard safe opportunitie
For danger great if not assur'd decay
I saw before mine eyes if I were knowne to stray
The divelish hag by chaunges of my cheare
Perceiv'd my thought and drownd in sleepie night
With wicked herbs and ointments did besmeare
My body all through charms and magicke might
That all my senses were bereaved quight
Then brought she me into this desert waste
And by my wretched lovers side me pight
Where now enclosd in wooden wals full faste
Banisht from living wights our wearie dayes we waste
But how long time said then the Elfin knight
Are you in this misformed house to dwell
We may not chaunge quoth he this evil plight
Till we be bathed in a living well
That is the terme prescribed by the spell
O how said he mote I that well out find
That may restore you to your wonted well
Time and suffised fates to former kynd
Shall us restore none else from hence may us unbynd
The false Duessa now Fidessa hight
Heard how in vaine Fradubio did lament
And knew well all was true But the good knight
Full of sad feare and ghastly dreriment
When all this speech the living tree had spent
The bleeding bough did thrust into the ground
That from the bloud he might be innocent
And with fresh clay did close the wooden wound
Then turning to his Lady dead with feare her found
Her seeming dead he found with feigned feare
As all unweeting of that well she knew
And paynd himselfe with busie care to reare
Her out of carelesse swowne Her eyelids blew
And dimmed sight with pale and deadly hew
At last she up gan lift with trembling cheare
Her up he tooke too simple and too trew
And oft her kist At length all passed feare
He set her on her steede and forward forth did beare
Nought is there under heav'ns wide hollownesse
That moves more deare compassion of mind
Then beautie brought t' unworthy wretchednesse
Through envies snares or fortunes freakes unkind
I whether lately through her brightnesse blind
Or through alleageance and fast fealtie
Which I do owe unto all woman kind
Feele my hart perst with so great agonie
When such I see that all for pittie I could die
And now it is empassioned so deepe
For fairest Unaes sake of whom I sing
That my fraile eyes these lines with teares do steepe
To thinke how she through guilefull handeling
Though true as touch though daughter of a king
Though faire as ever living wight was faire
Though nor in word nor deede ill meriting
Is from her knight divorced in despaire
And her due loves deriv'd to that vile witches share
Yet she most faithfull Ladie all this while
Forsaken wofull solitarie mayd
Far from all peoples prease as in exile
In wildernesse and wastfull deserts strayd
To seeke her knight who subtilly betrayd
Through that late vision which th' Enchaunter wrought
Had her abandond She of nought affrayd
Through woods and wastnesse wide him daily sought
Yet wished tydings none of him unto her brought
One day nigh wearie of the yrkesome way
From her unhastie beast she did alight
And on the grasse her daintie limbes did lay
In secret shadow farre from all mens sight
From her faire head her fillet she undight
And laid her stole aside Her angels face
As the great eye of heaven shyned bright
And made a sunshine in the shadie place
Did never mortall eye behold such heavenly grace
It fortuned out of the thickest wood
A ramping Lyon rushed suddainly
Hunting full greedy after salvage blood
Soone as the royall virgin he did spy
With gaping mouth at her ran greedily
To have attonce devourd her tender corse
But to the pray when as he drew more ny
His bloody rage asswaged with remorse
And with the sight amazd forgat his furious forse
In stead thereof he kist her wearie feet
And lickt her lilly hands with fawning tong
As he her wronged innocence did weet
O how can beautie maister the most strong
And simple truth subdue avenging wrong
Whose yeelded pride and proud submission
Still dreading death when she had marked long
Her hart gan melt in great compassion
And drizling teares did shed for pure affection
The Lyon Lord of every beast in field
Quoth she his princely puissance doth abate
And mightie proud to humble weake does yield
Forgetfull of the hungry rage which late
Him prickt in pittie of my sad estate
But he my Lyon and my noble Lord
How does he find in cruell hart to hate
Her that him lov'd and ever most adord
As the God of my life why hath he me abhord
Redounding teares did choke th' end of her plaint
Which softly ecchoed from the neighbour wood
And sad to see her sorrowfull constraint
The kingly beast upon her gazing stood
With pittie calmd downe fell his angry mood
At last in close hart shutting up her paine
Arose the virgin borne of heavenly brood
And to her snowy Palfrey got againe
To seeke her strayed Champion if she might attaine
The Lyon would not leave her desolate
But with her went along as a strong gard
Of her chast person and a faithfull mate
Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard
Still when she slept he kept both watch and ward
And when she wakt he waited diligent
With humble service to her will prepard
From her faire eyes he tooke commaundement
And ever by her lookes conceived her intent
Long she thus traveiled through deserts wyde
By which she thought her wandring knight shold pas
Yet never shew of living wight espyde
Till that at length she found the troden gras
In which the tract of peoples footing was
Under the steepe foot of a mountaine hore
The same she followes till at last she has
A damzell spyde slow footing her before
That on her shoulders sad a pot of water bore
To whom approching she to her gan call
To weet if dwelling place were nigh at hand
But the rude wench her answerd nought at all
She could not heare nor speake nor understand
Till seeing by her side the Lyon stand
With suddaine feare her pitcher downe she threw
And fled away for never in that land
Face of faire Ladie she before did vew
And that dread Lyons looke her cast in deadly hew
Full fast she fled ne never lookt behynd
As if her life upon the wager lay
And home she came whereas her mother blynd
Sate in eternall night nought could she say
But suddaine catching hold did her dismay
With quaking hands and other signes of feare
Who full of ghastly fright and cold affray
Gan shut the dore By this arrived there
Dame Una wearie Dame and entrance did requere
Which when none yeelded her unruly Page
With his rude claws the wicket open rent
And let her in where of his cruell rage
Nigh dead with feare and faint astonishment
She found them both in darkesome corner pent
Where that old woman day and night did pray
Upon her beads devoutly penitent
Nine hundred Pater nosters every day
And thrise nine hundred Aves she was wont to say
And to augment her painefull pennance more
Thrise every weeke in ashes she did sit
And next her wrinkled skin rough sackcloth wore
And thrise three times did fast from any bit
But now for feare her beads she did forget
Whose needlesse dread for to remove away
Faire Una framed words and count'nance fit
Which hardly doen at length she gan them pray
That in their cotage small that night she rest her may
The day is spent and commeth drowsie night
When every creature shrowded is in sleepe
Sad Una downe her laies in wearie plight
And at her feete the Lyon watch doth keepe
In stead of rest she does lament and weepe
For the late losse of her deare loved knight
And sighes and grones and ever more does steepe
Her tender brest in bitter teares all night
All night she thinks too long and often lookes for light
Now when Aldeboran was mounted hie
Above the shynie Cassiopeias chaire
And all in deadly sleepe did drowned lie
One knocked at the dore and in would fare
He knocked fast and often curst and sware
That readie entrance was not at his call
For on his backe a heavy load he bare
Of nightly stelths and pillage severall
Which he had got abroad by purchase criminall
He was to weete a stout and sturdy thiefe
Wont to robbe Churches of their ornaments
And poore mens boxes of their due reliefe
Which given was to them for good intents
The holy Saints of their rich vestiments
He did disrobe when all men carelesse slept
And spoild the Priests of their habiliments
Whiles none the holy things in safety kept
Then he by conning sleights in at the window crept
And all that he by right or wrong could find
Unto this house he brought and did bestow
Upon the daughter of this woman blind
Abessa daughter of Corceca slow
With whom he whoredome usd that few did know
And fed her fat with feast of offerings
And plentie which in all the land did grow
Ne spared he to give her gold and rings
And now he to her brought part of his stolen things
Thus long the dore with rage and threats he bet
Yet of those fearfull women none durst rize
The Lyon frayed them him in to let
He would no longer stay him to advize
But open breakes the dore in furious wize
And entring is when that disdainfull beast
Encountring fierce him suddaine doth surprize
And seizing cruell clawes on trembling brest
Under his Lordly foot him proudly hath supprest
Him booteth not resist nor succour call
His bleeding hart is in the vengers hand
Who streight him rent in thousand peeces small
And quite dismembred hath the thirsty land
Drunke up his life his corse left on the strand
His fearefull friends weare out the wofull night
Ne dare to weepe nor seeme to understand
The heavie hap which on them is alight
Affraid least to themselves the like mishappen might
Now when broad day the world discovered has
Up Una rose up rose the Lyon eke
And on their former journey forward pas
In wayes unknowne her wandring knight to seeke
With paines farre passing that long wandring Greeke
That for his love refused deitie
Such were the labours of his Lady meeke
Still seeking him that from her still did flie
Then furthest from her hope when most she weened nie
Soone as she parted thence the fearfull twaine
That blind old woman and her daughter deare
Came forth and finding Kirkrapine there slaine
For anguish great they gan to rend their heare
And beat their brests and naked flesh to teare
And when they both had wept and wayld their fill
Then forth they ran like two amazed deare
Halfe mad through malice and revenging will
To follow her that was the causer of their ill
Whom overtaking they gan loudly bray
With hollow howling and lamenting cry
Shamefully at her rayling all the way
And her accusing of dishonesty
That was the flowre of faith and chastity
And still amidst her rayling she did pray
That plagues and mischiefs and long misery
Might fall on her and follow all the way
And that in endlesse error she might ever stray
But when she saw her prayers nought prevaile
She backe returned with some labour lost
And in the way as shee did weepe and waile
A knight her met in mighty armes embost
Yet knight was not for all his bragging bost
But subtill Archimag that Una sought
By traynes into new troubles to have tost
Of that old woman tidings he besought
If that of such a Ladie she could tellen ought
Therewith she gan her passion to renew
And cry and curse and raile and rend her heare
Saying that harlot she too lately knew
That caused her shed so many a bitter teare
And so forth told the story of her feare
Much seemed he to mone her haplesse chaunce
And after for that Ladie did inquere
Which being taught he forward gan advaunce
His fair enchaunted steed and eke his charmed launce
Ere long he came where Una traveild slow
And that wilde Champion wayting her besyde
Whom seeing such for dread he durst not show
Himselfe too nigh at hand but turned wyde
Unto an hill from whence when she him spyde
By his like seeming shield her knight by name
She weend it was and towards him gan ryde
Approaching nigh she wist it was the same
And with faire fearefull humblesse towards him shee came
And weeping said Ah my long lacked Lord
Where have ye bene thus long out of my sight
Much feared I to have bene quite abhord
Or ought have done that ye displeasen might
That should as death unto my deare heart light
For since mine eye your joyous sight did mis
My chearefull day is turnd to chearelesse night
And eke my night of death the shadow is
But welcome now my light and shining lampe of blis
He thereto meeting said My dearest Dame
Farre be it from your thought and fro my will
To thinke that knighthood I so much should shame
As you to leave that have me loved still
And chose in Faery court of meere goodwill
Where noblest knights were to be found on earth
The earth shall sooner leave her kindly skill
To bring forth fruit and make eternall derth
Then I leave you my liefe yborne of heavenly berth
And sooth to say why I left you so long
Was for to seeke adventure in strange place
Where Archimago said a felon strong
To many knights did daily worke disgrace
But knight he now shall never more deface
Good cause of mine excuse that mote ye please
Well to accept and evermore embrace
My faithfull service that by land and seas
Have vowd you to defend now then your plaint appease
His lovely words her seemd due recompence
Of all her passed paines one loving howre
For many yeares of sorrow can dispence
A dram of sweet is worth a pound of sowre
She has forgot how many a woful stowre
For him she late endurd she speakes no more
Of past true is that true love hath no powre
To looken backe his eyes be fixt before
Before her stands her knight for whom she toyld so sore
Much like as when the beaten marinere
That long hath wandred in the Ocean wide
Oft soust in swelling Tethys saltish teare
And long time having tand his tawney hide
With blustring breath of heaven that none can bide
And scorching flames of fierce Orions hound
Soone as the port from farre he has espide
His chearefull whistle merrily doth sound
And Nereus crownes with cups his mates him pledg around
Such joy made Una when her knight she found
And eke th' enchaunter joyous seemd no lesse
Then the glad marchant that does vew from ground
His ship farre come from watrie wildernesse
He hurles out vowes and Neptune oft doth blesse
So forth they past and all the way they spent
Discoursing of her dreadful late distresse
In which he askt her what the Lyon ment
Who told her all that fell in journey as she went
They had not ridden farre when they might see
One pricking towards them with hastie heat
Full strongly armd and on a courser free
That through his fiercenesse fomed all with sweat
And the sharpe yron did for anger eat
When his hot ryder spurd his chauffed side
His looke was sterne and seemed still to threat
Cruell revenge which he in hart did hyde
And on his shield Sans loy in bloudie lines was dyde
When nigh he drew unto this gentle payre
And saw the Red-crosse which the knight did beare
He burnt in fire and gan eftsoones prepare
Himselfe to battell with his couched speare
Loth was that other and did faint through feare
To taste th' untryed dint of deadly steele
But yet his Lady did so well him cheare
That hope of new goodhap he gan to feele
So bent his speare and spurd his horse with yron heele
But that proud Paynim forward came so fierce
And full of wrath that with his sharp-head speare
Through vainly crossed shield he quite did pierce
And had his staggering steede not shrunke for feare
Through shield and bodie eke he should him beare
Yet so great was the puissance of his push
That from his saddle quite he did him beare
He tombling rudely downe to ground did rush
And from his gored wound a well of bloud did gush
Dismounting lightly from his loftie steed
He to him lept in mind to reave his life
And proudly said Lo there the worthie meed
Of him that slew Sansfoy with bloudie knife
Henceforth his ghost freed from repining strife
In peace may passen over Lethe lake
When mourning altars purgd with enemies life
The blacke infernall Furies doen aslake
Life from Sansfoy thou tookst Sansloy shall from thee take
Therewith in haste his helmet gan unlace
Till Una cried O hold that heavie hand
Deare Sir what ever that thou be in place
Enough is that thy foe doth vanquisht stand
Now at thy mercy Mercie not withstand
For he is one the truest knight alive
Though conquered now he lie on lowly land
And whilest him fortune favourd faire did thrive
In bloudie field therefore of life him not deprive
Her piteous words might not abate his rage
But rudely rending up his helmet would
Have slaine him straight but when he sees his age
And hoarie head of Archimago old
His hasty hand he doth amazed hold
And halfe ashamed wondred at the sight
For that old man well knew he though untold
In charmes and magicke to have wondrous might
Ne ever wont in field ne in round lists to fight
And said Why Archimago lucklesse syre
What doe I see what hard mishap is this
That hath thee hither brought to taste mine yre
Or thine the fault or mine the error is
Instead of foe to wound my friend amis
He answered nought but in a traunce still lay
And on those guilefull dazed eyes of his
The cloude of death did sit Which doen away
He left him lying so ne would no lenger stay
But to the virgin comes who all this while
Amased stands her selfe so mockt to see
By him who has the guerdon of his guile
For so misfeigning her true knight to bee
Yet is she now in more perplexitie
Left in the hand of that same Paynim bold
From whom her booteth not at all to flie
Who by her cleanly garment catching hold
Her from her Palfrey pluckt her visage to behold
But her fierce servant full of kingly awe
And high disdaine whenas his soveraine Dame
So rudely handled by her foe he sawe
With gaping jawes full greedy at him came
And ramping on his shield did weene the same
Have reft away with his sharpe rending clawes
But he was stout and lust did now inflame
His corage more that from his griping pawes
He hath his shield redeem'd and foorth his swerd he drawes
O then too weake and feeble was the forse
Of salvage beast his puissance to withstand
For he was strong and of so mightie corse
As ever wielded speare in warlike hand
And feates of armes did wisely understand
Eftsoones he perced through his chaufed chest
With thrilling point of deadly yron brand
And launcht his Lordly hart with death opprest
He roar'd aloud whiles life forsooke his stubborne brest
Who now is left to keepe the forlorne maid
From raging spoile of lawlesse victors will
Her faithfull gard remov'd her hope dismaid
Her selfe a yielded pray to save or spill
He now Lord of the field his pride to fill
With foule reproches and disdainfull spight
Her vildly entertaines and will or nill
Beares her away upon his courser light
Her prayers nought prevaile his rage is more of might
And all the way with great lamenting paine
And piteous plaints she filleth his dull eares
That stony hart could riven have in twaine
And all the way she wets with flowing teares
But he enrag'd with rancor nothing heares
Her servile beast yet would not leave her so
But followes her farre off ne ought he feares
To be partaker of her wandring woe
More mild in beastly kind then that her beastly foe
Young knight whatever that dost armes professe
And through long labours huntest after fame
Beware of fraud beware of ficklenesse
In choice and change of thy deare loved Dame
Least thou of her beleeve too lightly blame
And rash misweening doe thy hart remove
For unto knight there is no greater shame
Then lightnesse and inconstancie in love
That doth this Redcrosse knights ensample plainly prove
Who after that he had faire Una lorne
Through light misdeeming of her loialtie
And false Duessa in her sted had borne
Called Fidess' and so supposd to bee
Long with her traveild till at last they see
A goodly building bravely garnished
The house of mightie Prince it seemd to bee
And towards it a broad high way that led
All bare through peoples feet which thither traveiled
Great troupes of people traveild thitherward
Both day and night of each degree and place
But few returned having scaped hard
With balefull beggerie or foule disgrace
Which ever after in most wretched case
Like loathsome lazars by the hedges lay
Thither Duessa bad him bend his pace
For she is wearie of the toilesome way
And also nigh consumed is the lingring day
A stately Pallace built of squared bricke
Which cunningly was without morter laid
Whose wals were high but nothing strong nor thick
And golden foile all over them displaid
That purest skye with brightnesse they dismaid
High lifted up were many loftie towres
And goodly galleries farre over laid
Full of faire windowes and delightful bowres
And on the top a Diall told the timely howres
It was a goodly heape for to behould
And spake the praises of the workmans wit
But full great pittie that so faire a mould
Did on so weake foundation ever sit
For on a sandie hill that still did flit
And fall away it mounted was full hie
That every breath of heaven shaked it
And all the hinder parts that few could spie
Were ruinous and old but painted cunningly
Arrived there they passed in forth right
For still to all the gates stood open wide
Yet charge of them was to a Porter hight
Cald Malvenu who entrance none denide
Thence to the hall which was on every side
With rich array and costly arras dight
Infinite sorts of people did abide
There waiting long to win the wished sight
Of her that was the Lady of that Pallace bright
By them they passe all gazing on them round
And to the Presence mount whose glorious vew
Their frayle amazed senses did confound
In living Princes court none ever knew
Such endlesse richesse and so sumptuous shew
Ne Persia selfe the nourse of pompous pride
Like ever saw And there a noble crew
Of Lordes and Ladies stood on every side
Which with their presence faire the place much beautifide
High above all a cloth of State was spred
And a rich throne as bright as sunny day
On which there sate most brave embellished
With royall robes and gorgeous array
A mayden Queene that shone as Titans ray
In glistring gold and peerelesse pretious stone
Yet her bright blazing beautie did assay
To dim the brightnesse of her glorious throne
As envying her selfe that too exceeding shone
Exceeding shone like Phoebus fairest childe
That did presume his fathers firie wayne
And flaming mouthes of steedes unwonted wilde
Through highest heaven with weaker hand to rayne
Proud of such glory and advancement vaine
While flashing beames do daze his feeble eyen
He leaves the welkin way most beaten plaine
And rapt with whirling wheeles inflames the skyen
With fire not made to burne but fairely for to shyne
So proud she shyned in her Princely state
Looking to heaven for earth she did disdayne
And sitting high for lowly she did hate
Lo underneath her scornefull feete was layne
A dreadfull Dragon with an hideous trayne
And in her hand she held a mirrhour bright
Wherein her face she often vewed fayne
And in her selfe-lov'd semblance tooke delight
For she was wondrous faire as any living wight
Of griesly Pluto she the daughter was
And sad Proserpina the Queene of hell
Yet did she thinke her pearlesse worth to pas
That parentage with pride so did she swell
And thundring Jove that high in heaven doth dwell
And wield the world she claymed for her syre
Or if that any else did Jove excell
For to the highest she did still aspyre
Or if ought higher were then that did it desyre
And proud Lucifera men did her call
That made her selfe a Queene and crownd to be
Yet rightfull kingdome she had none at all
Ne heritage of native soveraintie
But did usurpe with wrong and tyrannie
Upon the scepter which she now did hold
Ne ruld her Realmes with lawes but pollicie
And strong advizement of six wisards old
That with their counsels bad her kingdome did uphold
Soone as the Elfin knight in presence came
And false Duessa seeming Lady faire
A gentle Husher Vanitie by name
Made rowme and passage for them did prepaire
So goodly brought them to the lowest staire
Of her high throne where they on humble knee
Making obeyssance did the cause declare
Why they were come her royall state to see
To prove the wide report of her great Majestee
With loftie eyes halfe loth to looke so low
She thanked them in her disdainefull wise
Ne other grace vouchsafed them to show
Of Princesse worthy scarse them bad arise
Her Lordes and Ladies all this while devise
Themselves to setten forth to straungers sight
Some frounce their curled haire in courtly guise
Some prancke their ruffes and others trimly dight
Their gay attire each others greater pride does spight
Goodly they all that knight do entertaine
Right glad with him to have increast their crew
But to Duess' each one himselfe did paine
All kindnesse and faire courtesie to shew
For in that court whylome her well they knew
Yet the stout Faerie mongst the middest crowd
Thought all their glorie vaine in knightly vew
And that great Princesse too exceeding prowd
That to strange knight no better countenance allowd
Suddein upriseth from her stately place
The royall Dame and for her coche did call
All hurtlen forth and she with Princely pace
As faire Aurora in her purple pall
Out of the east the dawning day doth call
So forth she comes her brightnesse brode doth blaze
The heapes of people thronging in the hall
Do ride each other upon her to gaze
Her glorious glitterand light doth all mens eyes amaze
So forth she comes and to her coche does clyme
Adorned all with gold and girlonds gay
That seemd as fresh as Flora in her prime
And strove to match in royall rich array
Great Junoes golden chaire the which they say
The Gods stand gazing on when she does ride
To Joves high house through heavens bras-paved way
Drawne of faire Pecocks that excell in pride
And full of Argus eyes their tailes dispredden wide
But this was drawne of six unequall beasts
On which her six sage Counsellours did ryde
Taught to obay their bestiall beheasts
With like conditions to their kinds applyde
Of which the first that all the rest did guyde
Was sluggish Idlenesse the nourse of sin
Upon a slouthful Asse he chose to ryde
Arayd in habit blacke and amis thin
Like to an holy Monck the service to begin
And in his hand his Portesse still he bare
That much was worne but therein little red
For of devotion he had little care
Still drownd in sleepe and most of his dayes ded
Scarse could he once uphold his heavie hed
To looken whether it were night or day
May seeme the wayne was very evill led
When such an one had guiding of the way
That knew not whether right he went or else astray
From worldly cares himselfe he did esloyne
And greatly shunned manly exercise
From every worke he chalenged essoyne
For contemplation sake yet otherwise
His life he led in lawlesse riotise
By which he grew to grievous malady
For in his lustlesse limbs through evill guise
A shaking fever raignd continually
Such one was Idlenesse first of this company
And by his side rode loathsome Gluttony
Deformed creature on a filthie swyne
His belly was up-blowne with luxury
And eke with fatnesse swollen were his eyne
And like a Crane his necke was long and fyne
With which he swallowed up excessive feast
For want whereof poore people oft did pyne
And all the way most like a brutish beast
He spued up his gorge that all did him deteast
In greene vine leaves he was right fitly clad
For other clothes he could not weare for heat
And on his head an yvie girland had
From under which fast trickled downe the sweat
Still as he rode he somewhat still did eat
And in his hand did beare a bouzing can
Of which he supt so oft that on his seat
His dronken corse he scarse upholden can
In shape and life more like a monster then a man
Unfit he was for any worldly thing
And eke unhable once to stirre or go
Not meet to be of counsell to a king
Whose mind in meat and drinke was drowned so
That from his friend he seldome knew his fo
Full of diseases was his carcas blew
And a dry dropsie through his flesh did flow
Which by misdiet daily greater grew
Such one was Gluttony the second of that crew
And next to him rode lustfull Lechery
Upon a bearded Goat whose rugged haire
And whally eyes the signe of gelosy
Was like the person selfe whom he did beare
Who rough and blacke and filthy did appeare
Unseemely man to please faire Ladies eye
Yet he of Ladies oft was loved deare
When fairer faces were bid standen by
O who does know the bent of womens fantasy
In a greene gowne he clothed was full faire
Which underneath did hide his filthinesse
And in his hand a burning hart he bare
Full of vaine follies and new fanglenesse
For he was false and fraught with ficklenesse
And learned had to love with secret lookes
And well could daunce and sing with ruefulnesse
And fortunes tell and read in loving bookes
And thousand other wayes to bait his fleshly hookes
Inconstant man that loved all he saw
And lusted after all that he did love
Ne would his looser life be tide to law
But joyd weak wemens hearts to tempt and prove
If from their loyall loves he might them move
Which lewdnesse fild him with reprochfull paine
Of that fowle evill which all men reprove
That rots the marrow and consumes the braine
Such one was Lecherie the third of all this traine
And greedy Avarice by him did ride
Upon a Camell loaden all with gold
Two iron coffers hong on either side
With precious mettall full as they might hold
And in his lap an heape of coine he told
For of his wicked pelfe his God he made
And unto hell him selfe for money sold
Accursed usurie was all his trade
And right and wrong ylike in equall ballaunce waide
His life was nigh unto deaths doore yplast
And thred-bare cote and cobled shoes he ware
Ne scarse good morsell all his life did tast
But both from backe and belly still did spare
To fill his bags and richesse to compare
Yet chylde ne kinsman living had he none
To leave them to but thorough daily care
To get and nightly feare to lose his owne
He led a wretched life unto him selfe unknowne
Most wretched wight whom nothing might suffise
Whose greedy lust did lacke in greatest store
Whose need had end but no end covetise
Whose wealth was want whose plenty made him pore
Who had enough yet wished ever more
A vile disease and eke in foote and hand
A grievous gout tormented him full sore
That well he could not touch nor go nor stand
Such one was Avarice the fourth of this faire band
And next to him malicious Envie rode
Upon a ravenous wolfe and still did chaw
Betweene his cankred teeth a venemous tode
That all the poison ran about his chaw
But inwardly he chawed his owne maw
At neighbours wealth that made him ever sad
For death it was when any good he saw
And wept that cause of weeping none he had
But when he heard of harme he wexed wondrous glad
All in a kirtle of discolourd say
He clothed was ypainted full of eyes
And in his bosome secretly there lay
An hatefull Snake the which his taile uptyes
In many folds and mortall sting implyes
Still as he rode he gnasht his teeth to see
Those heapes of gold with griple Covetyse
And grudged at the great felicitie
Of proud Lucifera and his owne companie
He hated all good workes and vertuous deeds
And him no lesse that any like did use
And who with gracious bread the hungry feeds
His almes for want of faith he doth accuse
So every good to bad he doth abuse
And eke the verse of famous Poets witt
He does backebite and spightfull poison spues
From leprous mouth on all that ever writt
Such one vile Envie was that fifte in row did sitt
And him beside rides fierce revenging Wrath
Upon a Lion loth for to be led
And in his hand a burning brond he hath
The which he brandisheth about his hed
His eyes did hurle forth sparkles fiery red
And stared sterne on all that him beheld
As ashes pale of hew and seeming ded
And on his dagger still his hand he held
Trembling through hasty rage when choler in him sweld
His ruffin raiment all was staind with blood
Which he had spilt and all to rags yrent
Through unadvized rashnesse woxen wood
For of his hands he had no governement
Ne car'd for bloud in his avengement
But when the furious fit was overpast
His cruell facts he often would repent
Yet wilfull man he never would forecast
How many mischieves should ensue his heedlesse hast
Full many mischiefes follow cruell Wrath
Abhorred bloodshed and tumultuous strife
Unmanly murder and unthrifty scath
Bitter despight with rancours rusty knife
And fretting griefe the enemy of life
All these and many evils moe haunt ire
The swelling Splene and Frenzy raging rife
The shaking Palsey and Saint Fraunces fire
Such one was Wrath the last of this ungodly tire
And after all upon the wagon beame
Rode Sathan with a smarting whip in hand
With which he forward lasht the laesie teme
So oft as Slowth still in the mire did stand
Hugh routs of people did about them band
Showting for joy and still before their way
A foggy mist had covered all the land
And underneath their feet all scattered lay
Dead sculs and bones of men whose life had gone astray
So forth they marchen in this goodly sort
To take the solace of the open aire
And in fresh flowring fields themselves to sport
Emongst the rest rode that false Lady faire
The foule Duessa next unto the chaire
Of proud Lucifera as one of the traine
But that good knight would not so nigh repaire
Him selfe estraunging from their joyaunce vaine
Whose fellowship seemd far unfit for warlike swaine
So having solaced themselves a space
With pleasaunce of the breathing fields yfed
They backe retourned to the Princely Place
Whereas an errant knight in armes ycled
And heathnish shield wherein with letters red
Was writ Sans joy they new arrived find
Enflam'd with fury and fiers hardy-hed
He seemd in hart to harbour thoughts unkind
And nourish bloudy vengeaunce in his bitter mind
Who when the shamed shield of slaine Sansfoy
He spide with that same Faery champions page
Bewraying him that did of late destroy
His eldest brother burning all with rage
He to him leapt and that same envious gage
Of victors glory from him snatcht away
But th' Elfin knight which ought that warlike wage
Disdaind to loose the meed he wonne in fray
And him rencountring fierce reskewd the noble pray
Therewith they gan to hurtlen greedily
Redoubted battaile ready to darrayne
And clash their shields and shake their swords on hy
That with their sturre they troubled all the traine
Till that great Queene upon eternall paine
Of high displeasure that ensewen might
Commaunded them their fury to refraine
And if that either to that shield had right
In equall lists they should the morrow next it fight
Ah dearest Dame quoth then the Paynim bold
Pardon the error of enraged wight
Whom great griefe made forget the raines to hold
Of reasons rule to see this recreant knight
No knight but treachour full of false despight
And shamefull treason who through guile hath slayn
The prowest knight that ever field did fight
Even stout Sansfoy O who can then refrayn
Whose shield he beares renverst the more to heape disdayn
And to augment the glorie of his guile
His dearest love the faire Fidessa loe
Is there possessed of the traytour vile
Who reapes the harvest sowen by his foe
Sowen in bloudy field and bought with woe
That brothers hand shall dearely well requight
So be O Queene you equall favour showe
Him litle answerd th' angry Elfin knight
He never meant with words but swords to plead his right
But threw his gauntlet as a sacred pledge
His cause in combat the next day to try
So been they parted both with harts on edge
To be aveng'd each on his enimy
That night they pas in joy and jollity
Feasting and courting both in bowre and hall
For Steward was excessive Gluttonie
That of his plenty poured forth to all
Which doen the Chamberlain Slowth did to rest them call
Now whenas darkesome night had all displayed
Her coleblacke curtein over brightest skye
The warlike youthes on dayntie couches layd
Did chace away sweet sleepe from sluggish eye
To muse on meanes of hoped victory
But whenas Morpheus had with leaden mace
Arrested all that courtly company
Up-rose Duessa from her resting place
And to the Paynims lodging comes with silent pace
Whom broad awake she finds in troublous fit
Forecasting how his foe he might annoy
And him amoves with speaches seeming fit
Ah deare Sansjoy next dearest to Sansfoy
Cause of my new griefe cause of my new joy
Joyous to see his ymage in mine eye
And greev'd to thinke how foe did him destroy
That was the flowre of grace and chevalrye
Lo his Fidessa to thy secret faith I flye
With gentle wordes he can her fairely greet
And bad say on the secret of her hart
Then sighing soft I learne that litle sweet
Oft tempred is quoth she with muchell smart
For since my brest was launcht with lovely dart
Of deare Sans foy I never joyed howre
But in eternall woes my weaker hart
Have wasted loving him with all my powre
And for his sake have felt full many an heavie stowre
At last when perils all I weened past
And hop'd to reape the crop of all my care
Into new woes unweeting I was cast
By this false faytor who unworthy ware
His worthy shield whom he with guilefull snare
Entrapped slew and brought to shamefull grave
Me silly maid away with him he bare
And ever since hath kept in darksome cave
For that I would not yeeld that to Sans foy I gave
But since faire Sunne hath sperst that lowring clowd
And to my loathed life now shewes some light
Under your beames I will me safely shrowd
From dreaded storme of his disdainfull spight
To you th' inheritance belongs by right
Of brothers prayse to you eke longs his love
Let not his love let not his restlesse spright
Be unreveng'd that calles to you above
From wandring Stygian shores where it doth endlesse move
Thereto said he Faire Dame be nought dismaid
For sorrowes past their griefe is with them gone
Ne yet of present perill be affraid
For needlesse feare did never vantage none
And helplesse hap it booteth not to mone
Dead is Sansfoy his vitall paines are past
Though greeved ghost for vengeance deepe do grone
He lives that shall him pay his dewties last
And guiltie Elfin blood shall sacrifice in hast
O but I feare the fickle freakes quoth shee
Of fortune false and oddes of armes in field
Why Dame quoth he what oddes can ever bee
Where both do fight alike to win or yield
Yea but quoth she he beares a charmed shield
And eke enchaunted armes that none can perce
Ne none can wound the man that does them wield
Charmd or enchaunted answerd he then ferce
I no whit reck ne you the like need to reherce
But faire Fidessa sithens fortunes guile
Or enimies powre hath now captived you
Returne from whence ye came and rest a while
Till morrow next that I the Elfe subdew
And with Sansfoyes dead dowry you endew
Ay me that is a double death she said
With proud foes sight my sorrow to renew
Where ever yet I be my secret aid
Shall follow you So passing forth she him obaid
THE noble hart that harbours vertuous thought
And is with child of glorious great intent
Can never rest untill it forth have brought
Th' eternall brood of glorie excellent
Such restlesse passion did all night torment
The flaming corage of that Faery knight
Devizing how that doughtie turnament
With greatest honour he atchieven might
Still did he wake and still did watch for dawning light
At last the golden Orientall gate
Of greatest heaven gan to open faire
And Phoebus fresh as bridegrome to his mate
Came dauncing forth shaking his deawie haire
And hurls his glistring beams through gloomy aire
Which when the wakeful Elfe perceiv'd streightway
He started up and did him selfe prepaire
In sunbright armes and battailous array
For with that Pagan proud he combat will that day
And forth he comes into the commune hall
Where earely waite him many a gazing eye
To weet what end to straunger knights may fall
There many Minstrales maken melody
To drive away the dull melancholy
And many Bardes that to the trembling chord
Can tune their timely voyces cunningly
And many Chroniclers that can record
Old loves and warres for Ladies doen by many a Lord
Soone after comes the cruell Sarazin
In woven maile all armed warily
And sternly lookes at him who not a pin
Does care for looke of living creatures eye
They bring them wines of Greece and Araby
And daintie spices fetcht from furthest Ynd
To kindle heat of corage privily
And in the wine a solemne oth they bynd
T' observe the sacred lawes of armes that are assynd
At last forth comes that far renowmed Queene
With royall pomp and Princely majestie
She is ybrought unto a paled greene
And placed under stately canapee
The warlike feates of both those knights to see
On th' other side in all mens open vew
Duessa placed is and on a tree
Sans-foy his shield is hangd with bloody hew
Both those the lawrell girlonds to the victor dew
A shrilling trompet sownded from on hye
And unto battaill bad them selves addresse
Their shining shieldes about their wrestes they tye
And burning blades about their heads do blesse
The instruments of wrath and heavinesse
With greedy force each other doth assayle
And strike so fiercely that they do impresse
Deepe dinted furrowes in the battred mayle
The yron walles to ward their blowes are weak and fraile
The Sarazin was stout and wondrous strong
And heaped blowes like yron hammers great
For after bloud and vengeance he did long
The knight was fiers and full of youthly heat
And doubled strokes like dreaded thunders threat
For all for prayse and honour he did fight
Both stricken strike and beaten both do beat
That from their shields forth flyeth firie light
And helmets hewen deepe show marks of eithers might
So th' one for wrong the other strives for right
As when a Gryfon seized of his pray
A Dragon fiers encountreth in his flight
Through widest ayre making his ydle way
That would his rightfull ravine rend away
With hideous horror both together smight
And souce so sore that they the heavens affray
The wise Soothsayer seeing so sad sight
Th' amazed vulgar tels of warres and mortall fight
So th' one for wrong the other strives for right
And each to deadly shame would drive his foe
The cruell steele so greedily doth bight
In tender flesh that streames of bloud down flow
With which the armes that earst so bright did show
Into a pure vermillion now are dyde
Great ruth in all the gazers harts did grow
Seeing the gored woundes to gape so wyde
That victory they dare not wish to either side
At last the Paynim chaunst to cast his eye
His suddein eye flaming with wrathful fyre
Upon his brothers shield which hong thereby
Therewith redoubled was his raging yre
And said Ah wretched sonne of wofull syre
Doest thou sit wayling by blacke Stygian lake
Whilest here thy shield is hangd for victors hyre
And sluggish german doest thy forces slake
To after-send his foe that him may overtake
Goe caytive Elfe him quickly overtake
And soone redeeme from his long wandring woe
Goe guiltie ghost to him my message make
That I his shield have quit from dying foe
Therewith upon his crest he stroke him so
That twise he reeled readie twise to fall
End of the doubtfull battell deemed tho
The lookers on and lowd to him gan call
The false Duessa Thine the shield and I and all
Soone as the Faerie heard his Ladie speake
Out of his swowning dreame he gan awake
And quickning faith that earst was woxen weake
The creeping deadly cold away did shake
Tho mov'd with wrath and shame and Ladies sake
Of all attonce he cast avengd to bee
And with so' exceeding furie at him strake
That forced him to stoupe upon his knee
Had he not stouped so he should have cloven bee
And to him said Goe now proud Miscreant
Thy selfe thy message do to german deare
Alone he wandring thee too long doth want
Goe say his foe thy shield with his doth beare
Therewith his heavie hand he high gan reare
Him to have slaine when loe a darkesome clowd
Upon him fell he no where doth appeare
But vanisht is The Elfe him calls alowd
But answer none receives the darkness him does shrowd
In haste Duessa from her place arose
And to him running said O prowest knight
That ever Ladie to her love did chose
Let now abate the terror of your might
And quench the flame of furious despight
And bloudie vengeance lo th' infernall powres
Covering your foe with cloud of deadly night
Have borne him hence to Plutoes balefull bowres
The conquest yours I yours the shield the glory yours
Not all so satisfide with greedie eye
He sought all round about his thristie blade
To bath in bloud of faithlesse enemy
Who all that while lay hid in secret shade
He standes amazed how he thence should fade
At last the trumpets Triumph sound on hie
And running Heralds humble homage made
Greeting him goodly with new victorie
And to him brought the shield the cause of enmitie
Wherewith he goeth to that soveraine Queene
And falling her before on lowly knee
To her makes present of his service seene
Which she accepts with thankes and goodly gree
Greatly advauncing his gay chevalree
So marcheth home and by her takes the knight
Whom all the people follow with great glee
Shouting and clapping all their hands on hight
That all the aire it fils and flyes to heaven bright
Home is he brought and laid in sumptuous bed
Where many skilfull leaches him abide
To salve his hurts that yet still freshly bled
In wine and oyle they wash his woundes wide
And softly can embalme on every side
And all the while most heavenly melody
About the bed sweet musicke did divide
Him to beguile of griefe and agony
And all the while Duessa wept full bitterly
As when a wearie traveller that strayes
By muddy shore of broad seven-mouthed Nile
Unweeting of the perillous wandring wayes
Doth meete a cruell craftie Crocodile
Which in false griefe hyding his harmefull guile
Doth weepe full sore and sheddeth tender teares
The foolish man that pitties all this while
His mournefull plight is swallowed up unawares
Forgetfull of his owne that mindes anothers cares
So wept Duessa untill eventide
That shyning lampes in Joves high house were light
Then forth she rose ne lenger would abide
But comes unto the place where th' Hethen knight
In slombring swownd nigh voyd of vitall spright
Lay cover'd with inchaunted cloud all day
Whom when she found as she him left in plight
To wayle his woefull case she would not stay
But to the easterne coast of heaven makes speedy way
Where griesly Night with visage deadly sad
That Phoebus chearefull face durst never vew
And in a foule blacke pitchie mantle clad
She findes forth comming from her darkesome mew
Where she all day did hide her hated hew
Before the dore her yron charet stood
Alreadie harnessed for journey new
And coleblacke steedes yborne of hellish brood
That on their rustie bits did champ as they were wood
Who when she saw Duessa sunny bright
Adornd with gold and jewels shining cleare
She greatly grew amazed at the sight
And th' unacquainted light began to feare
For never did such brightnesse there appeare
And would have backe retyred to her cave
Until the witches speech she gan to heare
Saying Yet O thou dreaded Dame I crave
Abide till I have told the message which I have
She stayd and foorth Duessa gan proceede
O thou most auncient Grandmother of all
More old then Jove whom thou at first didst breede
Or that great house of Gods caelestiall
Which wast begot in Daemogorgons hall
And sawst the secrets of the world unmade
Why suffredst thou thy Nephewes deare to fall
With Elfin sword most shamefully betrade
Lo where the stout Sansjoy doth sleepe in deadly shade
And him before I saw with bitter eyes
The bold Sansfoy shrinke underneath his speare
And now the pray of fowles in field he lyes
Nor wayld of friends nor layd on groning beare
That whylome was to me too dearely deare
O what of Gods then boots it to be borne
If old Aveugles sonnes so evill heare
Or who shall not great Nightes children scorne
When two of three her Nephews are so fowle forlorne
Up then up dreary Dame of darknesse Queene
Go gather up the reliques of thy race
Or else goe them avenge and let be seene
That dreaded Night in brightest day hath place
And can the children of faire light deface
Her feeling speeches some compassion moved
In hart and chaunge in that great mothers face
Yet pittie in her hart was never proved
Till then for evermore she hated never loved
And said Deare daughter rightly may I rew
The fall of famous children borne of mee
And good successes which their foes ensew
But who can turne the streame of destinee
Or breake the chayne of strong necessitee
Which fast is tyde to Joves eternall seat
The sonnes of Day he favoureth I see
And by my ruines thinkes to make them great
To make one great by others losse is bad excheat
Yet shall they not escape so freely all
For some shall pay the price of others guilt
And he the man that made Sansfoy to fall
Shall with his owne bloud price that he has spilt
But what art thou that telst of Nephews kilt
I that do seeme not I Duessa am
Quoth she how ever now in garments gilt
And gorgeous gold arrayd I to thee came
Duessa I the daughter of Deceipt and Shame
Then bowing downe her aged backe she kist
The wicked witch saying In that faire face
The false resemblance of Deceipt I wist
Did closely lurke yet so true-seeming grace
It carried that I scarce in darkesome place
Could it discerne though I the mother bee
Of falshood and roote of Duessaes race
O welcome child whom I have longd to see
And now have seene unwares Lo now I go with thee
Then to her yron wagon she betakes
And with her beares the fowle welfavourd witch
Through mirkesome aire her readie way she makes
Her twyfold Teme of which two blacke as pitch
And two were browne yet each to each unlich
Did softly swim away ne ever stampe
Unlesse she chaunst their stubborne mouths to twitch
Then foming tarre their bridles they would champe
And trampling the fine element would fiercely rampe
So well they sped that they be come at length
Unto the place whereas the Paynim lay
Devoid of outward sense and native strength
Coverd with charmed cloud from vew of day
And sight of men since his late luckelesse fray
His cruell wounds with cruddy bloud congeald
They binden up so wisely as they may
And handle softly till they can be healed
So lay him in her charet close in night concealed
And all the while she stood upon the ground
The wakefull dogs did never cease to bay
As giving warning of th' unwonted sound
With which her yron wheeles did them affray
And her darke griesly looke them much dismay
The messenger of death the ghastly Owle
With drery shriekes did also her bewray
And hungry Wolves continually did howle
At her abhorred face so filthy and so fowle
Thence turning backe in silence soft they stole
And brought the heavie corse with easie pace
To yawning gulfe of deepe Avernus hole
By that same hole an entrance darke and bace
With smoake and sulphure hiding all the place
Descends to hell there creature never past
That backe returned without heavenly grace
But dreadfull Furies which their chaines have brast
And damned sprights sent forth to make ill men aghast
By that same way the direfull dames doe drive
Their mournefull charet fild with rusty blood
And downe to Plutoes house are come bilive
Which passing through on every side them stood
The trembling ghosts with sad amazed mood
Chattring their yron teeth and staring wide
With stonie eyes and all the hellish brood
Of feends infernall flockt on every side
To gaze on earthly wight that with the Night durst ride
They pas the bitter waves of Acheron
Where many soules sit wailing woefully
And come to fiery flood of Phlegeton
Whereas the damned ghosts in torments fry
And with sharpe shrilling shriekes doe bootlesse cry
Cursing high Jove the which them thither sent
The house of endlesse paine is built thereby
In which ten thousand sorts of punishment
The cursed creatures doe eternally torment
Before the threshold dreadfull Cerberus
His three deformed heads did lay along
Curled with thousand adders venemous
And lilled forth his bloudie flaming tong
At them he gan to reare his bristles strong
And felly gnarre until Dayes enemy
Did him appease then downe his taile he hong
And suffred them to passen quietly
For she in hell and heaven had power equally
There was Ixion turned on a wheele
For daring tempt the Queene of heaven to sin
And Sisyphus an huge round stone did reele
Against an hill ne might from labour lin
There thirsty Tantalus hong by the chin
And Tityus fed a vulture on his maw
Typhoeus joynts were stretched on a gin
Theseus condemnd to endlesse slouth by law
And fifty sisters water in leake vessels draw
They all beholding worldly wights in place
Leave off their worke unmindfull of their smart
To gaze on them who forth by them doe pace
Till they be come unto the furthest part
Where was a Cave ywrought by wondrous art
Deepe darke uneasie dolefull comfortlesse
In which sad Aesculapius farre apart
Emprisond was in chaines remedilesse
For that Hippolytus rent corse he did redresse
Hippolytus a jolly huntsman was
That wont in charett chace the foming Bore
He all his Peeres in beauty did surpas
But Ladies love as losse of time forbore
His wanton stepdame loved him the more
But when she saw her offred sweets refused
Her love she turnd to hate and him before
His father fierce of treason false accused
And with her gealous termes his open eares abused
Who all in rage his Sea-god syre besought
Some cursed vengeaunce on his sonne to cast
From surging gulf two monsters straight were brought
With dread whereof his chasing steedes aghast
Both charet swift and huntsman overcast
His goodly corps on ragged cliffs yrent
Was quite dismembred and his members chast
Scattered on every mountaine as he went
That of Hippolytus was left no moniment
His cruell step-dame seeing what was donne
Her wicked dayes with wretched knife did end
In death avowing th' innocence of her sonne
Which hearing his rash Syre began to rend
His haire and hastie tongue that did offend
Tho gathering up the relicks of his smart
By Dianes meanes who was Hippolyts frend
Them brought to Aesculape that by his art
Did heale them all againe and joyned every part
Such wondrous science in mans wit to raine
When Jove avizd that could the dead revive
And fates expired could renew againe
Of endlesse life he might him not deprive
But unto hell did thrust him downe alive
With flashing thunderbolt ywounded sore
Where long remaining he did alwaies strive
Himselfe with salves to health for to restore
And slake the heavenly fire that raged evermore
There auncient Night arriving did alight
From her nigh wearie waine and in her armes
To Aesculapius brought the wounded knight
Whom having softly disarayd of armes
Tho gan to him discover all his harmes
Beseeching him with prayer and with praise
If either salves or oyles or herbes or charmes
A fordonne wight from dore of death mote raise
He would at her request prolong her nephews daies
Ah Dame quoth he thou temptest me in vaine
To dare the thing which daily yet I rew
And the old cause of my continued paine
With like attempt to like end to renew
Is not enough that thrust from heaven dew
Here endlesse penance for one fault I pay
But that redoubled crime with vengeance new
Thou biddest me to eeke can Night defray
The wrath of thundring Jove that rules both night and day
Not so quoth she but sith that heavens king
From hope of heaven hath thee excluded quight
Why fearest thou that canst not hope for thing
And fearest not that more thee hurten might
Now in the powre of everlasting Night
Goe to then O thou farre renowmed sonne
Of great Apollo shew thy famous might
In medicine that else hath to thee wonne
Great paines and greater praise both never to be donne
Her words prevaild And then the learned leach
His cunning hand gan to his wounds to lay
And all things else the which his art did teach
Which having seene from thence arose away
The mother of dread darknesse and let stay
Aveugles sonne there in the leaches cure
And backe returning tooke her wonted way
To runne her timely race whilst Phoebus pure
In westerne waves his weary wagon did recure
The false Duessa leaving noyous Night
Returnd to stately pallace of Dame Pride
Where when she came she found the Faery knight
Departed thence albe his woundes wide
Not throughly heald unreadie were to ride
Good cause he had to hasten thence away
For on a day his wary Dwarfe had spide
Where in a dongeon deepe huge numbers lay
Of caytive wretched thrals that wayled night and day
A ruefull sight as could be seene with eie
Of whom he learned had in secret wise
The hidden cause of their captivitie
How mortgaging their lives to Covetise
Through wastfull Pride and wanton Riotise
They were by law of that proud Tyrannesse
Provokt with Wrath and Envies false surmise
Condemned to that Dongeon mercilesse
Where they should live in woe and die in wretchednesse
There was that great proud king of Babylon
That would compell all nations to adore
And him as onely God to call upon
Till through celestiall doome throwne out of dore
Into an Oxe he was transform'd of yore
There also was king Croesus that enhaunst
His hart too high through his great riches store
And proud Antiochus the which advaunst
His cursed hand gainst God and on his altars daunst
And them long time before great Nimrod was
That first the world with sword and fire warrayd
And after him old Ninus farre did pas
In princely pompe of all the world obayd
There also was that mightie Monarch layd
Low under all yet above all in pride
That name of native syre did fowle upbrayd
And would as Ammons sonne be magnifide
Till scornd of God and man a shamefull death he dide
All these together in one heape were throwne
Like carkases of beasts in butchers stall
And in another corner wide were strowne
The antique ruines of the Romaines fall
Great Romulus the Grandsyre of them all
Proud Tarquin and too lordly Lentulus
Stout Scipio and stubborne Hanniball
Ambitious Sylla and sterne Marius
High Caesar great Pompey and fierce Antonius
Amongst these mightie men were wemen mixt
Proud wemen vaine forgetfull of their yoke
The bold Semiramis whose sides transfixt
With sonnes own blade her fowle reproches spoke
Faire Sthenoboea that her selfe did choke
With wilfull cord for wanting of her will
High minded Cleopatra that with stroke
Of Aspes sting her selfe did stoutly kill
And thousands moe the like that did that dongeon fill
Besides the endlesse routs of wretched thralles
Which thither were assembled day by day
From all the world after their wofull falles
Through wicked pride and wasted wealthes decay
But most of all which in the Dongeon lay
Fell from high Princes courts or Ladies bowres
Where they in idle pompe or wanton play
Consumed had their goods and thriftlesse howres
And lastly throwne themselves into these heavy stowres
Whose case when as the carefull Dwarfe had tould
And made ensample of their mournefull sight
Unto his maister he no lenger would
There dwell in perill of like painefull plight
But early rose and ere that dawning light
Discovered had the world to heaven wyde
He by a privie Posterne tooke his flight
That of no envious eyes he mote be spyde
For doubtlesse death ensewd if any him descryde
Scarse could he footing find in that fowle way
For many corses like a great Lay-stall
Of murdred men which therein strowed lay
Without remorse or decent funerall
Which all through that great Princesse pride did fall
And came to shamefull end And them beside
Forth ryding underneath the castell wall
A donghill of dead carkases he spide
The dreadfull spectacle of that sad house of Pride
As when a ship that flyes faire under saile
An hidden rocke escaped hath unwares
That lay in waite her wrack for to bewaile
The Marriner yet halfe amazed stares
At perill past and yet in doubt ne dares
To joy at his foole-happie oversight
So doubly is distrest twixt joy and cares
The dreadlesse courage of this Elfin knight
Having escapt so sad ensamples in his sight
Yet sad he was that his too hastie speede
The faire Duess' had forst him leave behind
And yet more sad that Una his deare dreed
Her truth had staind with treason so unkind
Yet crime in her could never creature find
But for his love and for her owne selfe sake
She wandred had from one to other Ynd
Him for to seeke ne ever would forsake
Till her unwares the fiers Sansloy did overtake
Who after Archimagoes fowle defeat
Led her away into a forest wilde
And turning wrathfull fyre to lustfull heat
With beastly sin thought her to have defilde
And made the vassal of his pleasures wilde
Yet first he cast by treatie and by traynes
Her to persuade that stubborne fort to yilde
For greater conquest of hard love he gaynes
That workes it to his will then he that it constraines
With fawning words he courted her awhile
And looking lovely and oft sighing sore
Her constant hart did tempt with diverse guile
But wordes and lookes and sighes she did abhore
As rocke of Diamond steadfast evermore
Yet for to feed his fyrie lustfull eye
He snatcht the vele that hong her face before
Then gan her beautie shyne as brightest skye
And burnt his beastly hart t'efforce her chastitye
So when he saw his flatt'ring artes to fayle
And subtile engines bett from batteree
With greedy force he gan the fort assayle
Whereof he weend possessed soone to bee
And with rich spoile of ransackt chastitee
Ah heavens that do this hideous act behold
And heavenly virgin thus outraged see
How can ye vengeance just so long withold
And hurle not flashing flames upon that Paynim bold
The pitteous maiden carefull comfortlesse
Does throw out thrilling shriekes and shrieking cryes
The last vaine helpe of womens great distresse
And with loud plaints importuneth the skyes
That molten starres do drop like weeping eyes
And Phoebus flying so most shameful sight
His blushing face in foggy cloud implyes
And hides for shame What wit of mortall wight
Can now devise to quit a thrall from such a plight
Eternal providence exceeding thought
Where none appeares can make herselfe a way
A wondrous way it for this Lady wrought
From Lyons clawes to pluck the griped pray
Her shrill outcryes and shriekes so loud did bray
That all the woodes and forestes did resownd
A troupe of Faunes and Satyres far away
Within the wood were dauncing in a rownd
Whiles old Sylvanus slept in shady arber sownd
Who when they heard that pitteous strained voice
In haste forsooke their rurall meriment
And ran towards the far rebownded noyce
To weet what wight so loudly did lament
Unto the place they come incontinent
Whom when the raging Sarazin espide
A rude mishapen monstrous rablement
Whose like he never saw he durst not bide
But got his ready steed and fast away gan ride
The wyld woodgods arrived in the place
There find the virgin dolefull desolate
With ruffled rayments and faire blubbred face
As her outrageous foe had left her late
And trembling yet through feare of former hate
All stand amazed at so uncouth sight
And gin to pittie her unhappie state
All stand astonied at her beautie bright
In their rude eyes unworthy of so wofull plight
She more amaz'd in double dread doth dwell
And every tender part for feare doth shake
As when a greedie Wolfe through hunger fell
A seely Lambe farre from the flocke does take
Of whom he meanes his bloudie feast to make
A Lyon spyes fast running towards him
The innocent pray in hast he does forsake
Which quit from death yet quakes in every lim
With chaunge of feare to see the Lyon looke so grim
Such fearefull fit assaid her trembling hart
Ne word to speake ne joynt to move she had
The salvage nation feele her secret smart
And read her sorrow in her count'nance sad
Their frowning forheads with rough hornes yclad
And rustick horror all a side doe lay
And gently grenning show a semblance glad
To comfort her and feare to put away
Their backward bent knees teach her humbly to obay
The doubtfull Damzell dare not yet commit
Her single person to their barbarous truth
But still twixt feare and hope amazd does sit
Late learnd what harme to hasty trust ensu'th
They in compassion of her tender youth
And wonder of her beautie soveraine
Are wonne with pitty and unwonted ruth
And all prostrate upon the lowly plaine
Do kisse her feete and fawne on her with count'nance faine
Their harts she ghesseth by their humble guise
And yieldes her to extremitie of time
So from the ground she fearlesse doth arise
And walketh forth without suspect of crime
They all as glad as birdes of joyous Prime
Thence lead her forth about her dauncing round
Shouting and singing all a shepheards ryme
And with greene braunches strowing all the ground
Do worship her as Queene with olive girlond cround
And all the way their merry pipes they sound
That all the woods with doubled Eccho ring
And with their horned feet do weare the ground
Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant Spring
So towards old Sylvanus they her bring
Who with the noyse awaked commeth out
To weet the cause his weake steps governing
And aged limbs on Cypresse stadle stout
And with an yvie twyne his wast is girt about
Far off he wonders what them makes so glad
Or Bacchus merry fruit they did invent
Or Cybeles franticke rites have made them mad
They drawing nigh unto their God present
That flowre of faith and beautie excellent
The God himselfe vewing that mirrhour rare
Stood long amazd and burnt in his intent
His owne faire Dryope now he thinkes not faire
And Pholoe fowle when her to this he doth compaire
The woodborne people fall before her flat
And worship her as Goddesse of the wood
And old Sylvanus selfe bethinkes not what
To thinke of wight so faire but gazing stood
In doubt to deeme her borne of earthly brood
Sometimes Dame Venus selfe he seemes to see
But Venus never had so sober mood
Sometimes Diana he her takes to bee
But misseth bow and shaftes and buskins to her knee
By vew of her he ginneth to revive
His ancient love and dearest Cyparisse
And calles to mind his pourtraiture alive
How faire he was and yet not faire to this
And how he slew with glauncing dart amisse
A gentle Hynd the which the lovely boy
Did love as life above all worldly blisse
For griefe whereof the lad n'ould after joy
But pynd away in anguish and selfe-wild annoy
The wooddy Nymphes faire Hamadryades
Her to behold do thither runne apace
And all the troupe of light-foot Naiades
Flocke all about to see her lovely face
But when they vewed have her heavenly grace
They envy her in their malitious mind
And fly away for feare of fowle disgrace
But all the Satyres scorne their woody kind
And henceforth nothing faire but her on earth they find
Glad of such lucke the luckelesse lucky maid
Did her content to please their feeble eyes
And long time with that salvage people staid
To gather breath in many miseries
During which time her gentle wit she plyes
To teach them truth which worshipt her in vaine
And made her th' Image of Idolatryes
But when their bootlesse zeale she did restraine
From her own worship they her Asse would worship fayn
It fortuned a noble warlike knight
By just occasion to that forrest came
To seeke his kindred and the lignage right
From whence he tooke his well deserved name
He had in armes abroad wonne muchell fame
And fild far lands with glorie of his might
Plaine faithfull true and enimy of shame
And ever lov'd to fight for Ladies right
But in vaine glorious frayes he litle did delight
A Satyres sonne yborne in forrest wyld
By straunge adventure as it did betyde
And there begotten of a Lady myld
Faire Thyamis the daughter of Labryde
That was in sacred bands of wedlocke tyde
To Therion a loose unruly swayne
Who had more joy to raunge the forrest wyde
And chase the salvage beast with busie payne
Then serve his Ladies love and wast in pleasures vayne
The forlorne mayd did with loves longing burne
And could not lacke her lovers company
But to the wood she goes to serve her turne
And seeke her spouse that from her still does fly
And followes other game and venery
A Satyre chaunst her wandring for to finde
Then home he suffred her for to retyre
For ransome leaving him the late borne childe
Whom till to ryper yeares he gan aspire
He noursled up in life and manners wilde
Emongst wild beasts and woods from lawes of men exilde
For all he taught the tender ymp was but
To banish cowardize and bastard feare
His trembling hand he would him force to put
Upon the Lyon and the rugged Beare
And from the she Beares teats her whelps to teare
And eke wyld roaring Buls he would him make
To tame and ryde their backes not made to beare
And the Robuckes in flight to overtake
That every beast for feare of him did fly and quake
Thereby so fearlesse and so fell he grew
That his owne sire and maister of his guise
Did often tremble at his horrid vew
And oft for dread of hurt would him advise
The angry beasts not rashly to despise
Nor too much to provoke for he would learne
The Lyon stoup to him in lowly wise
A lesson hard and make the Libbard sterne
Leave roaring when in rage he for revenge did earne
And for to make his powre approved more
Wyld beasts in yron yokes he would compell
The spotted Panther and the tusked Bore
The Pardale swift and the tigre cruell
The Antelope and Wolfe both fierce and fell
And them constraine in equall teme to draw
Such joy he had their stubborne harts to quell
And sturdie courage tame with dreadfull aw
That his beheast they feared as a tyrans law
His loving mother came upon a day
Unto the woods to see her little sonne
And chaunst unwares to meet him in the way
After his sportes and cruell pastime donne
When after him a Lyonesse did runne
That roaring all with rage did lowd requere
Her children deare whom he away had wonne
The Lyon whelpes she saw how he did beare
And lull in rugged armes withouten childish feare
The fearefull Dame all quaked at the sight
And turning backe gan fast to fly away
Untill with love revokt from vaine affright
She hardly yet perswaded was to stay
And then to him these womanish words gan say
Ah Satyrane my dearling and my joy
For love of me leave off this dreadfull play
To dally thus with death is no fit toy
Go find some other play-fellowes mine own sweet boy
In these and like delights of bloudy game
He trayned was till ryper yeares he raught
And there abode whilst any beast of name
Walkt in that forest whom he had not taught
To feare his force and then his courage haught
Desird of forreine foemen to be knowne
And far abroad for straunge adventures sought
In which his might was never overthrowne
But through all Faery lond his famous worth was blown
Yet evermore it was his manner faire
After long labours and adventures spent
Unto those native woods for to repaire
To see his sire and offspring auncient
And now he thither came for like intent
Where he unwares the fairest Una found
Straunge Lady in so straunge habiliment
Teaching the Satyres which her sat around
Trew sacred lore which from her sweet lips did redound
He wondred at her wisedome heavenly rare
Whose like in womens wit he never knew
And when her curteous deeds he did compare
Gan her admire and her sad sorrowes rew
Blaming of Fortune which such troubles threw
And joyd to make proofe of her crueltie
On gentle Dame so hurtlesse and so trew
Thenceforth he kept her goodly company
And learnd her discipline of faith and veritie
But she all vowd unto the Redcrosse knight
His wandring perill closely did lament
Ne in this new acquaintaunce could delight
But her deare heart with anguish did torment
And all her wit in secret counsels spent
How to escape At last in privie wise
To Satyrane she shewed her intent
Who glad to gain such favour gan devise
How with that pensive Maid he best might thence arise
So on a day when Satyres all were gone
To do their service to Sylvanus old
The gentle virgin left behind alone
He led away with courage stout and bold
Too late it was to Satyres to be told
Or ever hope recover her againe
In vaine he seekes that having cannot hold
So fast he carried her with carefull paine
That they the woods are past and come now to the plaine
The better part now of the lingring day
They traveild had whenas they farre espide
A weary wight forwandring by the way
And towards him they gan in haste to ride
To weete of newes that did abroad betide
Or tydings of her knight of the Redcrosse
But he them spying gan to turne aside
For feare as seemd or for some feigned losse
More greedy they of newes fast towards him do crosse
A silly man in simple weedes forworne
And soild with dust of the long dried way
His sandales were with toilsome travell torne
And face all tand with scorching sunny ray
As he had traveild many a sommers day
Through boyling sands of Arabie and Ynde
And in his hand a Jacobs staffe to stay
His wearie limbes upon and eke behind
His scrip did hang in which his needments he did bind
The knight approaching nigh of him inquerd
Tidings of warre and of adventures new
But warres nor new adventures none he herd
Then Una gan to aske if ought he knew
Or heard abroad of that her champion trew
That in his armour bare a croslet red
Aye me Deare dame quoth he well may I rew
To tell the sad sight which mine eies have red
These eies did see that knight both living and eke ded
That cruell word her tender hart so thrild
That suddein cold did runne through every vaine
And stony horrour all her sences fild
With dying fit that downe she fell for paine
The knight her lightly reared up againe
And comforted with curteous kind reliefe
Then wonne from death she bad him tellen plaine
The further processe of her hidden griefe
The lesser pangs can beare who hath endur'd the chiefe
Then gan the Pilgrim thus I chaunst this day
This fatall day that shall I ever rew
To see two knights in travell on my way
A sory sight arraung'd in battell new
Both breathing vengeaunce both of wrathfull hew
My fearefull flesh did tremble at their strife
To see their blades so greedily imbrew
That drunke with bloud yet thristed after life
What more the Redcrosse knight was slaine with Paynim knife
Ah dearest Lord quoth she how might that bee
And he the stoughtest knight that ever wonne
Ah dearest dame quoth he how might I see
The thing that might not be and yet was donne
Where is said Satyrane that Paynims sonne
That him of life and us of joy hath reft
Not far away quoth he he hence doth wonne
Foreby a fountaine where I late him left
Washing his bloudy wounds that through the steele were cleft
Therewith the knight thence marched forth in hast
Whiles Una with huge heavinesse opprest
Could not for sorrow follow him so fast
And soone he came as he the place had ghest
Whereas that Pagan proud him selfe did rest
In secret shadow by a fountaine side
Even he it was that earst would have supprest
Faire Una whom when Satyrane espide
With fowle reprochfull words he boldly him defide
And said Arise thou cursed Miscreaunt
That hast with knightlesse guile and trecherous train
Faire knighthood fowly shamed and doest vaunt
That good knight of the Redcrosse to have slain
Arise and with like treason now maintain
Thy guilty wrong or els thee guilty yield
The Sarazin this hearing rose amain
And catching up in hast his three-square shield
And shining helmet soone him buckled to the field
And drawing nigh him said Ah misborne Elfe
In evill houre thy foes thee hither sent
Anothers wrongs to wreake upon thy selfe
Yet ill thou blamest me for having blent
My name with guile and traiterous intent
That Redcrosse knight perdie I never slew
But had he beene where earst his arms were lent
Th' enchaunter vaine his errour should not rew
But thou his errour shalt I hope now proven trew
Therewith they gan both furious and fell
To thunder blowes and fiersly to assaile
Each other bent his enimy to quell
That with their force they perst both plate and maile
And made wide furrowes in their fleshes fraile
That it would pitty any living eie
Large floods of bloud adowne their sides did raile
But floods of bloud could not them satisfie
Both hungred after death both chose to win or die
So long they fight and fell revenge pursue
That fainting each themselves to breathen let
And oft refreshed battell oft renue
As when two Bores with rancling malice met
Their gory sides fresh bleeding fiercely fret
Til breathlesse both them selves aside retire
Where foming wrath their cruell tuskes they whet
And trample th' earth the whiles they may respire
Then backe to fight againe new breathed and entire
So fiersly when these knights had breathed once
They gan to fight returne increasing more
Their puissant force and cruell rage attonce
With heaped strokes more hugely then before
That with their drerie wounds and bloudy gore
They both deformed scarsely could be known
By this sad Una fraught with anguish sore
Led with their noise which through the aire was thrown
Arriv'd wher they in erth their fruitles bloud had sown
Whom all so soone as that proud Sarazin
Espide he gan revive the memory
Of his lewd lusts and late attempted sin
And left the doubtfull battell hastily
To catch her newly offred to his eie
But Satyrane with strokes him turning staid
And sternely bad him other businesse plie
Then hunt the steps of pure unspotted Maid
Wherewith he all enrag'd these bitter speaches said
O foolish faeries son what fury mad
Hath thee incenst to hast thy doefull fate
Were it not better I that Lady had
Then that thou hadst repented it too late
Most senseless man he that himselfe doth hate
To love another Lo then for thine ayd
Here take thy lovers token on thy pate
So they two fight the whiles the royall Mayd
Fledd farre away of that proud Paynim sore afrayd
But that false Pilgrim which that leasing told
Being in deed old Archimage did stay
In secret shadow all this to behold
And much rejoiced in their bloudy fray
But when he saw the Damsell passe away
He left his stond and her pursewd apace
In hope to bring her to her last decay
But for to tell her lamentable cace
And eke this battels end will need another place
What man so wise what earthly wit so ware
As to discry the crafty cunning traine
By which deceipt doth maske in visour faire
And cast her colours dyed deepe in graine
To seeme like Truth whose shape she well can faine
And fitting gestures to her purpose frame
The guiltlesse man with guile to entertaine
Great maistresse of her art was that false Dame
The false Duessa cloked with Fidessaes name
Who when returning from the drery Night
She fownd not in that perilous house of Pryde
Where she had left the noble Redcrosse knight
Her hoped pray she would no lenger bide
But forth she went to seeke him far and wide
Ere long she fownd whereas he wearie sate
To rest him selfe foreby a fountaine side
Disarmed all of yron-coted Plate
And by his side his steed the grassy forage ate
He feedes upon the cooling shade and bayes
His sweatie forehead in the breathing wind
Which through the trembling leaves full gently playes
Wherein the cherefull birds of sundry kind
Do chaunt sweet musick to delight his mind
The Witch approaching gan him fairely greet
And with reproch of carelesnesse unkind
Upbrayd for leaving her in place unmeet
With fowle words tempring faire soure gall with hony sweet
Unkindnesse past they gan of solace treat
And bathe in pleasaunce of the joyous shade
Which shielded them against the boyling heat
And with greene boughes decking a gloomy glade
About the fountaine like a girlond made
Whose bubbling wave did ever freshly well
Ne ever would through fervent sommer fade
The sacred Nymph which therein wont to dwell
Was out of Dianes favour as it then befell
The cause was this One day when Phoebe fayre
With all her band was following the chace
This Nymph quite tyr'd with heat of scorching ayre
Sat downe to rest in middest of the race
The goddesse wroth gan fowly her disgrace
And bad the waters which from her did flow
Be such as she her selfe was then in place
Thenceforth her waters waxed dull and slow
And all that drinke thereof do faint and feeble grow
Hereof this gentle knight unweeting was
And lying downe upon the sandie graile
Drunke of the streame as cleare as cristall glas
Eftsoones his manly forces gan to faile
And mightie strong was turned to feeble fraile
His chaunged powres at first them selves not felt
Till crudled cold his corage gan assaile
And cheareful bloud in faintnesse chill did melt
Which like a fever fit through all his body swelt
Yet goodly court he made still to his Dame
Pourd out in loosnesse on the grassy grownd
Both carelesse of his health and of his fame
Till at the last he heard a dreadfull sownd
Which through the wood loud bellowing did rebownd
That all the earth for terrour seemd to shake
And trees did tremble Th' Elfe therewith astownd
Upstarted lightly from his looser make
And his unready weapons gan in hand to take
But ere he could his armour on him dight
Or get his shield his monstrous enimy
With sturdie steps came stalking in his sight
An hideous Geant horrible and hye
That with his tallnesse seemd to threat the skye
The ground eke groned under him for dreed
His living like saw never living eye
Ne durst behold his stature did exceed
The hight of three the tallest sonnes of mortall seed
Brought forth this monstrous masse of earthly slime
Puft up with emptie wind and fild with sinfull crime
So growen great through arrogant delight
Of th' high descent whereof he was yborne
And through presumption of his matchlesse might
All other powres and knighthood he did scorne
Such now he marcheth to this man forlorne
And left to losse his stalking steps are stayde
Upon a snaggy Oke which he had torne
Out of his mothers bowelles and it made
His mortall mace wherewith his foeman he dismayde
That when the knight he spide he gan advance
With huge force and insupportable mayne
And towardes him with dreadfull fury praunce
Who haplesse and eke hopelesse all in vaine
Did to him pace sad battaile to darrayne
Disarmd disgrast and inwardly dismayde
And eke so faint in every joynt and vaine
Through that fraile fountaine which him feeble made
That scarsely could he weeld his bootlesse single blade
The Geaunt strooke so maynly mercilesse
That could have overthrowne a stony towre
And were not heavenly grace that did him blesse
He had beene pouldred all as thin as flowre
But he was wary of that deadly stowre
And lightly lept from underneath the blow
Yet so exceeding was the villeins powre
That with the wind it did him overthrow
And all his sences stound that still he lay full low
As when that divelish yron Engin wrought
In deepest Hell and framd by Furies skill
With windy Nitre and quick Sulphur fraught
And ramd with bullet round ordaind to kill
Conceiveth fire the heavens it doth fill
With thundring noyse and all the ayre doth choke
That none can breath nor see nor heare at will
Through smouldry cloud of duskish stincking smoke
That th' onely breath him daunts who hath escapt the stroke
So daunted when the Geaunt saw the knight
His heavie hand he heaved up on hye
And him to dust thought to have battred quight
Untill Duessa loud to him gan crye
O great Orgoglio greatest under skye
O hold thy mortall hand for Ladies sake
Hold for my sake and do him not to dye
But vanquisht thine eternall bondslave make
And me thy worthy meed unto thy Leman take
He hearkned and did stay from further harmes
To gayne so goodly guerdon as she spake
So willingly she came into his armes
Who her as willingly to grace did take
And was possessed of his new found make
Then up he tooke the slombred sencelesse corse
And ere he could out of his swowne awake
Him to his castle brought with hastie forse
And in a Dongeon deepe him threw without remorse
From that day forth Duessa was his deare
And highly honourd in his haughtie eye
He gave her gold and purple pall to weare
And triple crowne set on her head full hye
And her endowd with royall majestye
Then for to make her dreaded more of men
And peoples harts with awfull terrour tye
A monstrous beast ybred in filthy fen
He chose which he had kept long time in darksome den
Such one it was as that renowmed Snake
Which great Alcides in Stremona slew
Long fostred in the filth of Lerna lake
Whose many heads out budding ever new
Did breed him endlesse labour to subdew
But this same Monster much more ugly was
For seven great heads out of his body grew
An yron brest and back of scaly bras
And all embrewd in bloud his eyes did shine as glas
His tayle was stretched out in wondrous length
That to the house of heavenly gods it raught
And with extorted powre and borrow'd strength
The ever-burning lamps from thence it braught
And prowdly threw to ground as things of naught
And underneath his filthy feet did tread
The sacred things and holy heasts foretaught
Upon this dreadfull Beast with sevenfold head
He sett the false Duessa for more aw and dread
The wofull Dwarfe which saw his maisters fall
Whiles he had keeping of his grasing steed
And valiant knight become a caytive thrall
When all was past tooke up his forlorne weed
His mightie armour missing most at need
His silver shield now idle maisterlesse
His poynant speare that many made to bleed
The rueful moniments of heavinesse
And with them all departes to tell his great distresse
He had not travaild long when on the way
He wofull Ladie wofull Una met
Fast flying from that Paynims greedy pray
Whilest Satyrane him from pursuit did let
Who when her eyes she on the Dwarfe had set
And saw the signes that deadly tydings spake
She fell to ground for sorrowfull regret
And lively breath her sad brest did forsake
Yet might her pitteous hart be seene to pant and quake
The messenger of so unhappie newes
Would faine have dyde dead was his hart within
Yet outwardly some little comfort shewes
At last recovering hart he does begin
To rub her temples and to chaufe her chin
And everie tender part does tosse and turne
So hardly he the flitted life does win
Unto her native prison to retourne
Then gins her grieved ghost thus to lament and mourne
Ye dreary instruments of dolefull sight
That doe this deadly spectacle behold
Why do ye lenger feed on loathed light
Or liking find to gaze on earthly mould
Sith cruell fates the carefull threeds unfould
The which my life and love together tyde
Now let the stony dart of senselesse cold
Perce to my hart and pas through every side
And let eternall night so sad sight fro me hide
O lightsome day the lampe of highest Jove
First made by him mens wandring wayes to guyde
When darkenesse he in deepest dongeon drove
Henceforth thy hated face for ever hyde
And shut up heavens windowes shyning wyde
For earthly sight can nought but sorrow breed
And late repentance which shall long abyde
Mine eyes no more on vanitie shall feed
But seeled up with death shall have their deadly meed
Then downe againe she fell unto the ground
But he her quickly reared up againe
Thrise did she sinke adowne in deadly swownd
And thrise he her reviv'd with busie paine
At last when life recover'd had the raine
And over-wrestled his strong enemie
With foltring tong and trembling every vaine
Tell on quoth she the wofull Tragedie
The which these reliques sad present unto mine eie
Tempestuous fortune hath spent all her spight
And thrilling sorrow throwne his utmost dart
Thy sad tongue cannot tell more heavy plight
Then that I feele and harbour in mine hart
Who hath endur'd the whole can beare each part
If death it be it is not the first wound
That launched hath my brest with bleeding smart
Begin and end the bitter balefull stound
If lesse then that I feare more favour I have found
Then gan the Dwarfe the whole discourse declare
The subtill traines of Archimago old
The wanton loves of false Fidessa faire
Bought with the blood of vanquisht Paynim bold
The wretched payre transformed to treen mould
The house of Pride and perils round about
The combat which he with Sansjoy did hould
The lucklesse conflict with the Gyant stout
Wherein captiv'd of life or death he stood in doubt
She heard with patience all unto the end
And strove to maister sorrowfull assay
Which greater grew the more she did contend
And almost rent her tender hart in tway
And love fresh coles unto her fire did lay
For greater love the greater is the losse
Was never Lady loved dearer day
Then she did love the knight of the Redcrosse
For whose deare sake so many troubles her did tosse
At last when fervent sorrow slaked was
She up arose resolving him to find
Alive or dead and forward forth doth pas
All as the Dwarfe the way to her assynd
And evermore in constant carefull mind
She fed her wound with fresh renewed bale
Long tost with stormes and bet with bitter wind
High over hills and low adowne the dale
She wandred many a wood and measurd many a vale
At last she chaunced by good hap to meet
A goodly knight faire marching by the way
Together with his Squire arrayed meet
His glitterand armour shined farre away
Like glauncing light of Phoebus brightest ray
From top to toe no place appeared bare
That deadly dint of steele endanger may
Athwart his brest a bauldrick brave he ware
That shynd like twinkling stars with stons most pretious rare
And in the midst thereof one pretious stone
Of wondrous worth and eke of wondrous mights
Shapt like a Ladies head exceeding shone
Like Hesperus emongst the lesser lights
And strove for to amaze the weaker sights
Thereby his mortall blade full comely hong
In yvory sheath ycarv'd with curious slights
Whose hilts were burnisht gold and handle strong
Of mother pearle and buckled with a golden tong
His haughtie helmet horrid all with gold
Both glorious brightnesse and great terrour bred
For all the crest a Dragon did enfold
With greedie pawes and over all did spred
His golden wings his dreadfull hideous hed
Close couched on the bever seem'd to throw
From flaming mouth bright sparkles fierie red
That suddeine horror to faint harts did show
And scaly tayle was stretcht adowne his backe full low
Upon the top of all his loftie crest
A bunch of haires discolourd diversly
With sprincled pearle and gold full richly drest
Did shake and seemd to daunce for jollity
Like to an Almond tree ymounted hye
On top of greene Selinis all alone
With blossoms brave bedecked daintily
Whose tender locks do tremble every one
At every little breath that under heaven is blowne
His warlike shield all closely cover'd was
Ne might of mortall eye be ever seene
Not made of steele nor of enduring bras
Such earthly mettals soone consumed beene
But all of Diamond perfect pure and cleene
It framed was one massie entire mould
Hewen out of Adamant rocke with engines keene
That point of speare it never percen could
Ne dint of direfull sword divide the substance would
The same to wight he never wont disclose
But when as monsters huge he would dismay
Or daunt unequall armies of his foes
Or when the flying heavens he would affray
For so exceeding shone his glistring ray
That Phoebus golden face it did attaint
As when a cloud his beames doth over-lay
And silver Cynthia wexed pale and faint
As when her face is staynd with magicke arts constraint
No magicke arts hereof had any might
Nor bloudie wordes of bold Enchaunters call
But all that was not such as seemd in sight
Before that shield did fade and suddeine fall
And when him list the raskall routes appall
Men into stones therewith he could transmew
And stones to dust and dust to nought at all
And when him list the prouder lookes subdew
He would them gazing blind or turne to other hew
Ne let it seeme that credence this exceedes
For he that made the same was knowne right well
To have done much more admirable deedes
It Merlin was which whylome did excell
All living wightes in might of magicke spell
Both shield and sword and armour all he wrought
For this young Prince when first to armes he fell
But when he dyde the Faerie Queene it brought
To Faerie lond where yet it may be seene if sought
A gentle youth his dearely loved Squire
His speare of heben wood behind him bare
Whose harmefull head thrice heated in the fire
Had riven many a brest with pikehead square
A goodly person and could menage faire
His stubborne steed with curbed canon bit
Who under him did trample as the aire
And chauft that any on his backe should sit
The yron rowels into frothy fome he bit
When as this knight nigh to the Ladie drew
With lovely court he gan her entertaine
But when he heard her answeres loth he knew
Some secret sorrow did her heart distraine
Which to allay and calme her storming paine
Faire feeling words he wisely gan display
And for her humour fitting purpose faine
To tempt the cause it selfe for to bewray
Wherewith emmov'd these bleeding words she gan to say
What worlds delight or joy of living speach
Can heart so plung'd in sea of sorrowes deep
And heaped with so huge misfortunes reach
The carefull cold beginneth for to creepe
And in my heart his yron arrow steepe
Soone as I thinke upon my bitter bale
Such helplesse harmes yts better hidden keepe
Then rip up griefe where it may not availe
My last left comfort is my woes to weepe and waile
Ah Ladie deare quoth then the gentle knight
Well may I weene your griefe is wondrous great
For wondrous great griefe groneth in my spright
Whiles thus I heare you of your sorrowes treat
But wofull Ladie let me you intrete
For to unfold the anguish of your hart
Mishaps are maistred by advice discrete
And counsell mittigates the greatest smart
Found never helpe who never would his hurts impart
O but quoth she great griefe will not be tould
And can more easily be thought then said
Right so quoth he but he that never would
Could never will to might gives greatest aid
But griefe quoth she does greater grow displaid
If then it find not helpe and breedes despaire
Despaire breedes not quoth he where faith is staid
No faith so fast quoth she but flesh does paire
Flesh may empaire quoth he but reason can repaire
His goodly reason and well guided speach
So deepe did settle in her gracious thought
That her perswaded to disclose the breach
Which love and fortune in her heart had wrought
And said Faire Sir I hope good hap hath brought
You to inquire the secrets of my griefe
Or that your wisedome will direct my thought
Or that your prowesse can me yield reliefe
Then heare the storie sad which I shall tell you briefe
The forlorne Maiden whom your eyes have seene
The laughing stocke of fortunes mockeries
Am th' only daughter of a King and Queene
Whose parents deare whilest equal destinies
Did runne about and their felicities
The favourable heavens did not envy
Did spread their rule through all the territories
Which Phison and Euphrates floweth by
And Gehons golden waves doe wash continually
Till that their cruell cursed enemy
An huge great Dragon horrible in sight
Bred in the loathly lakes of Tartary
With murdrous ravine and devouring might
Their kingdome spoild and countrey wasted quight
Themselves for feare into his jawes to fall
He forst to castle strong to take their flight
Where fast embard in mighty brasen wall
He has them now foure yeres besiegd to make them thrall
Full many knights adventurous and stout
Have enterpriz'd that Monster to subdew
From every coast that heaven walks about
Have thither come the noble Martiall crew
That famous hard atchievements still pursew
Yet never any could that girlond win
But all still shronke and still he greater grew
All they for want of faith or guilt of sin
The pitteous pray of his fierce crueltie have bin
At last yledd with farre reported praise
Which flying fame throughout the world had spred
Of doughty knights whom Faery land did raise
That noble order hight of Maidenhed
Forthwith to court of Gloriane I sped
Of Gloriane great Queene of glory bright
Whose Kingdomes seat Cleopolis is red
There to obtaine some such redoubted knight
The Parents deare from tyrants powre deliver might
It was my chance my chance was faire and good
There for to find a fresh unproved knight
Whose manly hands imbrew'd in guiltie blood
Had never bene ne ever by his might
Had throwne to ground the unregarded right
Yet of his prowesse proofe he since hath made
I witnesse am in many a cruell fight
The groning ghosts of many one dismaide
Have felt the bitter dint of his avenging blade
And ye the forlorne reliques of his powre
His byting sword and his devouring speare
Which have endured many a dreadfull stowre
Can speake his prowesse that did earst you beare
And well could rule now he hath left you heare
To be the record of his ruefull losse
And of my dolefull disaventurous deare
O heavie record of the good Redcrosse
Where have you left your Lord that could so well you tosse
Well hoped I and faire beginnings had
That he my captive languor should redeeme
Till all unweeting an Enchaunter bad
His sence abusd and made him to misdeeme
My loyalty not such as it did seeme
That rather death desire then such despight
Be judge ye heavens that all things right esteeme
How I him lov'd and love with all my might
So thought I eke of him and thinke I thought aright
Thenceforth me desolate he quite forsooke
To wander where wilde fortune would me lead
And other bywaies he himselfe betooke
Where never foot of living wight did tread
That brought not backe the balefull body dead
In which him chaunced false Duessa meete
Mine onely foe mine onely deadly dread
Who with her witchcraft and misseeming sweete
Inveigled him to follow her desires unmeete
At last by subtill sleights she him betraid
Unto his foe a Gyant huge and tall
Who him disarmed dissolute dismaid
Unwares surprised and with mighty mall
The monster mercilesse him made to fall
Whose fall did never foe before behold
And now in darkesome dungeon wretched thrall
Remedilesse for aie he doth him hold
This is my cause of griefe more great then may be told
Ere she had ended all she gan to faint
But he her comforted and faire bespake
Certes Madame ye have great cause of plaint
The stoutest heart I weene could cause to quake
But be of cheare and comfort to you take
For till I have acquit your captive knight
Assure your selfe I will you not forsake
His chearefull wordes reviv'd her chearelesse spright
So forth they went the Dwarfe them guiding ever right
Ay me how many perils doe enfold
The righteous man to make him daily fall
Were not that heavenly grace doth him uphold
And stedfast truth acquite him out of all
Her love is firme her care continuall
So oft as he through his owne foolish pride
Or weaknesse is to sinfull bands made thrall
Else should this Redcrosse knight in bands have dydd
For whose deliverance she this Prince doth thither guide
They sadly traveild thus until they came
Nigh to a castle builded strong and hie
Then cryde the Dwarfe Lo yonder is the same
In which my Lord my liege doth lucklesse lie
Thrall to that Gyants hateful tyrannie
Therefore deare Sir your mightie powres assay
The noble knight alighted by and by
From loftie steede and bad the Ladie stay
To see what end of fight should him befall that day
So with the Squire th' admirer of his might
He marched forth towards that castle wall
Whose gates he found fast shut ne living wight
To ward the same nor answere commers call
Then tooke that Squire an horne of bugle small
Which hong adowne his side in twisted gold
And tassels gay Wyde wonders over all
Of that same hornes great vertues weren told
Which had approved bene in uses manifold
Was never wight that heard that shrilling sownd
But trembling feare did feel in every vaine
Three miles it might be easie heard around
And Ecchoes three answerd it selfe againe
No false enchauntment nor deceiptfull traine
Might once abide the terror of that blast
But presently was voide and wholly vaine
No gate so strong no locke so firme and fast
But with that percing noise flew open quite or brast
The same before the Geants gate he blew
That all the castle quaked from the ground
And every dore of freewill open flew
The Gyant selfe dismaied with that sownd
Where he with his Duessa dalliance fownd
In hast came rushing forth from inner bowre
With staring countenance sterne as one astownd
And staggering steps to weet what suddein stowre
Had wrought that horror strange and dar'd his dreaded powre
And after him the proud Duessa came
High mounted on her many-headed beast
And every head with fyrie tongue did flame
And every head was crowned on his creast
And bloody mouthed with late cruell feast
That when the knight beheld his mightie shild
Upon his manly arme he soone addrest
And at him fiercely flew with courage fild
And eger greedinesse through every member thrild
Therewith the Gyant buckled him to fight
Inflam'd with scornefull wrath and high disdaine
And lifting up his dreadfull club on hight
All arm'd with ragged snubbes and knottie graine
Him thought at first encounter to have slaine
But wise and wary was that noble Pere
And lightly leaping from so monstrous maine
Did faire avoide the violence him nere
It booted nought to thinke such thunderbolts to beare
Ne shame he thought to shunne so hideous might
The idle stroke enforcing furious way
Missing the marke of his misaymed sight
Did fall to ground and with his heavie sway
So deepely dinted in the driven clay
That three yardes deepe a furrow up did throw
The sad earth wounded with so sore assay
Did grone full grievous underneath the blow
And trembling with strange feare did like an earthquake show
As when almightie Jove in wrathfull mood
To wreake the guilt of mortall sins is bent
Hurles forth his thundring dart with deadly food
Enrold in flames and smouldring dreriment
Through riven cloudes and molten firmament
The fierce threeforked engin making way
Both loftie towres and highest trees hath rent
And all that might his angry passage stay
And shooting in the earth casts up a mount of clay
His boystrous club so buried in the ground
He could not rearen up againe so light
But that the knight him at avantage found
And whiles he strove his combred clubbe to quight
Out of the earth with blade all burning bright
He smote off his left arme which like a blocke
Did fall to ground depriv'd of native might
Large streames of bloud out of the truncked stocke
Forth gushed like fresh water streame from riven rocke
Dismayed with so desperate deadly wound
And eke impatient of unwonted paine
He lowdly brayd with beastly yelling sound
That all the fields rebellowed againe
As great a noyse as when in Cymbrian plaine
An heard of Bulles whom kindly rage doth sting
Do for the milkie mothers want complaine
And fill the fields with troublous bellowing
The neighbour woods around with hollow murmur ring
That when his deare Duessa heard and saw
The evil stownd that daungerd her estate
Unto his aide she hastily did draw
Her dreadfull beast who swolne with blood of late
Came ramping forth with proud presumpteous gate
And threatned all his heads like flaming brands
But him the Squire made quickly to retrate
Encountring fierce with single sword in hand
And twixt him and his Lord did like a bulwarke stand
The proud Duessa full of wrathfull spight
And fierce disdaine to be affronted so
Enforst her purple beast with all her might
That stop out of the way to overthroe
Scorning the let of so unequall foe
But nathemore would that courageous swayne
To her yeeld passage gainst his Lord to goe
But with outrageous strokes did him restraine
And with his bodie bard the way atwixt them twaine
Then tooke the angrie witch her golden cup
Which still she bore replete with magick artes
Death and despeyre did many thereof sup
And secret poyson through their inner parts
Th' eternall bale of heavie wounded harts
Which after charmes and some enchauntments said
She lightly sprinkled on his weaker parts
Therewith his sturdie courage soone was quayd
And all his senses were with suddeine dread dismayd
So downe he fell before the cruell beast
Who on his neck his bloody clawes did seize
That life nigh crusht out of his panting brest
No powre he had to stirre nor will to rize
That when the carefull knight gan well avise
He lightly left the foe with whom he fought
And to the beast gan turne his enterprise
For wondrous anguish in his hart it wrought
To see his loved Squire into such thraldome brought
And high advauncing his blood-thirstie blade
Stroke one of those deformed heads so sore
That of his puissance proud ensample made
His monstrous scalpe downe to his teeth it tore
And that misformed shape mis-shaped more
A sea of blood gusht from the gaping wound
That her gay garments staynd with filthy gore
And overflowed all the field around
That over shoes in bloud he waded on the ground
Thereat he roared for exceeding paine
That to have heard great horror would have bred
And scourging th' emptie ayre with his long traine
Through great impatience of his grieved hed
His gorgeous ryder from her loftie sted
Would have cast downe and trod in durtie myre
Had not the Gyant soone her succoured
Who all enrag'd with smart and franticke yre
Came hurtling in full fierce and forst the knight retyre
The force which wont in two to be disperst
In one alone left hand he now unites
Which is through rage more strong than both were erst
With which his hideous club aloft he dites
And at his foe with furious rigour smites
That strongest Oake might seeme to overthrow
The stroke upon his shield so heavie lites
That to the ground it doubleth him full low
What mortall wight could ever beare so monstrous blow
And in his fall his shield that covered was
Did loose his vele by chaunce and open flew
The light whereof that heavens light did pas
Such blazing brightnesse through the aier threw
That eye mote not the same endure to vew
Which when the Gyaunt spyde with staring eye
He downe let fall his arme and soft withdrew
His weapon huge that heaved was on hye
For to have slaine the man that on the ground did lye
And eke the fruitfull-headed beast amazd
At flashing beames of that sunshiny shield
Became starke blind and all his sences daz'd
That downe he tumbled on the durtie field
And seem'd himselfe as conquered to yield
Whom when his maistresse proud perceiv'd to fall
Whiles yet his feeble feet for faintnesse reeld
Unto the Gyant loudly she gan call
O helpe Orgoglio helpe or else we perish all
At her so pitteous cry was much amoov'd
Her champion stout and for to ayde his frend
Againe his wonted angry weapon proov'd
But all in vaine for he has read his end
In that bright shield and all their forces spend
Themselves in vaine for since that glauncing sight
He had no powre to hurt nor to defend
As where th' Almighties lightning brond does light
It dimmes the dazed eyen and daunts the senses quight
Whom when the Prince to battell new addrest
And threatning high his dreadfull stroke did see
His sparkling blade about his head he blest
And smote off quite his right leg by the knee
That downe he tombled as an aged tree
High growing on the top of rocky clift
Whose hartstrings with keene steele nigh hewen be
The mightie trunck halfe rent with ragged rift
Doth roll adowne the rocks and fall with fearefull drift
Or as a Castle reared high and round
By subtile engins and malitious slight
Is undermined from the lowest ground
And her foundation forst and feebled quight
At last downe falles and with her heaped hight
Her hastie ruine does more heavie make
And yields it selfe unto the victours might
Such was this Gyants fall that seemd to shake
The stedfast globe of earth as it for feare did quake
The knight then lightly leaping to the pray
With mortall steele him smot againe so sore
That headlesse his unweldy bodie lay
All wallowd in his owne fowle bloudy gore
Which flowed from his wounds in wondrous store
But soone as breath out of his breast did pas
That huge great body which the Gyaunt bore
Was vanisht quite and of that monstrous mas
Was nothing left but like an emptie bladder was
Whose grievous fall when false Duessa spide
Her golden cup she cast unto the ground
And crowned mitre rudely threw aside
Such percing griefe her stubborne hart did wound
That she could not endure that dolefull stound
But leaving all behind her fled away
The light-foot Squire her quickly turnd around
And by hard meanes enforcing her to stay
So brought unto his Lord as his deserved pray
The royall Virgin which beheld from farre
In pensive plight and sad perplexitie
The whole atchievement of this doubtfull warre
Came running fast to greet his victorie
With sober gladnesse and myld modestie
And with sweet joyous cheare him thus bespake
Faire braunch of noblesse flowre of chevalrie
That with your worth the world amazed make
How shall I quite the paines ye suffer for my sake
And you fresh budd of vertue springing fast
Whom these sad eyes saw nigh unto deaths dore
What hath poore Virgin for such perill past
Wherewith you to reward Accept therefore
My simple selfe and service evermore
And he that high does sit and all things see
With equall eyes their merites to restore
Behold what ye this day have done for mee
And what I cannot quite requite with usuree
But sith the heavens and your faire handeling
Have made you master of the field this day
Your fortune maister eke with governing
And well begun end all so well I pray
Ne let that wicked woman scape away
For she it is that did my Lord bethrall
My dearest Lord and deepe in dongeon lay
Where he his better dayes hath wasted all
O heare how piteous he to you for ayd does call
Forthwith he gave in charge unto his Squire
That scarlot whore to keepen carefully
Whiles he himselfe with greedie great desire
Into the Castle entred forcibly
Where living creature none he did espye
Then gan he lowdly through the house to call
But no man car'd to answere to his crye
There raignd a solemne silence over all
Nor voice was heard nor wight was seene in bowre or hall
At last with creeping crooked pace forth came
An old old man with beard as white as snow
That on a staffe his feeble steps did frame
And guide his wearie gate both to and fro
For his eye sight him failed long ygo
And on his arme a bounch of keyes he bore
The which unused rust did overgrow
Those were the keyes of every inner dore
But he could not them use but kept them still in store
But very uncouth sight was to behold
How he did fashion his untoward pace
For as he forward moov'd his footing old
So backward still was turnd his wrincled face
Unlike to men who ever as they trace
Both feet and face one way are wont to lead
This was the auncient keeper of that place
And foster father of the Gyant dead
His name Ignaro did his nature right aread
His reverend haires and holy gravitie
The knight much honord as beseemed well
And gently askt where all the people bee
Which in that stately building wont to dwell
Who answerd him full soft he could not tell
Again he askt where that same knight was layd
Whom great Orgoglio with his puissance fell
Had made his caytive thrall againe he sayde
He could not tell ne ever other answere made
Then asked he which way he in might pas
He could not tell againe he answered
Thereat the curteous knight displeased was
And said Old sire it seemes thou hast not red
How ill it sits with that same silver hed
In vaine to mocke or mockt in vaine to bee
But if thou be as thou art pourtrahed
With natures pen in ages grave degree
Aread in graver wise what I demaund of thee
His answere likewise was he could not tell
Whose sencelesse speach and doted ignorance
When as the noble Prince had marked well
He ghest his nature by his countenance
And calmd his wrath with goodly temperance
Then to him stepping from his arme did reach
Those keyes and made himselfe free enterance
Each dore he opened without any breach
There was no barre to stop nor foe him to empeach
There all within full rich arrayd he found
With royall arras and resplendent gold
And did with store of every thing abound
That greatest Princes presence might behold
But all the floore too filthy to be told
With bloud of guiltlesse babes and innocents trew
Which there were slaine as sheepe out of the fold
Defiled was that dreadfull was to vew
And sacred ashes over it was strowed new
And there beside of marble stone was built
An Altare carv'd with cunning ymagery
On which true Christians bloud was often spilt
And holy Martyrs often doen to dye
With cruell malice and strong tyranny
Whose blessed sprites from underneath the stone
To God for vengeance cryde continually
And with great griefe were often heard to grone
That hardest heart would bleede to hear their piteous mone
Through every rowme he sought and every bowr
But no where could he find that woful thrall
At last he came unto an yron doore
That fast was lockt but key found not at all
Emongst that bounch to open it withall
But in the same a little grate was pight
Through which he sent his voyce and lowd did call
With all his powre to weet if living wight
Were housed there within whom he enlargen might
Therewith an hollow dreary murmuring voyce
These pitteous plaints and dolours did resound
O who is that which brings me happy choyce
Of death that here lye dying every stound
Yet live perforce in balefull darkenesse bound
For now three Moones have changed thrice their hew
And have been thrice hid underneath the ground
Since I the heavens chearfull face did vew
O welcome thou that doest of death bring tydings trew
Which when that Champion heard with percing point
Of pitty deare his hart was thrilled sore
And trembling horrour ran through every joynt
For ruth of gentle knight so fowle forlore
Which shaking off he rent that yron dore
With furious force and indignation fell
Where entred in his foot could find no flore
But all a deepe descent as darke as hell
That breathed ever forth a filthie banefull smell
But neither darkenesse fowle nor filthy bands
Nor noyous smell his purpose could withhold
Entire affection hateth nicer hands
But that with constant zeale and courage bold
After long paines and labours manifold
He found the meanes that Prisoner up to reare
Whose feeble thighes unhable to uphold
His pined corse him scarse to light could beare
A ruefull spectacle of death and ghastly drere
His sad dull eyes deepe sunck in hollow pits
Could not endure th' unwonted sunne to view
His bare thin cheekes for want of better bits
And empty sides deceived of their dew
Could make a stony hart his hap to rew
His rawbone armes whose mighty brawned bowrs
Were wont to rive steele plates and helmets hew
Were cleane consum'd and all his vitall powres
Decayd and all his flesh shronk up like withered flowres
Whom when his Lady saw to him she ran
With hasty joy to see him made her glad
And sad to view his visage pale and wan
Who earst in flowres of freshest youth was clad
Tho when her well of teares she wasted had
She said Ah dearest Lord what evill starre
On you hath fround and pourd his influence bad
That of your selfe ye thus berobbed arre
And this misseeming hew your manly looks doth marre
But welcome now my Lord in wele or woe
Whose presence I have lackt too long a day
And fie on Fortune mine avowed foe
Whose wrathful wreakes them selves doe now alay
And for these wrongs shall treble penaunce pay
Of treble good good growes of evils priefe
The chearelesse man whom sorrow did dismay
Had no delight to treaten of his griefe
His long endured famine needed more reliefe
Faire Lady then said that victorious knight
The things that grievous were to do or beare
Them to renew I wote breeds no delight
Best musicke breeds delight in loathing eare
But th' onely good that growes of passed feare
Is to be wise and ware of like agein
This dayes ensample hath this lesson deare
Deepe written in my heart with yron pen
That blisse may not abide in state of mortall men
Henceforth sir knight take to you wonted strength
And maister these mishaps with patient might
Loe where your foe lyes stretcht in monstrous length
And loe that wicked woman in your sight
The roote of all your care and wretched plight
Now in your powre to let her live or dye
To do her dye quoth Una were despight
And shame t'avenge so weake an enimy
But spoile her of her scarlot robe and let her fly
So as she bad that witch they disaraid
And robd of royall robes and purple pall
And ornaments that richly were displaid
Ne spared they to strip her naked all
Then when they had despoiled her tire and call
Such as she was their eyes might her behold
That her misshaped parts did them appall
A loathly wrinckled hag ill favoured old
Whose secret filth good manners biddeth not be told
Which when the knights beheld amazd they were
And wondred at so fowle deformed wight
Such then said Una as she seemeth here
Such is the face of falshood such the sight
Of fowle Duessa when her borrowed light
Is laid away and counterfesaunce knowne
Thus when they had the witch disrobed quight
And all her filthy feature open showne
They let her goe at will and wander wayes unknowne
She flying fast from heavens hated face
And from the world that her discovered wide
Fled to the wastfull wildernesse apace
From living eyes her open shame to hide
And lurkt in rocks and caves long unespide
But that faire crew of knights and Una faire
Did in that castle afterwards abide
To rest them selves and weary powres repaire
Where store they found of all that dainty was and rare
O goodly golden chaine wherewith yfere
The vertues linked are in lovely wize
And noble mindes of yore allyed were
In brave poursuit of chevalrous emprize
That none did others safety despize
Nor aid envy to him in need that stands
But friendly each did others prayse devize
How to advaunce with favourable hands
As this good Prince redeemd the Redcrosse knight from bands
Who when their powres empaird through labour long
With dew repast they had recured well
And that weake captive wight now wexed strong
Them list no lenger there at leasure dwell
But forward fare as their adventures fell
But ere they parted Una faire besought
That straunger knight his name and nation tell
Least so great good as he for her had wrought
Should die unknown and buried be in thanklesse thought
Faire virgin said the Prince ye me require
A thing without the compas of my wit
For both the lignage and the certain Sire
From which I sprong from me are hidden yit
For all so soone as life did me admit
Into this world and shewed heavens light
From mothers pap I taken was unfit
And streight deliver'd to a Faery knight
To be upbrought in gentle thewes and martiall might
Unto old Timon he me brought bylive
Old Timon who in youthly yeares hath beene
In warlike feates th'  man alive
And is the wisest now on earth I weene
His dwelling is low in a valley greene
Under the foot of Rauran mossy hore
From whence the river Dee as silver cleene
His tombling billowes roll with gentle rore
There all my dayes he traind me up in vertuous lore
Thither the great magicien Merlin came
As was his use ofttimes to visit me
For he had charge my discipline to frame
And Tutours nouriture to oversee
Him oft and oft I askt in privitie
Of what loines and what lignage I did spring
Whose aunswere bad me still assured bee
That I was sonne and heire unto a king
As time in her just terme the truth to light should bring
Well worthy impe said then the Lady gent
And pupill fit for such a Tutours hand
But what adventure or what high intent
Hath brought you hither into Faery land
Aread Prince Arthur crowne of Martiall band
Full hard it is quoth he to read aright
The course of heavenly cause or understand
The secret meaning of th' eternall might
That rules mens wayes and rules the thoughts of living wight
For whether he through fatall deepe foresight
Me hither sent for cause to me unghest
Or that fresh bleeding wound which day and night
Whilome doth rancle in my riven brest
With forced fury following his behest
Me hither brought by wayes yet never found
You to have helpt I hold myself yet blest
Ah curteous knight quoth she what secret wound
Could ever find to grieve the gentlest hart on ground
Deare dame quoth he you sleeping sparkes awake
Which troubled once into huge flames will grow
Ne ever will their fervent fury slake
Till living moysture into smoke do flow
And wasted life do lye in ashes low
Yet sithens silence lesseneth not my fire
But told it flames and hidden it does glow
I will revele what ye so much desire
Ah Love lay down thy bow the whiles I may respire
It was in freshest flowre of youthly yeares
When courage first does creepe in manly chest
Then first the coale of kindly heat appeares
To kindle love in every living brest
But me had warnd old Timons wise behest
Those creeping flames by reason to subdew
Before their rage grew to so great unrest
As miserable lovers use to rew
Which still wex old in woe whiles woe still wexeth new
That idle name of love and lovers life
As losse of time and vertues enimy
I ever scornd and joyd to stirre up strife
In middest of their mournfull Tragedy
Ay wont to laugh when them I heard to cry
And blow the fire which them to ashes brent
Their God himselfe griev'd at my libertie
Shot many a dart at me with fiers intent
But I them warded all with wary government
But all in vaine no fort can be so strong
Ne fleshly brest can armed be so sound
But will at last be wonne with battrie long
Or unawares at disadvantage found
Nothing is sure that growes on earthly ground
And who most trustes in arme of fleshly might
And boasts in beauties chaine not to be bound
Doth soonest fall in disaventrous fight
And yeeldes his caytive neck to victours most despight
Ensample make of him your haplesse joy
And of my selfe now mated as ye see
Whose prouder vaunt that proud avenging boy
Did soone pluck downe and curbd my libertie
For on a day prickt forth with jollitie
Of looser life and heat of hardiment
Raunging the forest wide on courser free
The fields the floods the heavens with one consent
Did seeme to laugh on me and favour mine intent
For-wearied with my sports I did alight
From loftie steed and downe to sleepe me layd
The verdant gras my couch did goodly dight
And pillow was my helmet faire displayd
Whiles every sence the humour sweet embayd
And slombring soft my hart did steale away
Me seemed by my side a royall Mayd
Her daintie limbes full softly down did lay
So faire a creature yet saw never sunny day
Most goodly glee and lovely blandishment
She to me made and bad me love her deare
For dearely sure her love was to me bent
As when just time expired should appeare
But whether dreames delude or true it were
Was never hart so ravisht with delight
Ne living man like words did ever heare
As she to me delivered all that night
And at her parting said She Queene of Faeries hight
When I awoke and found her place devoyd
And nought but pressed gras where she had lyen
I sorrowed all so much as earst I joyd
And washed all her place with watry eyen
From that day forth I lov'd that face divine
From that day forth I cast in carefull mind
To seeke her out with labour and long tyne
And never vowd to rest till her I find
Nine monethes I seeke in vain yet ni'll that vow unbind
Thus as he spake his visage wexed pale
And chaunge of hew great passion did bewray
Yet still he strove to cloke his inward bale
And hide the smoke that did his fire display
Till gentle Una thus to him gan say
O happy Queene of Faeries that has found
Mongst many one that with his prowesse may
Defend thine honour and thy foes confound
True Loves are often sown but seldom grow on ground
Thine O then said the gentle Recrosse knight
Next to that Ladies love shal be the place
O fairest virgin full of heavenly light
Whose wondrous faith exceeding earthly race
Was firmest fixt in mine extremest case
And you my Lord the Patrone of my life
Of that great Queene may well gaine worthy grace
For onely worthy you through prowes priefe
Yf living man mote worthie be to be her liefe
So diversly discoursing of their loves
The golden Sunne his glistring head gan shew
And sad remembraunce now the Prince amoves
With fresh desire his voyage to pursew
Als Una earnd her traveill to renew
Then those two knights fast friendship for to bynd
And love establish each to other trew
Gave goodly gifts the signes of gratefull mynd
And eke the pledges firme right hands together joynd
Prince Arthur gave a boxe of Diamond sure
Embowd with gold and gorgeous ornament
Wherein were closd few drops of liquor pure
Of wondrous worth and vertue excellent
That any wound could heale incontinent
Which to requite the Redcrosse knight him gave
A booke wherein his Saveours testament
Was writ with golden letters rich and brave
A worke of wondrous grace and able soules to save
Thus beene they parted Arthur on his way
To seeke his love and th' other for to fight
With Unaes foe that all her realme did pray
But she now weighing the decayed plight
And shrunken synewes of her chosen knight
Would not a while her forward course pursew
Ne bring him forth in face of dreadfull fight
Till he recovered had his former hew
For him to be yet weake and wearie well she knew
So as they traveild lo they gan espy
An armed knight towards them gallop fast
That seemed from some feared foe to fly
Or other griesly thing that him aghast
Still as he fled his eye was backward cast
As if his feare still followed him behind
Als flew his steed as he his bands had brast
And with his winged heeles did tread the wind
As he had beene a fole of Pegasus his kind
Nigh as he drew they might perceive his head
To be unarmd and curld uncombed heares
Upstaring stiffe dismayd with uncouth dread
Nor drop of bloud in all his face appeares
Nor life in limbe and to increase his feares
In fowle reproch of knighthoods faire degree
About his neck an hempen rope he weares
That with his glistring armes does ill agree
But he of rope or armes has now no memoree
The Redcrosse knight toward him crossed fast
To weet what mister wight was so dismayd
There him he finds all sencelesse and aghast
That of him selfe he seemd to be afrayd
Whom hardly he from flying forward stayd
Till he these wordes to him deliver might
Sir knight aread who hath ye thus arayd
And eke from whom make ye this hasty flight
For never knight I saw in such misseeming plight
He answerd nought at all but adding new
Feare to his first amazment staring wide
With stony eyes and hartlesse hollow hew
Astonisht stood as one that had aspide
Infernall furies with their chaines untide
Him yet againe and yet againe bespake
The gentle knight who nought to him replide
But trembling every joint did inly quake
And foltring tongue at last these words seemd forth to shake
For Gods deare love Sir knight do me not stay
For loe he comes he comes fast after mee
Eft looking back would faine have runne away
But he him forst to stay and tellen free
The secret cause of his perplexitie
Yet nathemore by his bold hartie speach
Could his bloud-frosen hart emboldned bee
But through his boldnesse rather feare did reach
Yet forst at last he made through silence suddein breach
And am I now in safetie sure quoth he
From him that would have forced me to dye
And is the point of death now turnd fro mee
That I may tell this haplesse history
Feare nought quoth he no daunger now is nye
Then shall I you recount a ruefull cace
Said he the which with this unlucky eye
I late beheld and had not greater grace
Me reft from it had bene partaker of the place
I lately chaunst would I had never chaunst
With a faire knight to keepen companee
Sir Terwin hight that well himselfe advaunst
In all affaires and was both bold and free
But not so happy as mote happy bee
He lov'd as was his lot a Ladie gent
That him againe lov'd in the least degree
For she was proud and of too high intent
And joyd to see her lover languish and lament
From whom returning sad and comfortlesse
As on the way together we did fare
We met that villen God from him me blesse
That cursed wight from whom I scapt whyleare
A man of hell that cals himselfe Despaire
Who first us greets and after faire areedes
Of tydings strange and of adventures rare
So creeping close as Snake in hidden weedes
Inquireth of our states and of our knightly deedes
Which when he knew and felt our feeble harts
Embost with bale and bitter byting griefe
Which love had launched with his deadly darts
With wounding words and termes of foule repriefe
He pluckt from us all hope of due reliefe
That earst us held in love of lingring life
Then hopelesse hartlesse gan the cunning thiefe
Perswade us die to stint all further strife
To me he lent this rope to him a rustie knife
With which sad instrument of hasty death
That wofull lover loathing lenger light
A wide way made to let forth living breath
But I more fearfull or more luckie wight
Dismayd with that deformed dismall sight
Fled fast away halfe dead with dying feare
Ne yet assur'd of life by you Sir knight
Whose like infirmitie like chaunce may beare
But God you never let his charmed speeches heare
How may a man said he with idle speach
Be wonne to spoyle the Castle of his health
I wote quoth he whom triall late did teach
That like would not for all this worldes wealth
His subtill tongue like dropping honny mealt'h
Into the hart and searcheth every vaine
That ere one be aware by secret stealth
His powre is reft and weaknesse doth remaine
O never Sir desire to try his guilefull traine
Certes said he hence shall I never rest
Till I that treacherours art have heard and tride
And you Sir knight whose name mote I request
Of grace do me unto his cabin guide
I that hight Trevisan quoth he will ride
Against my liking backe to do you grace
But not for gold nor glee will I abide
By you when ye arrive in that same place
For lever had I die then see his deadly face
Ere long they come where that same wicked wight
His dwelling has low in an hollow cave
Farre underneath a craggie clift ypight
Darke dolefull drearie like a greedy grave
That still for carrion carcases doth crave
On top whereof aye dwelt the ghastly Owle
Shrieking his balefull note which ever drave
Far from that haunt all other chearefull fowle
And all about it wandring ghostes did waile and howle
And all about old stockes and stubs of trees
Whereon nor fruit nor leafe was ever seene
Did hang upon the ragged rocky knees
On which had many wretches hanged beene
Whose carcases were scattered on the greene
And throwne about the clifts Arrived there
That bare-head knight for dread and dolefull teene
Would faine have fled ne durst approchen neare
But th' other forst him stay and comforted in feare
That darkesome cave they enter where they find
That cursed man low sitting on the ground
Musing full sadly in his sullein mind
His griesie lockes long growen and unbound
Disordred hong about his shoulders round
And hid his face through which his hollow eyne
Lookt deadly dull and stared as astound
His raw-bone cheekes through penurie and pine
Were shronke into his jawes as he did never dine
His garment nought but many ragged clouts
With thornes together pind and patched was
The which his naked sides he wrapt abouts
And him beside there lay upon the gras
A drearie corse whose life away did pas
All wallowed in his owne yet luke-warme blood
That from his wound yet welled fresh alas
In which a rustie knife fast fixed stood
And made an open passage for the gushing flood
Which piteous spectacle approving trew
The wofull tale that Trevisan had told
When as the gentle Redcrosse knight did vew
With firie zeale he burnt in courage bold
Him to avenge before his bloud were cold
And to the villein said Thou damned wight
The author of this fact we here behold
What justice can but judge against thee right
With thine owne bloud to price his bloud here shed in sight
What franticke fit quoth he hath thus distraught
Thee foolish man so rash a doome to give
What justice ever other judgement taught
But he should die who merites not to live
None else to death this man despayring drive
But his owne guiltie mind deserving death
Is then unjust to each his due to give
Or let him die that loatheth living breath
Or let him die at ease that liveth here uneath
Who travels by the wearie wandring way
To come unto his wished home in haste
And meetes a flood that doth his passage stay
Is not great grace to helpe him over past
Or free his feet that in the myre sticke fast
Most envious man that grieves at neighbours good
And fond that joyest in the woe thou hast
Why wilt not let him passe that long hath stood
Upon the banke yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood
He there does now enjoy eternall rest
And happy ease which thou dost want and crave
And further from it daily wanderest
What if some little paine the passage have
That makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter wave
Is not short paine well borne that brings long ease
And layes the soule to sleepe in quiet grave
Sleepe after toyle port after stormie seas
Ease after warre death after life does greatly please
The knight much wondred at his suddeine wit
And said The terme of life is limited
Ne may a man prolong nor shorten it
The souldier may not move from watchfull sted
Nor leave his stand untill his Captaine bed
Who life did limit by almightie doome
Quoth he knowes best the termes established
And he that points the Centonell his roome
Doth license him depart at sound of morning droome
Is not his deed what ever thing is donne
In heaven and earth did not he all create
To die againe all ends that was begonne
Their times in his eternall booke of fate
Are written sure and have their certaine date
Who then can strive with strong necessitie
That holds the world in his still chaunging state
Or shunne the death ordaynd by destinie
When houre of death is come let none aske whence nor why
The lenger life I wote the greater sin
The greater sin the greater punishment
All those great battels which thou boasts to win
Through strife and blood-shed and avengement
Now praysd hereafter deare thou shalt repent
For life must life and blood must blood repay
Is not enough thy evill life forespent
For he that once hath missed the right way
The further he doth goe the further he doth stray
Then do no further goe no further stray
But here lie downe and to thy rest betake
Th' ill to prevent that life ensewen may
For what hath life that may it loved make
And gives not rather cause it to forsake
Feare sicknesse age losse labour sorrow strife
Paine hunger cold that makes the hart to quake
And ever fickle fortune rageth rife
All which and thousands mo do make a loathsome life
Thou wretched man of death hast greatest need
If in true ballance thou wilt weigh thy state
For never knight that dared warlike deede
More lucklesse disaventures did amate
Witnesse the dungeon deepe wherein of late
Thy life shut up for death so oft did call
And though good lucke prolonged hath thy date
Yet death then would the like mishaps forestall
Into the which hereafter thou maiest happen fall
Why then doest thou O man of sin desire
To draw thy dayes forth to their last degree
Is not the measure of thy sinfull hire
High heaped up with huge iniquitie
Against the day of wrath to burden thee
Is not enough that to this Ladie milde
Thou falsed hast thy faith with perjurie
And sold thy selfe to serve Duessa vilde
With whom in all abuse thou hast thy selfe defilde
Is not he just that all this doth behold
From highest heaven and beares an equall eye
Shall he thy sins up in his knowledge fold
And guilty be of thine impietie
Is not his law Let every sinner die
Die shall all flesh what then must needs be donne
Is it not better to doe willinglie
Then linger till the glasse be all out ronne
Death is the end of woes die soone O faeries sonne
The knight was much enmoved with his speach
That as a swords point through his hart did perse
And in his conscience made a secret breach
Well knowing true all that he did reherse
And to his fresh remembraunce did reverse
The ugly vew of his deformed crimes
That all his manly powres it did disperse
As he were charmed with inchaunted rimes
That oftentimes he quakt and fainted oftentimes
In which amazement when the Miscreant
Perceived him to waver weake and fraile
Whiles trembling horror did his conscience dant
And hellish anguish did his soule assaile
To drive him to despaire and quite to quaile
He shew'd him painted in a table plaine
The damned ghosts that doe in torments waile
And thousand feends that doe them endlesse paine
With fire and brimstone which for ever shall remaine
The sight whereof so throughly him dismaid
That nought but death before his eyes he saw
And ever burning wrath before him laid
By righteous sentence of th' Almighties law
Then gan the villein him to overcraw
And brought unto him swords ropes poison fire
And all that might him to perdition draw
And bad him choose what death he would desire
For death was due to him that had provokt Gods ire
But when as none of them he saw him take
He to him raught a dagger sharpe and keene
And gave it him in hand his hand did quake
And tremble like a leafe of Aspin greene
And troubled bloud through his pale face was seene
To come and goe with tidings from the heart
As it a running messenger had beene
At last resolv'd to worke his finall smart
He lifted up his hand that backe againe did start
Which whenas Una saw through every vaine
The crudled cold ran to her well of life
As in a swowne but soone reliv'd againe
Out of his hand she snatcht the cursed knife
And threw it to the ground enraged rife
And to him said Fie fie faint harted knight
What meanest thou by this reprochfull strife
Is this the battell which thou vauntst to fight
With that fire-mouthed Dragon horrible and bright
Come come away fraile seely fleshly wight
Ne let vaine words bewitch thy manly hart
Ne divelish thoughts dismay thy constant spright
In heavenly mercies hast thou not a part
Why shouldst thou then despeire that chosen art
Where justice growes there grows eke greater grace
The which doth quench the brond of hellish smart
And that accurst hand-writing doth deface
Arise Sir knight arise and leave this cursed place
So up he rose and thence amounted streight
Which when the carle beheld and saw his guest
Would safe depart for all his subtill sleight
He chose an halter from among the rest
And with it hung himselfe unbid unblest
But death he could not worke himselfe thereby
For thousand times he so himselfe had drest
Yet nathelesse it could not doe him die
Till he should die his last that is eternally
What man is he that boasts of fleshly might
And vaine assurance of mortality
Which all so soone as it doth come to fight
Against spirituall foes yeelds by and by
Or from the field most cowardly doth fly
Ne let the man ascribe it to his skill
That thorough grace hath gained victory
If any strength we have it is to ill
But all the good is Gods both power and eke will
But that which lately hapned Una saw
That this her knight was feeble and too faint
And all his sinews woxen weake and raw
Through long enprisonment and hard constraint
Which he endured in his late restraint
That yet he was unfit for bloudy fight
Therefore to cherish him with diets daint
She cast to bring him where he chearen might
Till he recovered had his late decayed plight
There was an auntient house not farre away
Renowmd throughout the world for sacred lore
And pure unspotted life so well they say
It governd was and guided evermore
Through wisedome of a matrone grave and hore
Whose onely joy was to relieve the needes
Of wretched soules and helpe the helpelesse pore
All night she spent in bidding of her bedes
And all the day in doing good and godly deedes
Dame Coelia men did her call as thought
From heaven to come or thither to arise
The mother of three daughters well upbrought
In goodly thewes and godly exercise
The eldest two most sober chast and wise
Fidelia and Speranza virgins were
Though spousd yet wanting wedlocks solemnize
But faire Charissa to a lovely fere
Was lincked and by him had many pledges dere
Arrived there the dore they find fast lockt
For it was warely watched night and day
For feare of many foes but when they knockt
The Porter opened unto them streight way
He was an aged syre all hory gray
With lookes full lowly cast and gate full slow
Wont on a staffe his feeble steps to stay
Hight Humilta They passe in stouping low
For streight and narrow was the way which he did show
Each goodly thing is hardest to begin
But entred in a spacious court they see
Both plaine and pleasant to be walked in
Where them does meete a francklin faire and free
And entertaines with comely courteous glee
His name was Zele that him right well became
For in his speeches and behaviour hee
Did labour lively to expresse the same
And gladly did them guide till to the Hall they came
There fairely them receives a gentle Squire
Of milde demeanure and rare courtesie
Right cleanly clad in comely sad attire
In word and deede that shew'd great modestie
And knew his good to all of each degree
Hight Reverence He them with speeches meet
Does faire entreat no courting nicetie
But simple true and eke unfained sweet
As might become a Squire so great persons to greet
And afterwards them to his Dame he leades
That aged Dame the Ladie of the place
Who all this while was busy at her beades
Which doen she up arose with seemely grace
And toward them full matronely did pace
Where when that fairest Una she beheld
Whom well she knew to spring from heavenly race
Her hart with joy unwonted inly sweld
As feeling wondrous comfort in her weaker eld
And her embracing said O happie earth
Whereon thy innocent feet doe ever tread
Most vertuous virgin borne of heavenly berth
That to redeeme thy woefull parents head
From tyrans rage and ever dying dread
Hast wandred through the world now long a day
Yet ceasest not thy weary soles to lead
What grace hath thee now hither brought this way
Or doen thy feeble feet unweeting hither stray
Strange thing it is an errant knight to see
Here in this place or any other wight
That hither turnes his steps So few there bee
That chose the narrow path or seeke the right
All keepe the broad high way and take delight
With many rather for to go astray
And be partakers of their evill plight
Then with a few to walke the rightest way
O foolish men why haste ye to your owne decay
Thy selfe to see and tyred limbes to rest
O matrone sage quoth she I hither came
And this good knight his way with me addrest
Led with thy prayses and broad-blazed fame
That up to heaven is blowne The auncient Dame
Him goodly greeted in her modest guise
And entertaynd them both as best became
With all the court'sies that she could devise
Ne wanted ought to shew her bounteous or wise
Thus as they gan of sundry things devise
Loe two most goodly virgins came in place
Ylinked arme in arme in lovely wise
With countenance demure and modest grace
They numbred even steps and equall pace
Of which the eldest that Fidelia hight
Like sunny beames threw from her christall face
That could have dazd the rash beholders sight
And round about her head did shine like heavens light
She was araied all in lilly white
And in her right hand bore a cup of gold
With wine and water fild up to the hight
In which a Serpent did himselfe enfold
That horrour made to all that did behold
But she no whit did chaunge her constant mood
And in her other hand she fast did hold
A booke that was both signd and seald with blood
Wherin darke things were writ hard to be understood
Her younger sister that Speranza hight
Was clad in blew that her beseemed well
Not all so chearefull seemed she of sight
As was her sister whether dread did dwell
Or anguish in her hart is hard to tell
Upon her arme a silver anchor lay
Whereon she leaned ever as befell
And ever up to heaven as she did pray
Her stedfast eyes were bent ne swarved other way
They seeing Una towards her gan wend
Who them encounters with like courtesie
Many kind speeches they betwene them spend
And greatly joy each other well to see
Then to the knight with shamefast modestie
They turne themselves at Unaes meeke request
And him salute with well beseeming glee
Who faire them quites as him beseemed best
And goodly gan discourse of many a noble gest
Then Una thus But she your sister deare
The deare Charissa where is she become
Or wants she health or busie is elsewhere
Ah no said they but forth she may not come
For she of late is lightned of her wombe
And hath encreast the world with one sonne more
That her to see should be but troublesome
Indeed quoth she that should be trouble sore
But thankt be God and her encrease so evermore
Then said the aged Coelia Deare dame
And you good Sir I wote that of youre toyle
And labours long through which ye hither came
Ye both forwearied be therefore a whyle
I read you rest and to your bowres recoyle
Then called she a Groome that forth him led
Into a goodly lodge and gan despoile
Of puissant armes and laid in easie bed
His name was meeke Obedience rightfully ared
Now when their wearie limbes with kindly rest
And bodies were refresht with due repast
Faire Una gan Fidelia faire request
To have her knight into her schoolehouse plaste
That of her heavenly learning he might taste
And heare the wisedom of her words divine
She graunted and that knight so much agraste
That she him taught celestiall discipline
And opened his dull eyes that light mote in them shine
And that her sacred Booke with blood ywrit
That none could read except she did them teach
She unto him disclosed every whit
And heavenly documents thereout did preach
That weaker wit of man could never reach
Of God of grace of justice of free will
That wonder was to heare her goodly speach
For she was able with her words to kill
And raise againe to life the hart that she did thrill
And when she list poure out her larger spright
She would commaund the hastie Sunne to stay
Or backward turne his course from heavens hight
Sometimes great hostes of men she could dismay
Dry-shod to passe she parts the flouds in tway
And eke huge mountaines from their native seat
She would commaund themselves to beare away
And throw in raging sea with roaring threat
Almightie God her gave such powre and puissaunce great
The faithfull knight now grew in litle space
By hearing her and by her sisters lore
To such perfection of all heavenly grace
That wretched world he gan for to abhore
And mortall life gan loath as thing forlore
Greevd with remembrance of his wicked wayes
And prickt with anguish of his sinnes so sore
That he desirde to end his wretched dayes
So much the dart of sinfull guilt the soule dismayes
But wise Speranza gave him comfort sweet
And taught him how to take assured hold
Upon her silver anchor as was meet
Else had his sinnes so great and manifold
Made him forget all that Fidelia told
In this distressed doubtfull agonie
When him his dearest Una did behold
Disdeining life desiring leave to die
She found her selfe assayld with great perplexitie
And came to Coelia to declare her smart
Who well acquainted with that commune plight
Which sinfull horror workes in wounded hart
Her wisely comforted all that she might
With goodly counsell and advisement right
And streightway sent with carefull diligence
To fetch a Leach the which had great insight
In that disease of grieved conscience
And well could cure the same his name was Patience
Who comming to that soule-diseased knight
Could hardly him intreat to tell his griefe
Which knowne and all that noyd his heavie spright
Well searcht eftsoones he gan apply relief
Of salves and med'cines which had passing priefe
And thereto added words of wondrous might
By which to ease he him recured briefe
And much aswag'd the passion of his plight
That he his paine endur'd as seeming now more light
But yet the cause and root of all his ill
Inward corruption and infected sin
Not purg'd nor heald behind remained still
And festring sore did rankle yet within
Close creeping twixt the marrow and the skin
Which to extirpe he laid him privily
Downe in a darkesome lowly place farre in
Whereas he meant his corrosives to apply
And with streight diet tame his stubborne malady
In ashes and sackcloth he did array
His daintie corse proud humors to abate
And dieted with fasting every day
The swelling of his wounds to mitigate
And made him pray both earely and eke late
And ever as superfluous flesh did rot
Amendment readie still at hand did wayt
To pluck it out with pincers firie whot
That soone in him was left no one corrupted jot
And bitter Penance with an yron whip
Was wont him once to disple every day
And sharpe Remorse his hart did pricke and nip
That drops of blood thence like a well did play
And sad Repentance used to embay
His bodie in salt water smarting sore
The filthy blots of sinne to wash away
So in short space they did to health restore
The man that would not live but earst lay at deathes dore
In which his torment often was so great
That like a Lyon he would cry and rore
And rend his flesh and his owne synewes eat
His owne deare Una hearing evermore
His ruefull shriekes and gronings often tore
Her guiltlesse garments and her golden heare
For pitty of his paine and anguish sore
Yet all with patience wisely she did beare
For well she wist his crime could else be never cleare
Whom thus recover'd by wise Patience
And trew Repentaunce they to Una brought
Who joyous of his cured conscience
Him dearely kist and fairely eke besought
Himselfe to chearish and consuming thought
To put away out of his carefull brest
By this Charissa late in child-bed brought
Was woxen strong and left her fruitfull nest
To her faire Una brought this unacquainted guest
She was a woman in her freshest age
Of wondrous beauty and of bountie rare
With goodly grace and comely personage
That was on earth not easie to compare
Full of great love but Cupid wanton snare
As hell she hated chast in worke and will
Her necke and breasts were ever open bare
That ay thereof her babes might sucke their fill
The rest was all in yellow robes arayed still
A multitude of babes about her hong
Playing their sports that joyd her to behold
Whom still she fed whiles they were weake and young
But thrust them forth still as they wexed old
And on her head she wore a tyre of gold
Adornd with gemmes and owches wondrous faire
Whose passing price uneath was to be told
And by her side there sate a gentle paire
Of turtle doves she sitting in an yvorie chaire
The knight and Una entring faire her greet
And bid her joy of that her happie brood
Who them requites with court'sies seeming meet
And entertaines with friendly chearefull mood
Then Una her besought to be so good
As in her vertuous rules to schoole her knight
Now after all his torment well withstood
In that sad house of Penaunce where his spright
Had past the paines of hell and long enduring night
She was right joyous of her just request
And taking by the hand that Faeries sonne
Gan him instruct in every good behest
Of love and righteousnesse and well to donne
And wrath and hatred warely to shonne
That drew on men Gods hatred and his wrath
And many soules in dolours had fordonne
In which when him she well instructed hath
From thence to heaven she teacheth him the ready path
Wherein his weaker wandring steps to guide
An auncient matrone she to her does call
Whose sober lookes her wisedome well descride
Her name was Mercie well knowne over all
To be both gratious and eke liberall
To whom the carefull charge of him she gave
To lead aright that he should never fall
In all his wayes through this wide worldes wave
That Mercy in the end his righteous soule might save
The godly Matrone by the hand him beares
Forth from her presence by a narrow way
Scattred with bushy thornes and ragged breares
Which still before him she remov'd away
That nothing might his ready passage stay
And ever when his feet encombred were
Or gan to shrinke or from the right to stray
She held him fast and firmely did upbeare
As carefull Nourse her child from falling oft does reare
Eftsoones unto an holy Hospitall
That was fore by the way she did him bring
In which seven Bead-men that had vowed all
Their life to service of high heavens king
Did spend their dayes in doing godly thing
Their gates to all were open evermore
That by the wearie way were traveiling
And one sate wayting ever them before
To call in commers by that needy were and pore
The first of them that eldest was and best
Of all the house had charge and governement
As Guardian and Steward of the rest
His office was to give entertainement
And lodging unto all that came and went
Not unto such as could him feast againe
And double quite for that he on them spent
But such as want of harbour did constraine
Those for Gods sake his dewty was to entertaine
The second was as Almner of the place
His office was the hungry for to feed
And thristy give to drinke a worke of grace
He feard not once him selfe to be in need
Ne car'd to hoord for those whom he did breede
The grace of God he layd up still in store
Which as a stocke he left unto his seede
He had enough what need him care for more
And had he lesse yet some he would give to the pore
The third had of their wardrobe custodie
In which were not rich tyres nor garments gay
The plumes of pride and wings of vanitie
But clothes meet to keepe keene could away
And naked nature seemely to aray
With which bare wretched wights he dayly clad
The images of God in earthly clay
And if that no spare cloths to give he had
His owne coate he would cut and it distribute glad
The fourth appointed by his office was
Poore prisoners to relieve with gratious ayd
And captives to redeeme with price of bras
From Turkes and Sarazins which them had stayd
And though they faultie were yet well he wayd
That God to us forgiveth every howre
Much more then that why they in bands were layd
And he that harrowd hell with heavie stowre
The faultie soules from thence brought to his heavenly bowre
The fift had charge sicke persons to attend
And comfort those in point of death which lay
For them most needeth comfort in the end
When sin and hell and death do most dismay
The feeble soule departing hence away
All is but lost that living we bestow
If not well ended at our dying day
O man have mind of that last bitter throw
For as the tree does fall so lyes it ever low
The sixt had charge of them now being dead
In seemely sort their corses to engrave
And deck with dainty flowres their bridall bed
That to their heavenly spouse both sweet and brave
They might appeare when he their soules shall save
The wondrous workmanship of Gods owne mould
Whose face he made all beasts to feare and gave
All in his hand even dead we honour should
Ah dearest God me graunt I dead be not defould
The seventh now after death and buriall done
Had charge the tender orphans of the dead
And widowes ayd least they should be undone
In face of judgement he their right would plead
Ne ought the powre of mighty men did dread
In their defence nor would for gold or fee
Be wonne their rightfull causes downe to tread
And when they stood in most necessitee
He did supply their want and gave them ever free
There when the Elfin knight arrived was
The first and chiefest of the seven whose care
Was guests to welcome towardes him did pas
Where seeing Mercie that his steps upbare
And alwayes led to her with reverence rare
He humbly louted in meeke lowlinesse
And seemely welcome for her did prepare
For of their order she was Patronesse
Albe Charissa were their chiefest founderesse
There she awhile him stayes him selfe to rest
That to the rest more able he might bee
During which time in every good behest
And godly worke of almes and charitee
She him instructed with great industree
Shortly therein so perfect he became
That from the first unto the last degree
His mortall life he learned had to frame
In holy righteousnesse without rebuke or blame
Thence forward by that painfull way they pas
Forth to an hill that was both steepe and hy
On top whereof a sacred chappell was
And eke a little Hermitage thereby
Wherein an aged holy man did lye
That day and night said his devotion
Ne other worldly busines did apply
His name was heavenly Contemplation
Of God and goodnesse was his meditation
Great grace that old man to him given had
For God he often saw from heavens hight
All were his earthly eyen both blunt and bad
And through great age had lost their kindly sight
Yet wondrous quick and persant was his spright
As Eagles eye that can behold the Sunne
That hill they scale with all their powre and might
That his fraile thighes nigh weary and fordonne
Gan faile but by her helpe the top at last he wonne
There they do finde that godly aged Sire
With snowy lockes adowne his shoulders shed
As hoarie frost with spangles doth attire
The mossy braunches of an Oke halfe ded
Each bone might through his body well be red
And every sinew seene through his long fast
For nought he car'd his carcas long unfed
His mind was full of spirituall repast
And pyn'd his flesh to keepe his body low and chast
Who when these two approaching he aspide
At their first presence grew agrieved sore
That forst him lay his heavenly thoughts aside
And had he not that Dame respected more
Whom highly he did reverence and adore
He would not once have moved for the knight
They him saluted standing far afore
Who well them greeting humbly did requight
And asked to what end they clomb that tedious height
What end quoth she should cause us take such paine
But that same end which every living wight
Should make his marke high heaven to attaine
Is not from hence the way that leadeth right
To that most glorious house that glistreth bright
With burning starres and everliving fire
Whereof the keyes are to thy hand behight
By wise Fidelia She doth thee require
To show it to his knight according his desire
Thrise happy man said then the father grave
Whose staggering steps thy steady hand doth lead
And shewes the way his sinfull soule to save
Who better can the way to heaven aread
Then thou thy selfe that was both borne and bred
In heavenly throne where thousand Angels shine
Thou doest the prayers of the righteous sead
Present before the majestie divine
And his avenging wrath to clemencie incline
Yet since thou bidst thy pleasure shal be donne
Then come thou man of earth and see the way
That never yet was seene of Faeries sonne
That never leads the traveiler astray
But after labors long and sad delay
Brings them to joyous rest and endlesse blis
But first thou must a season fast and pray
Till from her bands the spright assoiled is
And have her strength recur'd from fraile infirmitis
That donne he leads him to the highest Mount
Such one as that same mighty man of God
That blood-red billowes like a walled front
On either side disparted with his rod
Till that his army dry-foot through them yod
Dwelt forty dayes upon where writ in stone
With bloudy letters by the hand of God
The bitter doome of death and balefull mone
He did receive whiles flashing fire about him shone
Or like that sacred hill whose head full hie
Adornd with fruitfull Olives all arownd
Is as it were for endlesse memory
Of that deare Lord who oft thereon was fownd
For ever with a flowring girlond crownd
Or like that pleasaunt Mount that is for ay
Through famous Poets verse each where renownd
On which the thrise three learned Ladies play
Their heavenly notes and make full many a lovely lay
From thence far off he unto him did shew
A litle path that was both steepe and long
Which to a goodly Citie led his vew
Whose wals and towres were builded high and strong
Of perle and precious stone that earthly tong
Cannot describe nor wit of man can tell
Too high a ditty for my simple song
The Citie of the great king hight it well
Wherein eternall peace and happinesse doth dwell
As he thereon stood gazing he might see
The blessed Angels to and fro descend
From highest heaven in gladsome companee
And with great joy into that Citie wend
As commonly as friend does with his frend
Whereat he wondred much and gan enquere
What stately building durst so high extend
Her loftie towres unto the starry sphere
And what unknowen nation there empeopled were
Faire knight quoth he Hierusalem that is
The new Hierusalem that God has built
For those to dwell in that are chosen his
His chosen people purg'd from sinfull guilt
With pretious blood which cruelly was spilt
On cursed tree of that unspotted lam
That for the sinnes of al the world was kilt
Now are they Saints all in that Citie sam
More dear unto their God then younglings to their dam
Till now said then the knight I weened well
That great Cleopolis where I have beene
In which that fairest Faerie Queene doth dwell
The fairest citie was that might be seene
And that bright towre all built of christall cleene
Panthea seemd the brightest thing that was
But now by proofe all otherwise I weene
For this great Citie that does far surpas
And this bright Angels towre quite dims that towre of glas
Most trew then said the holy aged man
Yet is Cleopolis for earthly frame
The fairest peece that eye beholden can
And well beseemes all knights of noble name
That covett in th' immortall booke of fame
To be eternized that same to haunt
And doen their service to that soveraigne dame
That glorie does to them for guerdon graunt
For she is heavenly borne and heaven may justly vaunt
And thou faire ymp sprong out from English race
How ever now accompted Elfins sonne
Well worthy doest thy service for her grace
To aide a virgin desolate fordonne
But when thou famous victory hast wonne
And high emongst all knights hast hong thy shield
Thenceforth the suit of earthly conquest shonne
And wash thy hands from guilt of bloudy field
For blood can nought but sin and wars but sorrowes yield
Then seek this path that I to thee presage
Which after all to heaven shall thee send
Then peaceably thy painefull pilgrimage
To yonder same Hierusalem do bend
Where is for thee ordaind a blessed end
For thou emongst those Saints whom thou doest see
Shall be a Saint and thine owne nations frend
And Patrone thou Saint George shalt called bee
Saint George of mery England the signe of victoree
Unworthy wretch quoth he of so great grace
How dare I thinke such glory to attaine
These that have it attaind were in like cace
Quoth he as wretched and liv'd in like paine
But deeds of armes must I at last be faine
And Ladies love to leave so dearely bought
What need of armes where peace doth ay remaine
Said he and battailes none are to be fought
As for loose loves they're vain and vanish into nought
O let me not quoth he then turne againe
Backe to the world whose joyes so fruitlesse are
But let me here for aye in peace remaine
Or streight way on that last long voyage fare
That nothing may my present hope empare
That may not be said he ne maist thou yit
Forgo that royall maides bequeathed care
Who did her cause into thy hand commit
Till from her cursed foe thou have her freely quit
Then shall I soone quoth he so God me grace
Abet that virgins cause disconsolate
And shortly backe returne unto this place
To walke this way in Pilgrims poore estate
But now aread old father why of late
Didst thou behight me borne of English blood
Whom all a Faeries sonne doen nominate
That word shall I said he avouchen good
Sith to thee is unknowne the cradle of thy blood
For well I wote thou springst from ancient race
Of Saxon kings that have with mightie hand
And many bloody battailes fought in place
High reard their royall throne in Britane land
And vanquisht them unable to withstand
From thence a Faerie thee unweeting reft
There as thou slepst in tender swadling band
And her base Elfin brood there for thee left
Such men do Chaungelings call so chang'd by Faeries theft
Thence she thee brought into this Faerie lond
And in an heaped furrow did thee hyde
Where thee a Ploughman all unweeting fond
As he his toylesome teme that way did guyde
And brought thee up in ploughmans state to byde
Whereof Georgos he gave thee to name
Till prickt with courage and thy forces pryde
To Faerie court thou cam'st to seeke for fame
And prove thy puissaunt armes as seemes thee best became
O holy Sire quoth he how shall I quight
The many favours I with thee have found
That hast my name and nation red aright
And taught the way that does to heaven bound
This said adowne he looked to the ground
To have returnd but dazed were his eyne
Through passing brightnesse which did quite confound
His feeble sence and too exceeding shyne
So darke are earthly things compard to things divine
At last whenas himselfe he gan to find
To Una back he cast him to retire
Who him awaited still with pensive mind
Great thankes and goodly meed to that good syre
He thence departing gave for his paines hyre
So came to Una who him joyd to see
And after little rest gan him desire
Of her adventure mindfull for to bee
So leave they take of Coelia and her daughters three
High time now gan it wex for Una faire
To thinke of those her captive Parents deare
And their forwasted kingdome to repaire
Whereto whenas they now approched neare
With hartie wordes her knight she gan to cheare
And in her modest manner thus bespake
Deare knight as deare as ever knight was deare
That all these sorrowes suffer for my sake
High heaven behold the tedious toyle ye for me take
Now are we come unto my native soyle
And to the place where all our perils dwell
Here haunts that feend and does his dayly spoyle
Therefore henceforth be at your keeping well
And ever ready for your foeman fell
The sparke of noble courage now awake
And strive your excellent selfe to excell
That shall ye evermore renowmed make
Above all knights on earth that batteill undertake
And pointing forth Lo yonder is said she
The brasen towre in which my parents deare
For dread of that huge feend emprisond be
Whom I from far see on the walles appeare
Whose sight my feeble soule doth greatly cheare
And on the top of all I do espye
The watchman wayting tydings glad to heare
That O my parents might I happily
Unto you bring to ease you of your misery
With that they heard a roaring hideous sound
That all the ayre with terrour filled wide
And seemd uneath to shake the stedfast ground
Eftsoones that dreadful Dragon they espide
Where stretcht he lay upon the sunny side
Of a great hill himselfe like a great hill
But all so soone as he from far descride
Those glistring armes that heaven with light did fill
He rousd himselfe full blith and hastned them untill
Then bad the knight his Lady yede aloofe
And to an hill her selfe withdraw aside
From whence she might behold that battailles proof
And eke be safe from daunger far descryde
She him obayd and turnd a little wyde
Now O thou sacred muse most learned Dame
Faire ympe of Phoebus and his aged bride
The Nourse of time and everlasting fame
That warlike hands ennoblest with immortall name
O gently come into my feeble brest
Come gently but not with that mighty rage
Wherewith the martiall troupes thou doest infest
And harts of great Heroes doest enrage
That nought their kindled courage may aswage
Soone as thy dreadfull trompe begins to sownd
The God of warre with his fiers equipage
Thou doest awake sleepe never he so sownd
All scared nations doest with horrour sterne astownd
Faire Goddesse lay that furious fit aside
Till I of warres and bloody Mars do sing
And Briton fields with Sarazin bloud bedyde
Twixt that great Faery Queene and Paynim king
That with their horrour heaven and earth did ring
A worke of labour long and endlesse prayse
But now a while let downe that haughtie string
And to my tunes thy second tenor rayse
That I this man of God his godly armes may blaze
By this the dreadfull Beast drew nigh to hand
Halfe flying and halfe footing in his haste
That with his largenesse measured much land
And made wide shadow under his huge wast
As mountaine doth the valley overcast
Approching nigh he reared high afore
His body monstrous horrible and vaste
Which to increase his wondrous greatnesse more
Was swoln with wrath and poyson and with bloudy gore
And over all with brasen scales was armd
Like plated coate of steele so couched neare
That nought mote perce ne might his corse be harmd
With dint of sword nor push of pointed speare
Which as an Eagle seeing pray appeare
His aery plumes doth rouze full rudely dight
So shaked he that horrour was to heare
For as the clashing of an Armour bright
Such noyse his rouzed scales did send unto the knight
His flaggy wings when forth he did display
Were like two sayles in which the hollow wynd
Is gathered full and worketh speedy way
And eke the pennes that did his pineons bynd
Were like mayne-yards with flying canvas lynd
With which whenas him list the ayre to beat
And there by force unwonted passage find
The cloudes before him fled for terrour great
And all the heavens stood still amazed with his threat
His huge long tayle wound up in hundred foldes
Does overspred his long bras-scaly backe
Whose wreathed boughts when ever he unfoldes
And thicke entangled knots adown does slacke
Bespotted as with shields of red and blacke
It sweepeth all the land behind him farre
And of three furlongs does but litle lacke
And at the point two stings in-fixed arre
Both deadly sharpe that sharpest steele exceeden farre
But stings and sharpest steele did far exceed
The sharpnesse of his cruell rending clawes
Dead was it sure as sure as death in deed
What ever thing does touch his ravenous pawes
Or what within his reach he ever drawes
But his most hideous head my toung to tell
Does tremble for his deepe devouring jawes
Wide gaped like the griesly mouth of hell
Through which into his darke abisse all ravin fell
And that more wondrous was in either jaw
Three ranckes of yron teeth enraunged were
In which yet trickling blood and gobbets raw
Of late devoured bodies did appeare
That sight thereof bred cold congealed feare
Which to increase and as atonce to kill
A cloud of smoothering smoke and sulphure seare
Out of his stinking gorge forth steemed still
That all the ayre about with smoke and stench did fill
His blazing eyes like two bright shining shields
Did burne with wrath and sparkled living fyre
As two broad Beacons set in open fields
Send forth their flames far off to every shyre
And warning give that enemies conspyre
With fire and sword the region to invade
So flam'd his eyne with rage and rancorous yre
But farre within as in a hollow glade
Those glaring lampes were set that made a dreadfull shade
So dreadfully he towards him did pas
Forelifting up aloft his speckled brest
And often bounding on the brused gras
As for great joyance of his newcome guest
Eftsoones he gan advance his haughtie crest
As chauffed Bore his bristles doth upreare
And shoke his scales to battell ready drest
That made the Redcrosse knight nigh quake for feare
As bidding bold defiance to his foeman neare
The knight gan fairely couch his steadie speare
And fiercely ran at him with rigorous might
The pointed steele arriving rudely theare
His harder hide would neither perce nor bight
But glauncing by forth passed forward right
Yet sore amoved with so puissaunt push
The wrathfull beast about him turned light
And him so rudely passing by did brush
With his long tayle that horse and man to ground did rush
Both horse and man up lightly rose againe
And fresh encounter towards him addrest
But th'  stroke yet backe recoyld in vaine
And found no place his deadly point to rest
Exceeding rage enflam'd the furious beast
To be avenged of so great despight
For never felt his imperceable brest
So wondrous force from hand of living wight
Yet had he prov'd the powre of many a puissant knight
Then with his waving wings displayed wyde
Himselfe up high he lifted from the ground
And with strong flight did forcibly divide
The yielding aire which nigh too feeble found
Her flitting parts and element unsound
To beare so great a weight he cutting way
With his broad sayles about him soared round
At last low stouping with unweldie sway
Snatcht up both horse and man to beare them quite away
Long he them bore above the subject plaine
So far as Ewghen bow a shaft may send
Till struggling strong did him at last constraine
To let them downe before his flightes end
As hagard hauke presuming to contend
With hardie fowle above his hable might
His wearie pounces all in vaine doth spend
To trusse the pray too heavy for his flight
Which comming downe to ground does free it selfe by fight
He so disseized of his gryping grosse
The knight his thrillant speare again assayd
In his bras-plated body to embosse
And three mens strength unto the stroke he layd
Wherewith the stiffe beame quaked as affrayd
And glauncing from his scaly necke did glyde
Close under his left wing then broad displayd
The percing steele there wrought a wound full wyde
That with the uncouth smart the Monster lowdly cryde
He cryde as raging seas are wont to rore
When wintry storme his wrathfull wreck does threat
The roaring billowes beat the ragged shore
As they the earth would shoulder from her seat
And greedy gulfe does gape as he would eat
His neighbour element in his revenge
Then gin the blustring brethren boldly threat
To move the world from off his steadfast henge
And boystrous battell make each other to avenge
The steely head stucke fast still in his flesh
Till with his cruell clawes he snatcht the wood
And quite a sunder broke Forth flowed fresh
A gushing river of blacke goarie blood
That drowned all the land whereon he stood
The streame thereof would drive a water-mill
Trebly augmented was his furious mood
With bitter sence of his deepe rooted ill
That flames of fire he threw forth from his large nosethrill
His hideous tayle then hurled he about
And therewith all enwrapt the nimble thyes
Of his froth-fomy steed whose courage stout
Striving to loose the knot that fast him tyes
Himselfe in streighter bandes too rash implyes
That to the ground he is perforce constraynd
To throw his rider who can quickly ryse
From off the earth with durty blood distaynd
For that reprochfull fall right fowly he disdaynd
And fiercely tooke his trenchand blade in hand
With which he stroke so furious and so fell
That nothing seemd the puissaunce could withstand
Upon his crest the hardned yron fell
But his more hardned crest was armd so well
That deeper dint therein it would not make
Yet so extremely did the buffe him quell
That from thenceforth he shund the like to take
But when he saw them come he did them still forsake
The knight was wroth to see his stroke beguyld
And smote againe with more outrageous might
But backe againe the sparckling steele recoyld
And left not any marke where it did light
As if in Adamant rocke it had bene pight
The beast impatient of his smarting wound
And of so fierce and forcible despight
Thought with his wings to stye above the ground
But his late wounded wing unserviceable found
Then full of griefe and anguish vehement
He lowdly brayd that like was never heard
And from his wide devouring oven sent
A flake of fire that flashing in his beard
Him all amazd and almost made affeard
The scorching flame sore swinged all his face
And through his armour all his body seard
That he could not endure so cruell cace
But thought his armes to leave and helmet to unlace
Not that great Champion of the antique world
Whom famous Poetes verse so much doth vaunt
And hath for twelve huge labours high extold
So many furies and sharpe fits did haunt
When him the poysond garment did enchaunt
With Centaures bloud and bloudie verses charm'd
As did this knight twelve thousand dolours daunt
Whom fyrie steele now burnt that earst him arm'd
That erst him goodly arm'd now most of all him harm'd
Faint wearie sore emboyled grieved brent
With heat toyle wounds armes smart and inward fire
That never man such mischiefes did torment
Death better were death did he oft desire
But death will never come when needes require
Whom so dismayd when that his foe beheld
He cast to suffer him no more respire
But gan his sturdy sterne about to weld
And him so strongly stroke that to the ground him feld
It fortuned as faire it then befell
Behind his backe unweeting where he stood
Of auncient time there was a springing well
From which fast trickled forth a silver flood
Full of great vertues and for med'cine good
Whylome before that cursed Dragon got
That happy land and all with innocent blood
Defyld those sacred waves it rightly hot
The well of life ne yet his vertues had forgot
For unto life the dead it could restore
And guilt of sinfull crimes cleane wash away
Those that with sicknesse were infected sore
It could recure and aged long decay
Renew as one were borne that very day
Both Silo this and Jordan did excell
And th' English Bath and eke the German Spau
Ne can Cephise nor Hebrus match this well
Into the same the knight back overthrowen fell
Now gan the golden Phoebus for to steepe
His fierie face in billowes of the west
And his faint steedes watred in Ocean deepe
Whiles from their journall labours they did rest
When that infernall Monster having kest
His wearie foe into that living well
Can high advance his broad discoloured brest
Above his wonted pitch with countenance fell
And clapt his yron wings as victor he did dwell
Which when his pensive Ladie saw from farre
Great woe and sorrow did her soule assay
As weening that the sad end of the warre
And gan to highest God entirely pray
That feared chance from her to turne away
With folded hands and knees full lowly bent
All night she watcht ne once adowne would lay
Her daintie limbs in her sad dreriment
But praying still did wake and waking did lament
The morrow next gan early to appeare
That Titan rose to runne his daily race
But early ere the morrow next gan reare
Out of the sea faire Titans deawy face
Up rose the gentle virgin from her place
And looked all about if she might spy
Her loved knight to move his manly pace
For she had great doubt of his safety
Since late she saw him fall before his enemy
At last she saw where he upstarted brave
Out of the well wherein he drenched lay
As Eagle fresh out of the Ocean wave
Where he hath left his plumes all hoary gray
And deckt himselfe with feathers youthly gay
Like Eyas hauke up mounts unto the skies
His newly budded pineons to assay
And marveiles at himselfe still as he flies
So new this new-borne knight to battell new did rise
Whom when the damned feend so fresh did spy
No wonder if he wondred at the sight
And doubted whether his late enemy
It were or other new supplied knight
He now to prove his late renewed might
High brandishing his bright deaw-burning blade
Upon his crested scalpe so sore did smite
That to the scull a yawning wound it made
The deadly dint his dulled senses all dismaid
I wote not whether the revenging steele
Were hardned with that holy water dew
Wherein he fell or sharper edge did feele
Or his baptized hands now greater grew
Or other secret vertue did ensew
Else never could the force of fleshly arme
Ne molten mettall in his blood embrew
For till that stownd could never wight him harme
By subtilty nor slight nor might nor mighty charme
The cruell wound enraged him so sore
That loud he yelded for exceeding paine
As hundred ramping Lyons seem'd to rore
Whom ravenous hunger did thereto constraine
Then gan he tosse aloft his stretched traine
And therewith scourge the buxome aire so sore
That to his force to yeelden it was faine
Ne ought his sturdy strokes might stand afore
That high trees overthrew and rocks in peeces tore
The same advauncing high above his head
With sharpe intended sting so rude him smot
That to the earth him drove as stricken dead
Ne living wight would have him life behot
The mortall sting his angry needle shot
Quite through his shield and in his shoulder seasd
Where fast it stucke ne would there out be got
The griefe thereof him wondrous sore diseasd
Ne might his ranckling paine with patience be appeasd
But yet more mindfull of his honour deare
Then of the grievous smart which him did wring
From loathed soile he can him lightly reare
And strove to loose the far infixed sting
Which when in vaine he tryde with struggeling
Inflam'd with wrath his raging blade he heft
And strooke so strongly that the knotty string
Of his huge taile he quite a sunder cleft
Five joints thereof he hewd and but the stump him left
Hart cannot thinke what outrage and what cryes
With foule enfouldred smoake and flashing fire
The hell-bred beast threw forth unto the skyes
That all was covered with darkenesse dire
Then fraught with rancour and engorged ire
He cast at once him to avenge for all
And gathering up himselfe out of the mire
With his uneven wings did fiercely fall
Upon his sunne-bright shield and gript it fast withall
Much was the man encombred with his hold
In feare to lose his weapon in his paw
Ne wist yet how his talaunts to unfold
For harder was from Cerberus greedy jaw
To plucke a bone then from his cruell claw
To reave by strength the griped gage away
Thrise he assayd it from his foot to draw
And thrise in vaine to draw it did assay
It booted nought to thinke to robbe him of his pray
Tho when he saw no power might prevaile
His trustie sword he cald to his last aid
Wherewith he fiercely did his foe assaile
And double blowes about him stoutly laid
That glauncing fire out of the yron plaid
As sparckles from the Andvile use to fly
When heavy hammers on the wedge are swaid
Therewith at last he forst him to unty
One of his grasping feete him to defend thereby
The other foot fast fixed on his shield
Whenas no strength nor stroks mote him constraine
To loose ne yet the warlike pledge to yield
He smot thereat with all his might and maine
That nought so wondrous puissaunce might sustaine
Upon the joint the lucky steele did light
And made such way that hewd it quite in twaine
The paw yett missed not his minisht might
But hong still on the shield as it at first was pight
For griefe thereof and divelish despight
From his infernall fournace forth he threw
Huge flames that dimmed all the heavens light
Enrold in duskish smoke and brimstone blew
As burning Aetna from his boyling stew
Doth belch out flames and rockes in peeces broke
And ragged ribs of mountains molten new
Enwrapt in coleblacke clouds and filthy smoke
That all the land with stench and heaven with horror choke
The heate whereof and harmefull pestilence
So sore him noyd that forst him to retire
A little backward for his best defence
To save his body from the scorching fire
Which he from hellish entrailes did expire
It chaunst eternall God that chaunce did guide
As he recoiled backward in the mire
His nigh forwearied feeble feet did slide
And downe he fell with dread of shame sore terrifide
There grew a goodly tree him faire beside
Loaden with fruit and apples rosie red
As they in pure vermilion had beene dide
Whereof great vertues over all were red
For happy life to all which thereon fed
And life eke everlasting did befall
Great God it planted in that blessed sted
With his Almighty hand and did it call
The tree of life the crime of our first fathers fall
In all the world like was not to be found
Save in that soile where all good things did grow
And freely sprong out of the fruitfull ground
As incorrupted Nature did them sow
Till that dread Dragon all did overthrow
Another like faire tree eke grew thereby
Whereof whoso did eat eftsoones did know
Both good and ill O mornefull memory
That tree through one mans fault hath doen us all to dy
From that first tree forth flowd as from a well
A trickling streame of Balme most soveraine
And dainty deare which on the ground still fell
And overflowed all the fertile plaine
As it had deawed bene with timely raine
Life and long health that gratious ointment gave
And deadly wounds could heale and reare againe
The senselesse corse appointed for the grave
Into that same he fell which did from death him save
For nigh thereto the ever damned beast
Durst not approch for he was deadly made
And all that life preserved did detest
Yet he is oft adventur'd to invade
By this the drouping day-light gan to fade
And yield his roome to sad succeeding night
Who with her sable mantle gan to shade
The face of earth and wayes of living wight
And high her burning torch set up in heaven bright
When gentle Una saw the second fall
Of her deare knight who wearie of long fight
And faint through losse of blood mov'd not at all
But lay as in a dreame of deepe delight
Besmeard with pretious Balme whose vertuous might
Did heale his wounds and scorching heat alay
Againe she stricken was with sore affright
And for his safetie gan devoutly pray
And watch the noyous night and wait for joyous day
The joyous day gan early to appeare
And faire Aurora from the deawy bed
Of aged Tithone gan herselfe to reare
With rosy cheekes for shame as blushing red
Her golden locks for haste were loosely shed
About her eares when Una her did marke
Clymbe to her charet all with flowers spred
From heaven high to chase the chearelesse darke
With merry note her loud salutes the mounting larke
Then freshly up arose the doughtie knight
All healed of his hurts and woundes wide
And did himselfe to battell ready dight
Whose early foe awaiting him beside
To have devourd so soone as day he spyde
When now he saw himselfe so freshly reare
As if late fight had nought him damnifyde
He woxe dismayd and gan his fate to feare
Nathlesse with wonted rage he him advaunced neare
And in his first encounter gaping wide
He thought attonce him to have swallowd quight
And rusht upon him with outragious pride
Who him r'encountring fierce as hauke in flight
Perforce rebutted backe The weapon bright
Taking advantage of his open jaw
Ran through his mouth with so importune might
That deepe emperst his darksome hollow maw
And back retyrd his life blood forth with all did draw
So downe he fell and forth his life did breath
That vanisht into smoke and cloudes swift
So downe he fell that th' earth him underneath
Did grone as feeble so great load to lift
So downe he fell as an huge rockie clift
Whose false foundation waves have washt away
With dreadfull poyse is from the mayneland rift
And rolling downe great Neptune doth dismay
So downe he fell and like an heaped mountaine lay
The knight himselfe even trembled at his fall
So huge and horrible a masse it seem'd
And his deare Ladie that beheld it all
Durst not approch for dread which she misdeem'd
But yet at last whenas the direfull feend
She saw not stirre off-shaking vaine affright
She nigher drew and saw that joyous end
Then God she praysd and thankt her faithfull knight
That had atchieved so great a conquest by his might
BEHOLD I see the haven nigh at hand
To which I meane my wearie course to bend
Vere the maine shete and beare up with the land
The which afore is fairely to be kend
And seemeth safe from storms that may offend
There this faire virgin wearie of her way
Must landed be now at her journeyes end
There eke my feeble barke a while may stay
Till merry wind and weather call her thence away
Scarsely had Phoebus in the glooming East
Yet harnessed his firie-footed teeme
Ne reard above the earth his flaming creast
When the last deadly smoke aloft did steeme
That signe of last outbreathed life did seeme
Unto the watchman on the castle wall
Who thereby dead that balefull Beast did deeme
And to his Lord and Ladie lowd gan call
To tell how he had seene the Dragons fatall fall
Uprose with hastie joy and feeble speed
That aged Sire the Lord of all that land
And looked forth to weet if true indeede
Those tydings were as he did understand
Which whenas true by tryall he out found
He bad to open wyde his brazen gate
Which long time had bene shut and out of hond
Proclaymed joy and peace through all his state
For dead now was their foe which them forrayed late
Then gan triumphant Trompets sound on hie
That sent to heaven the ecchoed report
Of their new joy and happie victorie
Gainst him that had them long opprest with tort
And fast imprisoned in sieged fort
Then all the people as in solemne feast
To him assembled with one full consort
Rejoycing at the fall of that great beast
From whose eternall bondage now they were releast
Forth came that auncient Lord and aged Queene
Arayd in antique robes downe to the ground
And sad habiliments right well beseene
A noble crew about them waited round
Of sage and sober Peres all gravely gownd
Whom farre before did march a goodly band
Of tall young men all hable armes to sownd
But now they laurell braunches bore in hand
Glad signe of victorie and peace in all their land
Unto that doughtie Conquerour they came
And him before themselves prostrating low
Their Lord and Patrone loud did him proclame
And at his feet their laurell boughes did throw
Soone after them all dauncing on a row
The comely virgins came with girlands dight
As fresh as flowres in medow greene do grow
When morning deaw upon their leaves doth light
And in their hands sweet Timbrels all upheld on hight
And them before the fry of children young
Their wanton sports and childish mirth did play
And to the Maydens sounding tymbrels sung
In well attuned notes a joyous lay
And made delightfull musicke all the way
Untill they came where that faire virgin stood
As faire Diana in fresh sommers day
Beholds her Nymphes enraung'd in shadie wood
Some wrestle some do run some bathe in christall flood
So she beheld those maydens meriment
With chearefull vew who when to her they came
Themselves to ground with gracious humblesse bent
And her ador'd by honorable name
Lifting to heaven her everlasting fame
Then on her head they set a girland greene
And crowned her twixt earnest and twixt game
Who in her self-resemblance well beseene
Did seeme such as she was a goodly maiden Queene
And after all the raskall many ran
Heaped together in rude rablement
To see the face of that victorious man
Whom all admired as from heaven sent
And gazd upon with gaping wonderment
But when they came where that dead Dragon lay
Stretcht on the ground in monstrous large extent
The sight with idle feare did them dismay
Ne durst approch him nigh to touch or once assay
Some feard and fled some feard and well it faynd
One that would wiser seeme then all the rest
Warnd him not touch for yet perhaps remaynd
Some lingring life within his hollow brest
Or in his wombe might lurke some hidden nest
Of many Dragonets his fruitfull seed
Another said that in his eyes did rest
Yet sparckling fire and bad thereof take heed
Another said he saw him move his eyes indeed
One mother when as her foolehardie chyld
Did come too neare and with his talants play
Halfe dead through feare her little babe revyld
And to her gossips gan in counsell say
How can I tell but that his talants may
Yet scratch my sonne or rend his tender hand
So diversly themselves in vaine they fray
Whiles some more bold to measure him nigh stand
To prove how many acres he did spread of land
Thus flocked all the folke him round about
The whiles that hoarie king with all his traine
Being arrived where that champion stout
After his foes defeasance did remaine
Him goodly greetes and faire does entertaine
With princely gifts of yvorie and gold
And thousand thankes him yeelds for all his paine
Then when his daughter deare he does behold
Her dearely doth imbrace and kisseth manifold
And after to his Pallace he them brings
With shaumes and trompets and with Clarions sweet
And all the way the joyous people sings
And with their garments strowes the paved street
Whence mounting up they find purveyance meet
Of all that royall Princes court became
And all the floore was underneath their feet
Bespred with costly scarlot of great name
On which they lowly sit and fitting purpose frame
What needs me tell their feast and goodly guize
In which was nothing riotous nor vaine
What needs of dainty dishes to devize
Of comely services or courtly trayne
My narrow leaves cannot in them containe
The large discourse of royall Princes state
Yet was their manner then but bare and plaine
For th' antique world excesse and pride did hate
Such proud luxurious pompe is swollen up but late
Then when with meates and drinkes of every kinde
Their fervent appetites they quenched had
That auncient Lord gan fit occasion finde
Of straunge adventures and of perils sad
Which in his travell him befallen had
For to demaund of his renowmed guest
Who then with utt'rance grave and count'nance sad
From point to point as is before exprest
Discourst his voyage long according his request
Great pleasures mixt with pittiful regard
That godly King and Queene did passionate
Whiles they his pittifull adventures heard
That oft they did lament his lucklesse state
And often blame the too importune fate
That heaped on him so many wrathfull wreakes
For never gentle knight as he of late
So tossed was in fortunes cruell freakes
And all the while salt teares bedeawd the hearers cheaks
Then sayd the royall Pere in sober wise
Deare Sonne great beene the evils which ye bore
From first to last in your late enterprise
That I note whether prayse or pitty more
For never living man I weene so sore
In sea of deadly daungers was distrest
But since now safe ye seised have the shore
And well arrived are high God be blest
Let us devize of ease and everlasting rest
Ah dearest Lord said then that doughty knight
Of ease or rest I may not yet devize
For by the faith which I to armes have plight
I bounden am streight after this emprize
As that your daughter can ye well advize
Backe to returne to that great Faerie Queene
And her to serve six yeares in warlike wize
Gainst that proud Paynim king that workes her teene
Therefore I ought crave pardon till I there have beene
Unhappie falles that hard necessitie
Quoth he the troubler of my happie peace
And vowed foe of my felicitie
Ne I against the same can justly preace
But since that band ye cannot now release
Nor doen undo for vowes may not be vaine
Soone as the terme of those six yeares shall cease
Ye then shall hither backe returne againe
The marriage to accomplish vowd betwixt you twain
Which for my part I covet to performe
In sort as through the world I did proclame
That whoso kild that monster most deforme
And him in hardy battaile overcame
Should have mine onely daughter to his Dame
And of my kingdome heyre apparaunt bee
Therefore since now to thee perteines the same
By dew desert of noble chevalree
Both daughter and eke kingdome lo I yield to thee
Then forth he called that his daughter faire
The fairest Un' his onely daughter deare
His onely daughter and his onely heyre
Who forth proceeding with sad sober cheare
As bright as doth the morning starre appeare
Out of the East with flaming lockes bedight
To tell that dawning day is drawing neare
And to the world does bring long wished light
So faire and fresh that Lady shewd her selfe in sight
So faire and fresh as freshest flowre in May
For she had layd her mournefull stole aside
And widow-like sad wimple throwne away
Wherewith her heavenly beautie she did hide
Whiles on her wearie journey she did ride
And on her now a garment she did weare
All lilly white withoutten spot or pride
That seemd like silke and silver woven neare
But neither silke nor silver therein did appeare
The blazing brightnesse of her beauties beame
And glorious light of her sunshyny face
To tell were as to strive against the streame
My ragged rimes are all too rude and bace
Her heavenly lineaments for to enchace
Ne wonder for her owne deare loved knight
All were she dayly with himselfe in place
Did wonder much at her celestiall sight
Oft had he seene her faire but never so faire dight
So fairely dight when she in presence came
She to her Sire made humble reverence
And bowed low that her right well became
And added grace unto her excellence
Who with great wisedome and grave eloquence
Thus gan to say But eare he thus had said
With flying speede and seeming great pretence
Came running in much like a man dismaid
A Messenger with letters which his message said
All in the open hall amazed stood
At suddeinnesse of that unwarie sight
And wondred at his breathlesse hastie mood
But he for nought would stay his passage right
Till fast before the king he did alight
Where falling flat great humblesse he did make
And kist the ground whereon his foot was pight
Then to his hands that writ he did betake
Which he disclosing red thus as the paper spake
To thee most mighty king of Eden faire
Her greeting sends in these sad lines addrest
The wofull daughter and forsaken heire
Of that great Emperour of all the West
And bids thee be advized for the best
Ere thou thy daughter linck in holy band
Of wedlocke to that new unknowen guest
For he already plighted his right hand
Unto another love and to another land
To me sad mayd or rather widow sad
He was affiaunced long time before
And sacred pledges he both gave and had
False erraunt knight infamous and forswore
Witnesse the burning Altars which he swore
And guiltie heavens of his bold perjury
Which though he hath polluted oft of yore
Yet I to them for judgement just do fly
And them conjure t'avenge this shamefull injury
Therefore since mine he is or free or bond
Or false or trew or living or else dead
Withhold O soveraine Prince your hasty hond
From knitting league with him I you aread
Ne weene my right with strength adowne to tread
Through weaknesse of my widowhed or woe
For truth is strong her rightfull cause to plead
And shall find friends if need requireth soe
So bids thee well to fare Thy neither friend nor foe Fidessa
When he these bitter byting wordes had red
The tydings straunge did him abashed make
That still he sate long time astonished
As in great muse ne word to creature spake
At last his solemne silence thus he brake
With doubtfull eyes fast fixed on his guest
Redoubted knight that for mine onely sake
Thy life and honour late adventurest
Let nought be hid from me that ought to be exprest
What meane these bloody vowes and idle threats
Throwne out from womanish impatient mind
What heavens what altars what enraged heates
Here heaped up with termes of love unkind
My conscience cleare with guilty bands would bind
High God be witnesse that I guiltlesse ame
But if your selfe Sir knight ye faultie find
Or wrapped be in loves of former Dame
With crime do not it cover but disclose the same
To whom the Redcrosse knight this answere sent
My Lord my King be nought hereat dismayd
Till well ye wote by grave intendiment
What woman and wherefere doth me upbrayd
With breach of love and loyalty betrayd
It was in my mishaps as hitherward
I lately traveild that unwares I strayd
Out of my way through perils straunge and hard
That day should faile me ere I had them all declard
There did I find or rather I was found
Of this false woman that Fidessa hight
Fidessa hight the falsest Dame on ground
Most false Duessa royall richly dight
That easy was to invegle weaker sight
Who by her wicked arts and wylie skill
Too false and strong for earthly skill or might
Unwares me wrought unto her wicked will
And to my foe betrayd when least I feared ill
Then stepped forth the goodly royall Mayd
And on the ground her selfe prostrating low
With sober countenaunce thus to him sayd
O pardon me my soveraigne Lord to show
The secret treasons which of late I know
To have bene wroght by that false sorceresse
She onely she it is that earst did throw
This gentle knight into so great distresse
That death him did awaite in dayly wretchednesse
And now it seemes that she suborned hath
This craftie messenger with letters vaine
To worke new woe and unprovided scath
By breaking of the band betwixt us twaine
Wherein she used hath the practicke paine
Of this false footman clokt with simplenesse
Whom if ye please for to discover plaine
Ye shall him Archimago find I ghesse
The falsest man alive who tries shall find no lesse
The king was greatly moved at her speach
And all with suddein indignation fraight
Bad on that Messenger rude hands to reach
Eftsoones the Gard which on his state did wait
Attacht that faitor false and bound him strait
Who seeming sorely chauffed at his band
As chained Beare whom cruell dogs do bait
With idle force did faine them to withstand
And often semblaunce made to scape out of their hand
But they him layd full low in dungeon deepe
And bound him hand and foote with yron chains
And with continual watch did warely keepe
Who then would thinke that by his subtile trains
He could escape fowle death or deadly paines
Thus when that princes wrath was pacifide
He gan renew the late forbidden bains
And to the knight his daughter dear he tyde
With sacred rites and vowes for ever to abyde
His owne two hands the holy knots did knit
That none but death for ever can devide
His owne two hands for such a turne most fit
The housling fire did kindle and provide
And holy water thereon sprinckled wide
At which the bushy Teade a groome did light
And sacred lamp in secret chamber hide
Where it should not be quenched day nor night
For feare of evill fates but burnen ever bright
Then gan they sprinckle all the posts with wine
And made great feast to solemnize that day
They all perfumde with frankencense divine
And precious odours fetcht from far away
That all the house did sweat with great aray
And all the while sweete Musicke did apply
Her curious skill the warbling notes to play
To drive away the dull Melancholy
The whiles one sung a song of love and jollity
During the which there was an heavenly noise
Heard sound through all the Pallace pleasantly
Like as it had bene many an Angels voice
Singing before th' eternall Majesty
In their trinall triplicities on hye
Yet wist no creature whence that heavenly sweet
Proceeded yet eachone felt secretly
Himselfe thereby reft of his sences meet
And ravished with rare impression in his sprite
Great joy was made that day of young and old
And solemne feast proclaimd throughout the land
That their exceeding merth may not be told
Suffice it heare by signes to understand
The usuall joyes at knitting of loves band
Thrise happy man the knight himselfe did hold
Possessed of his Ladies hart and hand
And ever when his eye did her behold
His heart did seeme to melt in pleasures manifold
Her joyous presence and sweet company
In full content he there did long enjoy
Ne wicked envie ne vile gealosy
His deare delights were able to annoy
Yet swimming in that sea of blissfull joy
He nought forgot how he whilome had sworne
In case he could that monstrous beast destroy
Unto his Faerie Queene backe to returne
The which he shortly did and Una left to mourne
Now strike your sailes ye jolly Mariners
For we be come unto a quiet rode
Where we must land some of our passengers
And light this wearie vessell of her lode
Here she a while may make her safe abode
Till she repaired have her tackles spent
And wants supplide And then againe abroad
On the long voyage whereto she is bent
Well may she speede and fairely finish her intent
In autumpne whan the sonne in Virgine
By radyante hete enryped hath our corne
Whan Luna full of mutabylyte
As emperes the dyademe hath worne
Of our pole artyke smylynge halfe in scorne
At our foly and our vnstedfastnesse
The tyme whan Mars to werre hym dyde dres
I callynge to mynde the greate auctoryte
Of poetes olde whyche full craftely
Vnder as couerte termes as coude be
Can touche a trouth and cloke it subtylly
Wyth fresshe vtteraunce full sentencyously
Dyuerse in style some spared not vyce to wryte
Some of moralyte nobly dyde endyte
Wherby I rede theyr renome and theyr fame
Maye neuer dye bute euermore endure
I was sore moued to aforce the same
But Ignoraunce full soone dyde me dyscure
And shewed that in this arte I was not sure
For to illumyne she sayde I was to dulle
Auysynge me my penne awaye to pulle
And not to wryte for he so wyll atteyne
Excedynge ferther than his connynge is
His hede maye be harde but feble is his brayne
Yet haue I knowen suche er this
But of reproche surely he maye not mys
That clymmeth hyer than he may fotynge haue
What and he slyde downe who shall hym saue
Thus vp and down my mynde was drawen and cast
That I ne wyste what to do was beste
So sore enwered that I was at the laste
Enforsed to slepe and for to take some reste
And to lye downe as soone as I me dreste
At Harwyche Porte slumbrynge as I laye
In myne hostes house called Powers Keye
Methoughte I sawe a shyppe goodly of sayle
Come saylynge forth into that hauen brood
Her takelynge ryche and of hye apparayle
She kyste an anker and there she laye at rode
Marchauntes her borded to see what she had lode
Therein they founde royall marchaundyse
Fraghted with plesure of what ye coude deuyse
But than I thoughte I wolde not dwell behynde
Amonge all other I put myselfe in prece
Than there coude I none aquentaunce fynde
There was moche noyse anone one cryed Cese
Sharpely commaundynge eche man holde hys pece
Maysters he sayde the shyp that ye here see
The Bowge of Courte it hyghte for certeynte

Whoos name to tell is dame Saunce-pere
Her marchaundyse is ryche and fortunate
But who wyll haue it muste paye therfore dere
This royall chaffre that is shypped here
Is called Fauore to stonde in her good grace
Than sholde ye see there pressynge in a pace
Of one and other that wolde this lady see
Whiche sat behynde a traues of sylke fyne
Of golde of tessew the fynest that myghte be

But of eche thynge there as I toke hede
Amonge all other was wrytten in her trone
In golde letters this worde whiche I dyde rede

And as I stode redynge this verse myselfe allone

To be so perte to prese so proudly vppe
She sayde she trowed that I had eten sause
She asked yf euer I dranke of saucys cuppe
And I than softly answered to that clause
That so to saye I had gyuen her no cause
Than asked she me Syr so God the spede
What is thy name and I sayde it was Drede
What mouyd the quod she hydder to come
Forsoth quod I to bye some of youre ware
And with that worde on me she gaue a glome
With browes bente and gan on me to stare
Full daynnously and fro me she dyde fare
Leuynge me stondynge as a mased man
To whome there came an other gentylwoman
Desyre her name was and so she me tolde
Sayenge to me Broder be of good chere
Abasshe you not but hardely be bolde
Auaunce yourselfe to aproche and come nere
What though our chaffer be neuer so dere
Yet I auyse you to speke for ony drede
Who spareth to speke in fayth he spareth to spede
Maystres quod I I haue none aquentaunce
That wyll for me be medyatoure and mene
And this an other I haue but smale substaunce
Pece quod Desyre ye speke not worth a bene
Yf ye haue not in fayth I wyll you lene
A precyous jewell no rycher in this londe
Bone Auenture haue here now in your honde
Shyfte now therwith let see as ye can
In Bowge of Courte cheuysaunce to make
For I dare saye that there nys erthly man
But an he can Bone Auenture take
There can no fauour nor frendshyp hym forsake
Bone Auenture may brynge you in suche case
That ye shall stonde in fauoure and in grace
But of one thynge I werne you er I goo
She that styreth the shyp make her your frende
Maystres quod I I praye you tell me why soo
And how I maye that waye and meanes fynde
Forsothe quod she how euer blowe the wynde
Fortune gydeth and ruleth all oure shyppe
Whome she hateth shall ouer the see boorde skyp
Whome she loueth of all plesyre is ryche
Whyles she laugheth and hath luste for to playe
Whome she hateth she casteth in the dyche
For whan she frouneth she thynketh to make a fray
She cheryssheth him and hym she casseth awaye
Alas quod I how myghte I haue her sure
In fayth quod she by Bone Auenture
Thus in a rowe of martchauntes a grete route
Suwed to Fortune that she wold be theyre frynde
They thronge in fast and flocked her aboute
And I with them prayed her to haue in mynde
She promysed to vs all she wolde be kynde
Of Bowge of Court she asketh what we wold haue
And we asked Fauoure and Fauour she vs gaue
The sayle is vp Fortune ruleth our helme
We wante no wynde to passe now ouer all
Fauoure we haue tougher than ony elme
That wyll abyde and neuer from vs fall
But vnder hony ofte tyme lyeth bytter gall
For as me thoughte in our shyppe I dyde see
Full subtyll persones in nombre foure and thre
The fyrste was Fauell full of flatery
Wyth fables false that well coude fayne a tale
The seconde was Suspecte whiche that dayly
Mysdempte eche man with face deedly and pale
And Haruy Hafter that well coude picke a male
With other foure of theyr affynyte
Dysdayne Ryotte Dyssymuler Subtylte
Fortune theyr frende with whome oft she dyde daunce
They coude not faile thei thought they were so sure
And oftentymes I wolde myselfe auaunce
With them to make solace and pleasure
But my dysporte they coude not well endure
They sayde they hated for to dele with Drede
Than Fauell gan wyth fayre speche me to fede
Noo thynge erthely that I wonder so sore
As of your connynge that is so excellent
Deynte to haue with vs suche one in store
So vertuously that hath his dayes spente
Fortune to you gyftes of grace hath lente
Loo what it is a man to haue connynge
All erthly tresoure it is surmountynge
Ye be an apte man as ony can be founde
To dwell with vs and serue my ladyes grace
Ye be to her yea worth a thousande pounde
I herde her speke of you within shorte space
Whan there were dyuerse that sore dyde you manace
And though I say it I was myselfe your frende
For here be dyuerse to you that be vnkynde
But this one thynge ye maye be sure of me
For by that Lorde that bought dere all mankynde
I can not flater I muste be playne to the
And ye nede ought man shewe to me your mynde
For ye haue me whome faythfull ye shall fynde
Whyles I haue ought by God thou shalt not lacke
And yf nede be a bolde worde I dare cracke
Nay naye be sure whyles I am on your syde
Ye maye not fall truste me ye maye not fayle
Ye stonde in fauoure and Fortune is your gyde
And as she wyll so shall our grete shyppe sayle
Thyse lewde cok wattes shall neuermore preuayle
Ageynste you hardely therfore be not afrayde
Farewell tyll soone but no worde that I sayde
Than thanked I hym for his grete gentylnes
But as me thoughte he ware on hym a cloke
That lyned was with doubtfull doublenes
Me thoughte of wordes that he had full a poke
His stomak stuffed ofte tymes dyde reboke
Suspycyon me thoughte mette hym at a brayde
And I drewe nere to herke what they two sayde
In faythe quod Suspecte spake Drede no worde of me
Why what than wylte thou lete men to speke
He sayth he can not well accorde with the
Twyst quod Suspecte goo playe hym I ne reke
By Cryste quod Fauell Drede is soleyne freke
What lete vs holde him vp man for a whyle
Ye soo quod Suspecte he maye vs bothe begyle
And whan he came walkynge soberly
Wyth whom and ha and with a croked loke
Me thoughte his hede was full of gelousy
His eyen rollynge his hondes faste they quoke
And to me warde the strayte waye he toke
God spede broder to me quod he than
And thus to talke with me he began
Ye remembre the gentylman ryghte nowe
That commaunde with you me thought a party space
Beware of him for I make God auowe
He wyll begyle you and speke fayre to your face
Ye neuer dwelte in suche an other place
For here is none that dare well other truste
But I wolde telle you a thynge and I durste
Spake he a fayth no worde to you of me
I wote and he dyde ye wolde me telle
I haue a fauoure to you wherof it be
That I muste shewe you moche of my counselle
But I wonder what the deuyll of helle
He sayde of me whan he with you dyde talke
By myne auyse vse not with him to walke
The soueraynst thynge that ony man maye haue
Is lytyll to saye and moche to here and see
For but I trusted you so God me saue
I wolde noo thynge so playne be
To you oonly me thynke I durste shryue me
For now am I plenarely dysposed
To shewe you thynges that may not be disclosed
Than I assured hym my fydelyte
His counseyle secrete neuer to dyscure
Yf he coude fynde in herte to truste me
Els I prayed hym with all my besy cure
To kepe it hymselfe for than he myghte be sure
That noo man erthly coude hym bewreye
Whyles of his mynde it were lockte with the keye
By God quod he this and thus it is
And of his mynde he shewed me all and some
Farewell quod he we wyll talke more of this
Soo he departed there he wolde be come
I dare not speke I promysed to be dome
But as I stode musynge in my mynde
Haruy Hafter came lepynge lyghte as lynde
Vpon his breste he bare a versynge boxe
His throte was clere and lustely coude fayne
Me thoughte his gowne was all furred wyth foxe
And euer he sange Sythe I am no thynge playne
To kepe him frome pykynge it was a grete payne
He gased on me with his gotyshe berde
Whan I loked on hym my purse was half aferde
Syr God you saue why loke ye so sadde
What thynge is that I maye do for you
A wonder thynge that ye waxe not madde
For and I studye sholde as ye doo nowe
My wytte wolde waste I make God auowe
Tell me your mynde me thynke ye make a verse
I coude it skan and ye wolde it reherse
But to the poynte shortely to procede
Where hathe your dwellynge ben er ye cam here
For as I trowe I haue sene you indede
Er this whan that ye made me royall chere
Holde vp the helme loke vp and lete God stere
I wolde be mery what wynde that euer blowe
Heue and how rombelow row the bote Norman rowe
Prynces of yougthe can ye synge by rote
Or shall I sayle wyth you a felashyp assaye
For on the booke I can not synge a note
Wolde to God it wolde please you some daye
A balade boke before me for to laye
And lerne me to synge Re my fa sol
And whan I fayle bobbe me on the noll
Loo what is to you a pleasure grete
To haue that connynge and wayes that ye haue
By Goddis soule I wonder how ye gete
Soo greate pleasyre or who to you it gaue
Syr pardone me I am an homely knaue
To be with you thus perte and thus bolde
But ye be welcome to our housholde
And I dare saye there is no man here inne
But wolde be glad of your company
I wyste neuer man that so soone coude wynne
The fauoure that ye haue with my lady
I praye to God that it maye neuer dy
It is your fortune for to haue that grace
As I be saued it is a wonder case
For as for me I serued here many a daye
And yet vnneth I can haue my lyuynge
But I requyre you no worde that I saye
For and I knowe ony erthly thynge
That is agayne you ye shall haue wetynge
And ye be welcome syr so God me saue
I hope here after a frende of you to haue
Wyth that as he departed soo fro me
Anone ther mette with him as me thoughte
A man but wonderly besene was he
He loked hawte he sette eche man at noughte
His gawdy garment with scornnys was all wrought
With indygnacyon lyned was his hode
He frowned as he wolde swere by Cockes blode
He bote the lyppe he loked passynge coye
His face was belymmed as byes had him stounge
It was no tyme with him to jape nor toye
Enuye hathe wasted his lyuer and his lounge
Hatred by the herte so had hym wrounge
That he loked pale as asshes to my syghte
Dysdayne I wene this comerous crabes hyghte
To Heruy Hafter than he spake of me
And I drewe nere to harke what they two sayde
Now quod Dysdayne as I shall saued be
I haue grete scorne and am ryghte euyll apayed
Than quod Heruy why arte thou so dysmayde
By Cryste quod he for it is shame to saye
To see Johan Dawes that came but yester daye
How he is now taken in conceyte
This doctour Dawcocke Drede I wene he hyghte
By Goddis bones but yf we haue som sleyte
It is lyke he wyll stonde in our lyghte
By God quod Heruy and it so happen myghte
Lete vs therfore shortely at a worde
Fynde some mene to caste him ouer the borde
By Him that me boughte than quod Dysdayne
I wonder sore he is in suche conceyte
Turde quod Hafter I wyll the no thynge layne
There muste for hym be layde some prety beyte
We tweyne I trowe be not withoute dysceyte
Fyrste pycke a quarell and fall oute with hym then
And soo outface hym with a carde of ten
Forthwith he made on me a prowde assawte
With scornfull loke meuyd all in moode
He wente aboute to take me in a fawte
He frounde he stared he stampped where he stoode
I lokyd on hym I wende he had be woode
He set the arme proudly vnder the syde
And in this wyse he gan with me to chyde
Remembrest thou what thou sayd yester nyght
Wylt thou abyde by the wordes agayne
By God I haue of the now grete dyspyte
I shall the angre ones in euery vayne
It is greate scorne to see suche an hayne
As thou arte one that cam but yesterdaye
With vs olde seruauntes suche maysters to playe
I tell the I am of countenaunce
What weneste I were I trowe thou knowe not me
By Goddis woundes but for dysplesaunce
Of my querell soone wolde I venged be
But no force I shall ones mete with the
Come whan it wyll oppose the I shall
What someuer auenture therof fall
Trowest thou dreuyll I saye thou gawdy knaue
That I haue deynte to see the cherysshed thus
By Goddis syde my sworde thy berde shall shaue
Well ones thou shalte be chermed I wus
Naye strawe for tales thou shalte not rule vs
We be thy betters and so thou shalte vs take
Or we shall the oute of thy clothes shake
Wyth that came Ryotte russhynge all at ones
A rusty gallande to-ragged and to-rente
And on the borde he whyrled a payre of bones
Quater treye dews he clatered as he wente
Now haue at all by saynte Thomas of Kente
And euer he threwe and kyst I wote nere what
His here was growen thorowe oute his hat
Thenne I behelde how he dysgysed was
His hede was heuy for watchynge ouer nyghte
His eyen blereed his face shone lyke a glas
His gowne so shorte that it ne couer myghte
His rumpe he wente so all for somer lyghte
His hose was garded wyth a lyste of grene
Yet at the knee they were broken I wene
His cote was checked with patches rede and blewe
Of Kyrkeby Kendall was his shorte demye
And ay he sange In fayth decon thou crewe
His elbowe bare he ware his gere so nye
His nose a droppynge his lyppes were full drye
And by his syde his whynarde and his pouche
The deuyll myghte daunce therin for ony crowche
Counter he coude O lux vpon a potte
An eestryche fedder of a capons tayle
He set vp fresshely vpon his hat alofte
What reuell route quod he and gan to rayle
How ofte he hadde hit Jenet on the tayle
Of Felyce fetewse and lytell prety Cate
How ofte he knocked at her klycked gate
What sholde I tell more of his rebaudrye
I was ashamed so to here hym prate
He had no pleasure but in harlotrye
Ay quod he in the deuylles date
What arte thou I sawe the nowe but late
Forsothe quod I in this courte I dwell nowe
Welcome quod Ryote I make God auowe
And syr in fayth why comste not vs amonge
To make the mery as other felowes done
Thou muste swere and stare man al daye longe
And wake all nyghte and slepe tyll it be none
Thou mayste not studye or muse on the mone
This worlde is nothynge but ete drynke and slepe
And thus with vs good company to kepe
Plucke vp thyne herte vpon a mery pyne
And lete vs laugh a placke or tweyne at nale
What the deuyll man myrthe was neuer one
What loo man see here of dyce a bale
A brydelynge caste for that is in thy male
Now haue at all that lyeth vpon the burde
Fye on this dyce they be not worth a turde
Haue at the hasarde or at the dosen browne
Or els I pas a peny to a pounde
Now wolde to God thou wolde leye money downe
Lorde how that I wolde caste it full rounde
Ay in my pouche a buckell I haue founde
The armes of Calyce I haue no coyne nor crosse
I am not happy I renne ay on the losse
Now renne muste I to the stewys syde
To wete yf Malkyn my lemman haue gete oughte
I lete her to hyre that men maye on her ryde
Her armes easy ferre and nere is soughte
By Goddis sydes syns I her thyder broughte
She hath gote me more money with her tayle
Than hath some shyppe that into Bordews sayle
Had I as good an hors as she is a mare
I durst auenture to iourney thorugh Fraunce
Who rydeth on her he nedeth not to care
For she is trussed for to breke a launce
It is a curtel that well can wynche and praunce
To her wyll I nowe all my pouerte lege
And tyll I come haue here is myne hat to plege
Gone is this knaue this rybaude foule and leude
He ran as fast as euer that he myghte
Vnthryftynes in hym may well be shewed
For whome Tyborne groneth both daye and nyghte
And as I stode and kyste asyde my syghte
Dysdayne I sawe with Dyssymulacyon
Standynge in sadde communicacion
But there was poyntynge and noddynge with the hede
And many wordes sayde in secrete wyse
They wandred ay and stode styll in no stede
Me thoughte alwaye Dyscymular dyde deuyse
Me passynge sore myne herte than gan agryse
I dempte and drede theyr talkynge was not good
Anone Dyscymular came where I stode
Than in his hode I sawe there faces tweyne
That one was lene and lyke a pyned goost
That other loked as he wolde me haue slayne
And to me warde as he gan for to coost
Whan that he was euen at me almoost
I sawe a knyfe hyd in his one sleue
Wheron was wryten this worde Myscheue
And in his other sleue me thought I sawe
A spone of golde full of hony swete
To fede a fole and for to preue a dawe
And on that sleue these wordes were wrete
A false abstracte cometh from a fals concrete
His hode was syde his cope was roset graye
Thyse were the wordes that he to me dyde saye
How do ye mayster ye loke so soberly
As I be saued at the dredefull daye
It is a perylous vyce this enuy
Alas a connynge man ne dwelle maye
In no place well but foles with hym fraye
But as for that connynge hath no foo
Saue hym that nought can Scrypture sayth soo
I knowe your vertu and your lytterature
By that lytel connynge that I haue
Ye be malygned sore I you ensure
But ye haue crafte your selfe alwaye to saue
It is grete scorne to se a mysproude knaue
With a clerke that connynge is to prate
Lete theym go lowse theym in the deuylles date
For all be it that this longe not to me
Yet on my backe I bere suche lewde delynge
Ryghte now I spake with one I trowe I see
But what a strawe I maye not tell all thynge
By God I saye there is grete herte brennynge
Betwene the persone ye wote of you
Alas I coude not dele so with a Jew
I wolde eche man were as playne as I
It is a worlde I saye to here of some
I hate this faynynge fye vpon it fye
A man can not wote where to be come
I wys I coude tell but humlery home
I dare not speke we be so layde awayte
For all our courte is full of dysceyte
Now by saynte Fraunceys that holy man and frere
I hate these wayes agayne you that they take
Were I as you I wolde ryde them full nere
And by my trouthe but yf an ende they make
Yet wyll I saye some wordes for your sake
That shall them angre I holde thereon a grote
For some shall wene be hanged by the throte
I haue a stoppynge oyster in my poke
Truste me and yf it come to a nede
But I am lothe for to reyse a smoke
Yf ye coude be otherwyse agrede
And so I wolde it were so God me spede
For this maye brede to a confusyon
Withoute God make a good conclusyon
Naye see where yonder stondeth the teder man
A flaterynge knaue and false he is God wote
The dreuyll stondeth to herken and he can
It were more thryft he boughte him a newe cote
It will not be his purse is not on flote
All that he wereth it is borowed ware
His wytte is thynne his hode is threde bare
More coude I saye but what this is ynowe
Adewe tyll soone we shall speke more of this
Ye muste be ruled as I shall tell you howe
Amendis maye be of that is now amys
And I am your syr so haue I blys
In euery poynte that I can do or saye
Gyue me your honde farewell and haue good daye
Sodaynly as he departed me fro
Came pressynge in one in a wonder araye
Er I was ware behynde me he sayde Bo
Thenne I astonyed of that sodeyne fraye
Sterte all at ones I lyked no thynge his playe
For yf I had not quyckely fledde the touche
He had plucte oute the nobles of my pouche
He was trussed in a garmente strayte
I haue not sene suche an others page
For he coude well vpon a casket wayte
His hode all pounsed and garded lyke a cage
Lyghte lyme fynger he toke none other wage
Harken quod he loo here myne honde in thyne
To vs welcome thou arte by saynte Quyntyne
But by that Lorde that is one two and thre
I haue an errande to rounde in your ere
He tolde me so by God ye maye truste me
Parte remembre whan ye were there
There I wynked on you wote ye not where
In A loco I mene juxta B
Woo is hym that is blynde and maye not see
But to here the subtylte and the crafte
As I shall tell you yf ye wyll harke agayne
And whan I sawe the horsons wolde you hafte
To holde myne honde by God I had grete payne
For forthwyth there I had him slayne
But that I drede mordre wolde come oute
Who deleth with shrewes hath nede to loke aboute
And as he rounded thus in myne ere
Of false collusyon confetryd by assente
Me thoughte I see lewde felawes here and there
Came for to slee me of mortall entente
And as they came the shypborde faste I hente
And thoughte to lepe and euen with that woke
Caughte penne and ynke and wrote this lytyll boke
I wolde therwith no man were myscontente
Besechynge you that shall it see or rede
In euery poynte to be indyfferente
Syth all in substaunce of slumbrynge doth procede
I wyll not saye it is mater in dede
But yet oftyme suche dremes be founde trewe
Now constrewe ye what is the resydewe
The lively sparks that issue from those eyes
Against the which ne vaileth no defence
Have pressed mine heart and done it none offence
With quaking pleasure more than once or twice
Was never man could anything devise
The sun beams to turn with so great vehemence
To daze man sight as by their bright presence
Dazed am I much like unto the guise
Of one ystricken with dint of lightning
Blinded with the stroke erring here and there
So call I for help I not when ne where
The pain of my fault patiently bearing
For after the blaze as is no wonder
Of deadly 'Nay' hear I the fearful thunder
Like to these unmeasurable mountains
Is my painfull life the burden of ire
For of great height be they and high is my desire
And I of tears and they be full of fountains
Under craggy rocks they have full barren plains
Hard thoughts in me my woeful mind doth tire
Small fruit and many leaves their tops do attire
Small effect with great trust in me remains
The boistrous winds oft their high boughs do blast
Hot sighs from me continually be shed
Cattle in them and in me love is fed
Immoveable am I and they are full steadfast 
Of that restless birds they have the tune and note
And I always plaints that pass through my throat
How oft have I my dear and cruel foe
With those your eyes for to get peace and truce
Proffered you mine heart but you do not use
Among so high things to cast your mind so low
If any other look for it as ye trow
Their vain weak hope doth greatly them abuse
And thus I disdain that ye refuse
It was once mine it can no more be so
If I then it chase nor it in you can find
In this exile no manner of comfort
Nor live alone nor where he is called resort
He may wander from his natural kind
So shall it be great hurt unto us twain
And your the loss and mine the deadly pain
Love and fortune and my mind rememberer
Of that that is now with that that hath been
Do torment me so that I very often
Envy them beyond all measure
Love slayeth mine heart fortune is depriver
Of all my comfort the foolish mind then
Burneth and plaineth as one that seldom
Liveth in rest still in displeasure
My pleasant days they fleet away and pass
But daily yet the ill doth change into the worse
And more than the half is run of my course
Alas not of steel but of brickle glass
I see that from mine hand falleth my trust
And all my thoughts are dashed into dust
Ever mine hap is slack and slow in coming
Desire increasing mine hope uncertain
That leave it or wait it doth me like pain
And Tiger like swift it is in parting
Alas the snow shall be black and scalding
The sea waterless fish in the mountain
The Thames shall return back into his fountain
And where he rose the sun shall take lodging
Ere that I in this find peace or quietness
Or that love or my lady rightwisely
Leave to conspire again me wrongfully
And if that I have after such bitterness
Any thing sweet my mouth is out of taste
And all my trust and travail is but waste
My galley charged with forgetfulness
Thorough sharp seas in winter nights doth pass
'Tween rock and rock and eke mine enemy alas
That is my Lord steereth with cruelness
And every oar a thought in readiness
As though that death were light in such a case
An endless wind doth tear the sail apace
Of forced sighes and trusty fearfulness
A rain of tears a cloud of dark disdain
Hath done the wearied cords great hindrance
Wreathed with error and eke with ignorance
The stars be hid that led me to this pain
Drowned is reason that should me comfort
And I remain despairing of the port
Though I my self be bridled of my mind
Returning me backward by force express
If thou seek honour to keep thy promise
Who may thee hold my heart but thou thyself unbind
Sigh thou no more since no way man may find
Thy virtue to let though that frowardness
Of fortune me holdeth and yet as I may guess
Though other be present thou art not all behind
Suffice it then that thou be ready there
At all hours still under the defence
Of time truth and love to save thee from offence
Crying I burn in a lovely desire
With my mistress that may not follow
Whereby his absence turneth him to sorrow
I find no peace and all my war is done
I fear and hope I burn and freeze like ice
I fly above the wind yet can I not arise
And nought I have and all the world I seson
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison
And holdeth me not yet can I scape nowise
Nor letteth me live nor die at my devise
And yet of death it giveth me occasion
Without eyen I see and without tongue I plain
I desire to perish and yet I ask health
I love another and thus I hate myself
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain
Likewise displeaseth me both death and life
And my delight is causer of this strife
Because I have thee still kept from lies and blame
And to my power always have I thee honoured
Unkind tongue right ill hast thou me rendered
For such desert to do me wreck and shame
In need of succour most when that I am
To take reward then stand'st thou like one afeared
Alway most cold and if thou speak toward
It is as in dream unperfect and lame
And ye salt tears again my will each night
That are with me when fain I would be alone
Then are ye gone when I should make my moan
And you so ready sighs to make me shright
Then are ye slake when that ye should outstart
And onely my look declareth my heart
Some fowls there be that have so perfect sight
Against the sun their eyes for to defend
And some because the light doth them offend
Do never peare but in the dark or night
Other rejoice that see the fire bright
And ween to play in it as they do pretend
And find the contrary of it that they intend
Alas of that sort I may be by right
For to withstand her look I am not able
And yet cannot I hide me in no dark place
Remembrance so followeth me of that face
So that with teary eyne swollen and unstable
My destiny to behold her doth me lead
Yet do I know I run into the gleed
There was never file half so well filed
To file a file for every smith intent
As I was made a filing instrument
To frame others while I was beguiled
But reason hath at my folly smiled
And pardoned me sins that I me repent
Of my lost years and time mispent
For youth did me lead and falshood guided
Yet this trust I have of full great appearance
Since that deceit is aye returneable
Of very force it is agreeable
That therewithal be done the recompense
Then guile beguiled plained should be never
And the reward little trust for ever
My heart I gave thee not to do it pain
But to preserve it was to thee taken
I served thee not to be forsaken
But that I should be rewarded again
I was content thy servant to remain
But not to be payed under this fashion
Now since in thee is none other reason
Displease thee not if that I do refrain
Unsatiate of my woe and thy desire
Assured be craft to excuse thy fault
But since it please thee to feign a default
Farewell I say parting from the fire
For he that believeth bearing in hand
Plougheth in water and soweth in the sand
Farewell Love and all thy laws for ever
Thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more
Senec and Plato call me from thy lore
To perfect wealth my wit for to endeavour
In blind error when I did persever
Thy sharp repulse that pricketh ay so sore
Hath taught me to set in trifles no store
And scape forth since liberty is liefer
Therefore farewell go trouble younger hearts
And in me claim no more authority
With idle youth go use thy property
And thereon spend thy many brittle darts
For hitherto though I have lost all my time
Me lusteth no longer rotten boughs to climb
If amour faith an heart unfeigned
A sweet languor a great lovely desire
If honest will kindled in gentle fire
If long error in a blind maze chained
If in my visage each thought depainted
Or else in my sparkling voice lower or higher
Which now fear now shame woefully doth tire
If a pale colour which love hath stained
If to have another than myself more dear
If wailing and sighing continually
With sorrowfull anger feeding busily
If burning afar off and freezing near
Are cause that by love my self I destroy
Yours is the fault and mine the great annoy
Each man me telleth I change most my device
And on my faith me think it good reason
To change propose like after the season
For in every case to keep still one guise
Is meet for them that would be taken wise
And I am not of such manner condition
But treated after a diverse fashion
And thereupon my diverseness doth rise
But you that blame this diverseness most
Change you no more but still after one rate
Treat ye me well and keep ye in the same state
And while with me doth dwell this wearied ghost
My word nor I shall not be variable
But always one your own both firm and stable
Was I never yet of your love grieved
Nor never shall while that my life doth last
But of hating myself that date is past
And tears continual sore have me wearied
I will not yet in my grave be buried 
Nor on my tomb your name yfixed fast
As cruel cause that did the spirit soon haste
From th'  bones by great sighs stirred
Then if an heart of amorous faith and will
May content you without doing grief
Please it you so to this to do relief
If otherwise ye seek for to fulfil
Your disdain ye err and shall not as ye ween
And you yourself the cause thereof hath been
Whoso list to hunt I know where is an hind
But as for me helas I may no more
The vain travail hath wearied me so sore
I am of them that farthest cometh behind
Yet may I by no means my wearied mind
Draw from the deer but as she fleeth afore
Fainting I follow I leave off therefore
Since in a net I seek to hold the wind
Who list her hunt I put him out of doubt
As well as I may spend his time in vain
And graven with Diamonds in letters plain
There is written her fair neck round about
Noli me tangere for Caesar I am
And wild for to hold - though I seem tame
The long love that in my thought doth harbour
And in my heart doth keep his residence
Into my face presseth with bold pretence
And therein campeth spreading his banner
She that me learneth to love and suffer
And wills that my trust and lust negligence
Be reined by reason shame and reverence
With his hardiness taketh displeasure
Where with all unto the heart forest he fleeeth
Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry
And there him hideth and not appeareth
What may I do when my master feareth 
But in the field with him to live and die 
For good is the life ending faithfully
Caesar when that the traitor of Egypt
With th' honorable head did him present
Covering his gladness did represent
Plaint with his tears outward as it is writ
And Hannibal eke when fortune him shut
Clean from his reign and from all his intent
Laughed to his folk whom sorrow did torment
His cruel despite for to dis-gorge and quit
So chanceth it oft that every passion
The mind hideth by colour contrary
With feigned visage now sad now merry
Whereby if I laughed any time or season
It is for because I have n' other way
To cloak my care but under sport and play
Such vain thought as wonted to mislead me
In desert hope by well assured moan
Maketh me from company to live alone
In following her whom reason bid me flee
She fleeeth as fast by gentle cruelty
And after her mine heart would fain be gone
But armed sighs my way do stop anon
Twixt hope and dread lacking my liberty
Yet as I guess under disdainful brow
One beam of pity is in her cloudy look
Which comforteth the mind that erst for fear shook
And therewithall bolded I seek the way how
To utter the smart that I suffer within
But such it is I not how to begin
I abide and abide and better abide
And after the old proverb the happy day
And ever my lady to me doth say
Let me alone and I will provide
I abide and abide and tarry the tide
And with abiding speed well ye may
Thus do I abide I wot alway
N' other obtaining nor yet denied
Aye me this long abiding
Seemeth to me as who sayeth
A prolonging of a dying death
Or a refusing of a desired thing
Much were it better for to be plain
Than to say abide and yet shall not obtain
Divers doth use as I have heard and know
When that to change their ladies do begin
To moan and wail and never for to lin
Hoping thereby to pease their painful woe
And some there be that when it chanceth so
That women change and hate where love hath been
They call them false and think with words to win
The hearts of them which otherwhere doth go
But as for me though that by chance indeed
Change hath out-worn the favour that I had
I will not wail lament nor yet be sad
Nor call her false that falsley did me feed
But let it pass and think it is of kind
That often change doth please a woman mind
My love took scorn my service to retain
Wherein methought she used cruelty
Since with good will I lost my liberty
To follow her which causeth all my pain
Might never care cause me for to refrain
But only this which is extremity
Giving me nought alas nor to agree
That as I was her man I might remain
But since that thus ye list to order me
That would have been your servant true and fast
Displease thee not my doting days be past
And with my loss to leave I must agree
For as there is a certain time to rage
So is there time such madness to assuage
To rail or jest ye know I use it not
Tho' that such cause sometime in folks I find
And tho' to change ye list to set your mind
Love it who list in faith I like it not
And if ye were to me as ye are not
I would be loath to see you so unkind
But since your faith must needs be so be kind
Though I hate it I pray you love it not
Things of great weight I never thought to crave
This is but small of right deny it not
Your feigning ways as yet forget them not
But like reward let other lovers have
That is to say for service true and fast
To long delays and changing at the last
Unstable dream according to the place
Be steadfast once or else at least be true
By tasted sweetness make me not to rue
The sudden loss of thy false feigned grace
By good respect in such a dangerous case
Thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew
But madest my sprite live my care to renew
My body in tempest her succour to embrace
The body dead the sprite had his desire
Painless was th'  th'  in delight
Why then alas did it not keep it right
Returning to leap into the fire
And where it was at wish it could not remain
Such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain
You that in love find luck and abundance
And live in lust and joyful jollity
Arise for shame do away your sluggardy
Arise I say do May some observance
Let me in bed lie dreaming in mischance
Let me remember the haps most unhappy
That me betide in May most commonly
As one whom love list little to advance
Sephanes said true that my nativity
Mischanced was with the ruler of the May
He guessed I prove of that the verity
In May my wealth and eke my life I say
Have stonde so oft in such perplexity
Rejoice let me dream of your felicity
If waker care if sudden pale Colour
If many sighs with little speech to plain
Now Joy now woe if they my cheer distain
For hope of small if much to fear therefore
To haste to slack my pace less or more
Be sign of love then do I love again
If thou ask whom sure since I did refrain
Brunet that set my wealth in such a roar
Th'unfeigned cheer of Phillis hath the place
That Brunet had she hath and ever shall
She from myself now hath me in her grace 
She hath in hand my wit my will my all
My heart alone well worthy she doth stay
Without whose help scant do I live a day
The pillar perished is whereto I leant
The strongest stay of mine unquiet mind
The like of it no man again can find
From East to West still seeking though he went
To mine unhap for hap away hath rent
Of all my joy the very bark and rind
And I alas by chance am thus assigned
Dearly to mourn till death do it relent
But since that thus it is by destiny
What can I more but have a woeful heart
My pen in plaint my voice in woeful cry
My mind in woe my body full of smart
And I my self my self always to hate
Till dreadfull death do ease my doleful state
Such is the course that nature kind hath wrought
That snakes have time to cast away their stings
Gainst chained prisoners what need defence be sought 
The fierce lion will hurt no yelden things
Why should such spite be nursed in thy thought
Sith all these powers are pressed under thy wings
And thou seest and reason thee hath taught
What mischief malice many ways it brings
Consider eke that spite availeth naught
Therefore this song thy fault to thee it sings
Displease thee not for saying thus me thought
Nor hate thou him from whom no hate forth springs
For furies that in hell be execrable
For that they hate are made most miserable
The flaming sighs that boil within my breast
Sometime break forth and they can well declare
The hearts unrest and how that it doth fare
The pain thereof the grief and all the rest
The watered eye from whence the tears do fall
Do feel some force or else they would be dry
The wasted flesh of colour dead can try
And something tell what sweetness is in gall
And he that lust to see and do discern
How care can force within a wearied mind
Come he to me - I am that place assigned
But for all this no force it doth no harm
The wound alas hap in some other place
From whence no tool away the scar can rase
But you that of such like have had your part
Can best be judge wherefore my friend so dear
I thought it good my state should now appear
To you and that there is no great desert
And where as you in weighty matters great
Of fortune saw the shadow that you know
For trifling things I now am stricken so
That though I feel my heart doth wound and beat
I sit alone save on the second day
My fever comes with whom I spend the time
In burning heat while that she list assign
And who hath health and liberty alway
Let him thank God and let him not provoke
To have the like of this my painfull stroke
From fairest creatures we desire increase
That thereby beauty rose might never die
But as the riper should by time decease
His tender heir might bear his memory
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
Feed'st thy light flame with self-substantial fuel
Making a famine where abundance lies
Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
Thou that art now the world fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding
Pity the world or else this glutton be
To eat the world due by the grave and thee
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty field
Thy youth proud livery so gazed on now
Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise
How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty use
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse
Proving his beauty by succession thine
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his self-love to stop posterity
Thou art thy mother glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
But if thou live remember'd not to be
Die single and thine image dies with thee
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
Upon thy self thy beauty legacy
Nature bequest gives nothing but doth lend
And being frank she lends to those are free
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
For having traffic with thy self alone
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
What acceptable audit canst thou leave
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
Which used lives th' executor to be
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel
For never-resting time leads summer on
To hideous winter and confounds him there
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where
Then were not summer distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
Beauty effect with beauty were bereft
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
Then let not winter ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer ere thou be distill'd
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
With beauty treasure ere it be self-kill'd
That use is not forbidden usury
Which happies those that pay the willing loan
That for thy self to breed another thee
Or ten times happier be it ten for one
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art
If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
Leaving thee living in posterity
Be not self-will'd for thou art much too fair
To be death conquest and make worms thine heir
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head each under eye
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight
Serving with looks his sacred majesty
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill
Resembling strong youth in his middle age
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
Attending on his golden pilgrimage
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
The eyes 'fore duteous now converted are
From his low tract and look another way
So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon
Unlook'd on diest unless thou get a son
Music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds
By unions married do offend thine ear
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
Mark how one string sweet husband to another
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
Whose speechless song being many seeming one
Sings this to thee 'Thou single wilt prove none
Is it for fear to wet a widow eye
That thou consum'st thy self in single life
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind
When every private widow well may keep
By children eyes her husband shape in mind
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
But beauty waste hath in the world an end
And kept unused the user so destroys it
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits
For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
Who for thy self art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt thou art belov'd of many
But that thou none lov'st is most evident
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove
Make thee another self for love of me
That beauty still may live in thine or thee
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st
In one of thine from that which thou departest
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
Without this folly age and cold decay
If all were minded so the times should cease
And threescore year would make the world away
Let those whom nature hath not made for store
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
Look whom she best endow'd she gave thee more
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
She carv'd thee for her seal and meant thereby
Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
When I do count the clock that tells the time
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
When I behold the violet past prime
And sable curls all silvered o'er with white
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
And summer green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
Then of thy beauty do I question make
That thou among the wastes of time must go
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow
And nothing 'gainst Time scythe can make defence
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
O that you were your self but love you are
No longer yours than you your self here live
Against this coming end you should prepare
And your sweet semblance to some other give
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination then you were
Yourself again after yourself decease
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winter day
And barren rage of death eternal cold
O none but unthrifts Dear my love you know
You had a father let your son say so
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck
And yet methinks I have astronomy
But not to tell of good or evil luck
Of plagues of dearths or seasons' quality
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
And constant stars in them I read such art
As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert'
Or else of thee this I prognosticate
'Thy end is truth and beauty doom and date
When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
When I perceive that men as plants increase
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
And wear their brave state out of memory
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night
And all in war with Time for love of you
As he takes from you I engraft you new
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
And fortify your self in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
Now stand you on the top of happy hours
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
Much liker than your painted counterfeit
So should the lines of life that life repair
Which this Time pencil or my pupil pen
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Can make you live your self in eyes of men
To give away yourself keeps yourself still
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
And in fresh numbers number all your graces
The age to come would say 'This poet lies
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces
So should my papers yellow'd with their age
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue
And your true rights be term'd a poet rage
And stretched metre of an antique song
But were some child of yours alive that time
You should live twice in it and in my rhyme
Shall I compare thee to a summer day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summer lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or nature changing course untrimm'd
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion paws
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger jaws
And burn the long-liv'd phoenix in her blood
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
To the wide world and all her fading sweets
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime
O carve not with thy hours my love fair brow
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty pattern to succeeding men
Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young
A woman face with nature own hand painted
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion
A woman gentle heart but not acquainted
With shifting change as is false women fashion
An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling
Which steals men eyes and women souls amazeth
And for a woman wert thou first created
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting
And by addition me of thee defeated
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
But since she prick'd thee out for women pleasure
Mine be thy love and thy love use their treasure
So is it not with me as with that Muse
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Making a couplement of proud compare
With sun and moon with earth and sea rich gems
With April first-born flowers and all things rare
That heaven air in this huge rondure hems
O let me true in love but truly write
And then believe me my love is as fair
As any mother child though not so bright
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven air
Let them say more that like of hearsay well
I will not praise that purpose not to sell
My glass shall not persuade me I am old
So long as youth and thou are of one date
But when in thee time furrows I behold
Then look I death my days should expiate
For all that beauty that doth cover thee
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart
Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
How can I then be elder than thou art
O therefore love be of thyself so wary
As I not for myself but for thee will
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again
As an unperfect actor on the stage
Who with his fear is put beside his part
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
Whose strength abundance weakens his own heart
So I for fear of trust forget to say
The perfect ceremony of love rite
And in mine own love strength seem to decay
O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love might
O let my looks be then the eloquence
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
Who plead for love and look for recompense
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd
O learn to read what silent love hath writ
To hear with eyes belongs to love fine wit
Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
Thy beauty form in table of my heart
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held
And perspective it is best painter art
For through the painter must you see his skill
To find where your true image pictur'd lies
Which in my bosom shop is hanging still
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
Are windows to my breast where-through the sun
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
They draw but what they see know not the heart
Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun eye
And in themselves their pride lies buried
For at a frown they in their glory die
The painful warrior famoused for fight
After a thousand victories once foil'd
Is from the book of honour razed quite
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd
Then happy I that love and am belov'd
Where I may not remove nor be remov'd
Lord of my love to whom in vassalage
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
To thee I send this written embassage
To witness duty not to show my wit
Duty so great which wit so poor as mine
May make seem bare in wanting words to show it
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
In thy soul thought all naked will bestow it
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
Weary with toil I haste me to my bed
The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd
But then begins a journey in my head
To work my mind when body work expired
For then my thoughts from far where I abide 
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
Looking on darkness which the blind do see
Save that my soul imaginary sight
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
For thee and for myself no quiet find
How can I then return in happy plight
That am debarre'd the benefit of rest
When day oppression is not eas'd by night
But day by night and night by day oppress'd
And each though enemies to either reign
Do in consent shake hands to torture me
The one by toil the other to complain
How far I toil still farther off from thee
I tell the day to please him thou art bright
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
And night doth nightly make grief length seem stronger
When in disgrace with fortune and men eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featur'd like him like him with friends possess'd
Desiring this man art and that man scope
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
Haply I think on thee  and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven gate
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
And with old woes new wail my dear time waste
Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
For precious friends hid in death dateless night
And weep afresh love long since cancell'd woe
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan
Which I new pay as if not paid before
But if the while I think on thee dear friend
All losses are restor'd and sorrows end
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
Which I by lacking have supposed dead
And there reigns Love and all Love loving parts
And all those friends which I thought buried
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
As interest of the dead which now appear
But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
Who all their parts of me to thee did give
That due of many now is thine alone
Their images I lov'd I view in thee
And thou all they hast all the all of me
If thou survive my well-contented day
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
Exceeded by the height of happier men
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
'Had my friend Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
To march in ranks of better equipage
But since he died and poets better prove
Theirs for their style I'll read his for his love'
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
Kissing with golden face the meadows green
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With all triumphant splendour on my brow
But out alack he was but one hour mine
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
Suns of the world may stain when heaven sun staineth
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
And make me travel forth without my cloak
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
The offender sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offence cross
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done
Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
All men make faults and even I in this
Authorizing thy trespass with compare
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense 
Thy adverse party is thy advocate 
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence
Such civil war is in my love and hate
That I an accessary needs must be
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
Let me confess that we two must be twain
Although our undivided loves are one
So shall those blots that do with me remain
Without thy help by me be borne alone
In our two loves there is but one respect
Though in our lives a separable spite
Which though it alter not love sole effect
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love delight
I may not evermore acknowledge thee
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
Nor thou with public kindness honour me
Unless thou take that honour from thy name
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
As a decrepit father takes delight
To see his active child do deeds of youth
So I made lame by Fortune dearest spite
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
Or any of these all or all or more
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
I make my love engrafted to this store
So then I am not lame poor nor despis'd
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
That I in thy abundance am suffic'd
And by a part of all thy glory live
Look what is best that best I wish in thee
This wish I have then ten times happy me
How can my muse want subject to invent
While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
Thine own sweet argument too excellent
For every vulgar paper to rehearse
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
For who so dumb that cannot write to thee
When thou thy self dost give invention light
Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
Eternal numbers to outlive long date
If my slight muse do please these curious days
The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
O how thy worth with manners may I sing
When thou art all the better part of me
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
And what is't but mine own when I praise thee
Even for this let us divided live
And our dear love lose name of single one
That by this separation I may give
That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
To entertain the time with thoughts of love
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
And that thou teachest how to make one twain
By praising him here who doth hence remain
Take all my loves my love yea take them all
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before
No love my love that thou mayst true love call
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
Then if for my love thou my love receivest
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
But yet be blam'd if thou thy self deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
Although thou steal thee all my poverty
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
To bear love wrong than hate known injury
Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
When I am sometime absent from thy heart
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits
For still temptation follows where thou art
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won
Beauteous thou art therefore to be assail'd
And when a woman woos what woman son
Will sourly leave her till he have prevail'd
Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
Who lead thee in their riot even there
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth 
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
Thine by thy beauty being false to me
That thou hast her it is not all my grief
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief
A loss in love that touches me more nearly
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye
Thou dost love her because thou know'st I love her
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
If I lose thee my loss is my love gain
And losing her my friend hath found that loss
Both find each other and I lose both twain
And both for my sake lay on me this cross
But here the joy my friend and I are one
Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
For all the day they view things unrespected
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
How would thy shadow form form happy show
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
By looking on thee in the living day
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
All days are nights to see till I see thee
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
Injurious distance should not stop my way
For then despite of space I would be brought
From limits far remote where thou dost stay
No matter then although my foot did stand
Upon the farthest earth remov'd from thee
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
As soon as think the place where he would be
But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
But that so much of earth and water wrought
I must attend time leisure with my moan
Receiving nought by elements so slow
But heavy tears badges of either woe
The other two slight air and purging fire
Are both with thee wherever I abide
The first my thought the other my desire
These present-absent with swift motion slide
For when these quicker elements are gone
In tender embassy of love to thee
My life being made of four with two alone
Sinks down to death oppress'd with melancholy
Until life composition be recur'd
By those swift messengers return'd from thee
Who even but now come back again assur'd
Of thy fair health recounting it to me
This told I joy but then no longer glad
I send them back again and straight grow sad
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
How to divide the conquest of thy sight
Mine eye my heart thy picture sight would bar
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie 
A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes 
But the defendant doth that plea deny
And says in him thy fair appearance lies
To side this title is impannelled
A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
And by their verdict is determined
The clear eye moiety and the dear heart part
As thus mine eye due is thy outward part
And my heart right thy inward love of heart
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
And each doth good turns now unto the other
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
With my love picture then my eye doth feast
And to the painted banquet bids my heart
Another time mine eye is my heart guest
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part
So either by thy picture or my love
Thy self away art present still with me
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
And I am still with them and they with thee
Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
Awakes my heart to heart and eye delight
How careful was I when I took my way
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust
That to my use it might unused stay
From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
But thou to whom my jewels trifles are
Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
Thou best of dearest and mine only care
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief
Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest
Save where thou art not though I feel thou art
Within the gentle closure of my breast
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
Against that time if ever that time come
When I shall see thee frown on my defects
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
When love converted from the thing it was
Shall reasons find of settled gravity
Against that time do I ensconce me here
Within the knowledge of mine own desert
And this my hand against my self uprear
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
Since why to love I can allege no cause
How heavy do I journey on the way
When what I seek my weary travel end
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
The beast that bears me tired with my woe
Plods dully on to bear that weight in me
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
His rider lov'd not speed being made from thee
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
Which heavily he answers with a groan
More sharp to me than spurring to his side
For that same groan doth put this in my mind
My grief lies onward and my joy behind
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed
From where thou art why should I haste me thence
Till I return of posting is no need
O what excuse will my poor beast then find
When swift extremity can seem but slow
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind
In winged speed no motion shall I know
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace
Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade 
'Since from thee going he went wilful-slow
Towards thee I'll run and give him leave to go
So am I as the rich whose blessed key
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure
The which he will not every hour survey
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
Since seldom coming in that long year set
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are
Or captain jewels in the carcanet
So is the time that keeps you as my chest
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
To make some special instant special-blest
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
Being had to triumph being lacked to hope
What is your substance whereof are you made
That millions of strange shadows on you tend
Since every one hath every one one shade
And you but one can every shadow lend
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you
On Helen cheek all art of beauty set
And you in Grecian tires are painted new
Speak of the spring and foison of the year
The one doth shadow of your beauty show
The other as your bounty doth appear
And you in every blessed shape we know
In all external grace you have some part
But you like none none you for constant heart
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour which doth in it live
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
As the perfumed tincture of the roses
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
When summer breath their masked buds discloses
But for their virtue only is their show
They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade
Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
When that shall vade by verse distills your truth
Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time
When wasteful war shall statues overturn
And broils root out the work of masonry
Nor Mars his sword nor war quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory
'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom
So till the judgment that yourself arise
You live in this and dwell in lovers' eyes
Sweet love renew thy force be it not said
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd
To-morrow sharpened in his former might
So love be thou although to-day thou fill
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
To-morrow see again and do not kill
The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Come daily to the banks that when they see
Return of love more blest may be the view
Or call it winter which being full of care
Makes summer welcome thrice more wished more rare
Being your slave what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire
I have no precious time at all to spend
Nor services to do till you require
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be or your affairs suppose
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
Save where you are how happy you make those
So true a fool is love that in your will
Though you do anything he thinks no ill
That god forbid that made me first your slave
I should in thought control your times of pleasure
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
O let me suffer being at your beck
The imprison'd absence of your liberty
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check
Without accusing you of injury
Be where you list your charter is so strong
That you yourself may privilage your time
To what you will to you it doth belong
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime
I am to wait though waiting so be hell
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
If there be nothing new but that which is
Hath been before how are our brains beguil'd
Which labouring for invention bear amiss
The second burthen of a former child
O that record could with a backward look
Even of five hundred courses of the sun
Show me your image in some antique book
Since mind at first in character was done
That I might see what the old world could say
To this composed wonder of your frame
Wh'r we are mended or wh'r better they
Or whether revolution be the same
O sure I am the wits of former days
To subjects worse have given admiring praise
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
So do our minutes hasten to their end
Each changing place with that which goes before
In sequent toil all forwards do contend
Nativity once in the main of light
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crown'd
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And delves the parallels in beauty brow
Feeds on the rarities of nature truth
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
Is it thy will thy image should keep open
My heavy eyelids to the weary night
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
So far from home into my deeds to pry
To find out shames and idle hours in me
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy
O no thy love though much is not so great
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
To play the watchman ever for thy sake
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
From me far off with others all too near
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
And all my soul and all my every part
And for this sin there is no remedy
It is so grounded inward in my heart
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine
No shape so true no truth of such account
And for myself mine own worth do define
As I all other in all worths surmount
But when my glass shows me myself indeed
Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read
Self so self-loving were iniquity
'Tis thee myself that for myself I praise
Painting my age with beauty of thy days
Against my love shall be as I am now
With Time injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
Hath travell'd on to age steepy night
And all those beauties whereof now he king
Are vanishing or vanished out of sight
Stealing away the treasure of his spring
For such a time do I now fortify
Against confounding age cruel knife
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet love beauty though my lover life
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
And they shall live and he in them still green
When I have seen by Time fell hand defac'd
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age
When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
And the firm soil win of the watery main
Increasing store with loss and loss with store
When I have seen such interchange of state
Or state itself confounded to decay
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate 
That Time will come and take my love away
This thought is as a death which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose
Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
But sad mortality o'ersways their power
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
Whose action is no stronger than a flower
O how shall summer honey breath hold out
Against the wrackful siege of battering days
When rocks impregnable are not so stout
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays
O fearful meditation where alack
Shall Time best jewel from Time chest lie hid
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
O none unless this miracle have might
That in black ink my love may still shine bright
Tired with all these for restful death I cry
As to behold desert a beggar born
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity
And purest faith unhappily forsworn
And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd
And strength by limping sway disabled
And art made tongue-tied by authority
And folly doctor-like controlling skill
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity
And captive good attending captain ill
Tir'd with all these from these would I be gone
Save that to die I leave my love alone
Ah wherefore with infection should he live
And with his presence grace impiety
That sin by him advantage should achieve
And lace itself with his society
Why should false painting imitate his cheek
And steel dead seeming of his living hue
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Roses of shadow since his rose is true
Why should he live now Nature bankrupt is
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins
For she hath no exchequer now but his
And proud of many lives upon his gains
O him she stores to show what wealth she had
In days long since before these last so bad
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now
Before these bastard signs of fair were born
Or durst inhabit on a living brow
Before the golden tresses of the dead
The right of sepulchres were shorn away
To live a second life on second head
Ere beauty dead fleece made another gay
In him those holy antique hours are seen
Without all ornament itself and true
Making no summer of another green
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new
And him as for a map doth Nature store
To show false Art what beauty was of yore
Those parts of thee that the world eye doth view
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
In other accents do this praise confound
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
They look into the beauty of thy mind
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
The soil is this that thou dost common grow
That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect
For slander mark was ever yet the fair
The ornament of beauty is suspect
A crow that flies in heaven sweetest air
So thou be good slander doth but approve
Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
Either not assail'd or victor being charg'd
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
To tie up envy evermore enlarg'd
If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
Nay if you read this line remember not
The hand that writ it for I love you so
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
If thinking on me then should make you woe
O if I say you look upon this verse
When I perhaps compounded am with clay
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
But let your love even with my life decay
Lest the wise world should look into your moan
And mock you with me after I am gone
O lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me that you should love
After my death dear love forget me quite
For you in me can nothing worthy prove
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
To do more for me than mine own desert
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Than niggard truth would willingly impart
O lest your true love may seem false in this
That you for love speak well of me untrue
My name be buried where my body is
And live no more to shame nor me nor you
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
And so should you to love things nothing worth
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
Bare ruin'd choirs where late the sweet birds sang
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west
Which by and by black night doth take away
Death second self that seals up all in rest
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
As the death-bed whereon it must expire
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by
This thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong
To love that well which thou must leave ere long
But be contented when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away
My life hath in this line some interest
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
When thou reviewest this thou dost review
The very part was consecrate to thee
The earth can have but earth which is his due
My spirit is thine the better part of me
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
The prey of worms my body being dead
The coward conquest of a wretch knife
Too base of thee to be remembered
The worth of that is that which it contains
And that is this and this with thee remains
So are you to my thoughts as food to life
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
Now counting best to be with you alone
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
And by and by clean starved for a look
Possessing or pursuing no delight
Save what is had or must from you be took
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
Or gluttoning on all or all away
Why is my verse so barren of new pride
So far from variation or quick change
Why with the time do I not glance aside
To new-found methods and to compounds strange
Why write I still all one ever the same
And keep invention in a noted weed
That every word doth almost tell my name
Showing their birth and where they did proceed
O know sweet love I always write of you
And you and love are still my argument
So all my best is dressing old words new
Spending again what is already spent
For as the sun is daily new and old
So is my love still telling what is told
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
These vacant leaves thy mind imprint will bear
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
Thou by thy dial shady stealth mayst know
Time thievish progress to eternity
Look what thy memory cannot contain
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
Those children nursed deliver'd from thy brain
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
These offices so oft as thou wilt look
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
And found such fair assistance in my verse
As every alien pen hath got my use
And under thee their poesy disperse
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
Have added feathers to the learned wing
And given grace a double majesty
Yet be most proud of that which I compile
Whose influence is thine and born of thee
In others' works thou dost but mend the style
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
But thou art all my art and dost advance
As high as learning my rude ignorance
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd
And my sick Muse doth give an other place
I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of and pays it thee again
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
And found it in thy cheek he can afford
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
Then thank him not for that which he doth say
Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay
O how I faint when I of you do write
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
And in the praise thereof spends all his might
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame
But since your worth wide as the ocean is 
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
My saucy bark inferior far to his
On your broad main doth wilfully appear
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
Or being wrack'd I am a worthless boat
He of tall building and of goodly pride
Then if he thrive and I be cast away
The worst was this my love was my decay
Or I shall live your epitaph to make
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
From hence your memory death cannot take
Although in me each part will be forgotten
Your name from hence immortal life shall have
Though I once gone to all the world must die
The earth can yield me but a common grave
When you entombed in men eyes shall lie
Your monument shall be my gentle verse
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
When all the breathers of this world are dead
You still shall live such virtue hath my pen 
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject blessing every book
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days
And do so love yet when they have devis'd
What strained touches rhetoric can lend
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathiz'd
In true plain words by thy true-telling friend
And their gross painting might be better us'd
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abus'd
I never saw that you did painting need
And therefore to your fair no painting set
I found or thought I found you did exceed
That barren tender of a poet debt
And therefore have I slept in your report
That you yourself being extant well might show
How far a modern quill doth come too short
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
This silence for my sin you did impute
Which shall be most my glory being dumb
For I impair not beauty being mute
When others would give life and bring a tomb
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both your poets can in praise devise
Who is it that says most which can say more
Than this rich praise that you alone are you
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory
But he that writes of you if he can tell
That you are you so dignifies his story
Let him but copy what in you is writ
Not making worse what nature made so clear
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
Making his style admired every where
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still
While comments of your praise richly compil'd
Reserve their character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd
I think good thoughts whilst others write good words
And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen
To every hymn that able spirit affords
In polish'd form of well-refined pen
Hearing you praised I say ''tis so 'tis true
And to the most of praise add something more
But that is in my thought whose love to you
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
Then others for the breath of words respect
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
Bound for the prize of all too precious you
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
No neither he nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid my verse astonished
He nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
As victors of my silence cannot boast
I was not sick of any fear from thence
But when your countenance fill'd up his line
Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine
Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
My bonds in thee are all determinate
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
And for that riches where is my deserving
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
And so my patent back again is swerving
Thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing
Or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking
So thy great gift upon misprision growing
Comes home again on better judgement making
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king but waking no such matter
When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light
And place my merit in the eye of scorn
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight
And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
With mine own weakness being best acquainted
Upon thy part I can set down a story
Of faults conceal'd wherein I am attainted
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory
And I by this will be a gainer too
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
The injuries that to myself I do
Doing thee vantage double-vantage me
Such is my love to thee I so belong
That for thy right myself will bear all wrong
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
And I will comment upon that offence
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt
Against thy reasons making no defence
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
To set a form upon desired change
As I'll myself disgrace knowing thy will
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
Lest I too much profane should do it wrong
And haply of our old acquaintance tell
For thee against my self I'll vow debate
For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
Join with the spite of fortune make me bow
And do not drop in for an after-loss
Ah do not when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
To linger out a purpos'd overthrow
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
When other petty griefs have done their spite
But in the onset come so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortune might
And other strains of woe which now seem woe
Compar'd with loss of thee will not seem so
Some glory in their birth some in their skill
Some in their wealth some in their body force
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill
Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest
But these particulars are not my measure
All these I better in one general best
Thy love is better than high birth to me
Richer than wealth prouder than garments' costs
Of more delight than hawks and horses be
And having thee of all men pride I boast
Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
All this away and me most wretchcd make
But do thy worst to steal thyself away
For term of life thou art assured mine
And life no longer than thy love will stay
For it depends upon that love of thine
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs
When in the least of them my life hath end
I see a better state to me belongs
Than that which on thy humour doth depend
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
O what a happy title do I find
Happy to have thy love happy to die
But what so blessed-fair that fears no blot
Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not
So shall I live supposing thou art true
Like a deceived husband so love face
May still seem love to me though alter'd new
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
For there can live no hatred in thine eye
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
In many looks the false heart history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart workings be
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
How like Eve apple doth thy beauty grow
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
They that have power to hurt and will do none
That do not do the thing they most do show
Who moving others are themselves as stone
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
They rightly do inherit heaven graces
And husband nature riches from expense
They are the lords and owners of their faces
Others but stewards of their excellence
The summer flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die
But if that flower with base infection meet
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
That tongue that tells the story of thy days
Making lascivious comments on thy sport
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
Naming thy name blesses an ill report
O what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee
Where beauty veil doth cover every blot
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see
Take heed dear heart of this large privilege
The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge
Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less
Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort
As on the finger of a throned queen
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd
So are those errors that in thee are seen
To truths translated and for true things deem'd
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
If like a lamb he could his looks translate
How many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen
What old December bareness everywhere
And yet this time removed was summer time
The teeming autumn big with rich increase
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
And thou away the very birds are mute
Or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale dreading the winter near
From you have I been absent in the spring
When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Could make me any summer story tell
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
Nor did I wonder at the lily white
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
They were but sweet but figures of delight
Drawn after you you pattern of all those
Yet seem'd it winter still and you away
As with your shadow I with these did play
The forward violet thus did I chide
Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
If not from my love breath The purple pride
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
In my love veins thou hast too grossly dy'd
The lily I condemned for thy hand
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand
One blushing shame another white despair
A third nor red nor white had stol'n of both
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath
But for his theft in pride of all his growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death
More flowers I noted yet I none could see
But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee
Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem
In gentle numbers time so idly spent
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument
Rise resty Muse my love sweet face survey
If Time have any wrinkle graven there
If any be a satire to decay
And make time spoils despised every where
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life
So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd
Both truth and beauty on my love depends
So dost thou too and therein dignified
Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say
'Truth needs no colour with his colour fix'd
Beauty no pencil beauty truth to lay
But best is best if never intermix'd'
Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
Excuse not silence so for't lies in thee
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
And to be prais'd of ages yet to be
Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how
To make him seem long hence as he shows now
My love is strengthen'd though more weak in seeming
I love not less though less the show appear
That love is merchandiz'd whose rich esteeming
The owner tongue doth publish every where
Our love was new and then but in the spring
When I was wont to greet it with my lays
As Philomel in summer front doth sing
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
But that wild music burthens every bough
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
Because I would not dull you with my song
Alack what poverty my Muse brings forth
That having such a scope to show her pride
The argument all bare is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside
O blame me not if I no more can write
Look in your glass and there appears a face
That over-goes my blunt invention quite
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
Were it not sinful then striving to mend
To mar the subject that before was well
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
And more much more than in my verse can sit
Your own glass shows you when you look in it
To me fair friend you never can be old
For as you were when first your eye I ey'd
Such seems your beauty still Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
In process of the seasons have I seen
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
Ah yet doth beauty like a dial-hand
Steal from his figure and no pace perceiv'd
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceiv'd
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
Ere you were born was beauty summer dead
Let not my love be call'd idolatry
Nor my beloved as an idol show
Since all alike my songs and praises be
To one of one still such and ever so
Kind is my love to-day to-morrow kind
Still constant in a wondrous excellence
Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd
One thing expressing leaves out difference
'Fair kind and true' is all my argument
'Fair kind and true' varying to other words
And in this change is my invention spent
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
Fair kind and true have often liv'd alone
Which three till now never kept seat in one
When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
And beauty making beautiful old rime
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty best
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
I see their antique pen would have express'd
Even such a beauty as you master now
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time all you prefiguring
And for they looked but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
For we which now behold these present days
Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control
Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd
And the sad augurs mock their own presage
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd
And peace proclaims olives of endless age
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh and Death to me subscribes
Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rime
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
And thou in this shalt find thy monument
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent
What in the brain that ink may character
Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit
What new to speak what now to register
That may express my love or thy dear merit
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
I must each day say o'er the very same
Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name
So that eternal love in love fresh case
Weighs not the dust and injury of age
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
But makes antiquity for aye his page
Finding the first conceit of love there bred
Where time and outward form would show it dead
O never say that I was false of heart
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify
As easy might I from my self depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
That is my home of love if I have rang'd
Like him that travels I return again
Just to the time not with the time exchang'd
So that myself bring water for my stain
Never believe though in my nature reign'd
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
That it could so preposterously be stain'd
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
For nothing this wide universe I call
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all
Alas 'tis true I have gone here and there
And made my self a motley to the view
Gor'd mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
Made old offences of affections new
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
Askance and strangely but by all above
These blenches gave my heart another youth
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love
Now all is done save what shall have no end
Mine appetite I never more will grind
On newer proof to try an older friend
A god in love to whom I am confin'd
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
To what it works in like the dyer hand
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
No bitterness that I will bitter think
Nor double penance to correct correction
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me
Your love and pity doth the impression fill
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow
For what care I who calls me well or ill
So you o'er-green my bad my good allow
You are my all-the-world and I must strive
To know my shames and praises from your tongue
None else to me nor I to none alive
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong
In so profound abysm I throw all care
Of others' voices that my adder sense
To critic and to flatterer stopped are
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
You are so strongly in my purpose bred
That all the world besides methinks are dead
Since I left you mine eye is in my mind
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function and is partly blind
Seems seeing but effectually is out
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
The mountain or the sea the day or night
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
Incapable of more replete with you
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
Or whether doth my mind being crown'd with you
Drink up the monarch plague this flattery
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true
And that your love taught it this alchemy
To make of monsters and things indigest
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
Creating every bad a perfect best
As fast as objects to his beams assemble
O 'tis the first 'tis flattery in my seeing
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing
And to his palate doth prepare the cup
If it be poison'd 'tis the lesser sin
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin
Those lines that I before have writ do lie
Even those that said I could not love you dearer
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
But reckoning Time whose million'd accidents
Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings
Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things
Alas why fearing of Time tyranny
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best
When I was certain o'er incertainty
Crowning the present doubting of the rest
Love is a babe then might I not say so
To give full growth to that which still doth grow
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandering bark
Whose worth unknown although his height be taken
Love not Time fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me prov'd
I never writ nor no man ever lov'd
Accuse me thus that I have scanted all
Wherein I should your great deserts repay
Forgot upon your dearest love to call
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
That I have frequent been with unknown minds
And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Which should transport me farthest from your sight
Book both my wilfulness and errors down
And on just proof surmise accumulate
Bring me within the level of your frown
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
The constancy and virtue of your love
Like as to make our appetite more keen
With eager compounds we our palate urge
As to prevent our maladies unseen
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge
Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
To be diseas'd ere that there was true needing
Thus policy in love to anticipate
The ills that were not grew to faults assur'd
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cur'd
But thence I learn and find the lesson true
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
Still losing when I saw myself to win
What wretched errors hath my heart committed
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
In the distraction of this madding fever
O benefit of ill now I find true
That better is by evil still made better
And ruin'd love when it is built anew
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
So I return rebuk'd to my content
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent
That you were once unkind befriends me now
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
As I by yours you've pass'd a hell of time
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffer'd in your crime
O that our night of woe might have remember'd
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
And soon to you as you to me then tender'd
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
But that your trespass now becomes a fee
Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd
When not to be receives reproach of being
And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing
For why should others' false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies
Which in their wills count bad what I think good
No I am that I am and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
Unless this general evil they maintain
All men are bad and in their badness reign
Thy gift thy tables are within my brain
Full character'd with lasting memory
Which shall above that idle rank remain
Beyond all date even to eternity
Or at the least so long as brain and heart
Have faculty by nature to subsist
Till each to raz'd oblivion yield his part
Of thee thy record never can be miss'd
That poor retention could not so much hold
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
Therefore to give them from me was I bold
To trust those tables that receive thee more
To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Were to import forgetfulness in me
No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel nothing strange
They are but dressings of a former sight
Our dates are brief and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told
Thy registers and thee I both defy
Not wondering at the present nor the past
For thy records and what we see doth lie
Made more or less by thy continual haste
This I do vow and this shall ever be
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee
If my dear love were but the child of state
It might for Fortune bastard be unfather'd
As subject to Time love or to Time hate
Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gather'd
No it was builded far from accident
It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
Under the blow of thralled discontent
Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls
It fears not policy that heretic
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours
But all alone stands hugely politic
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
To this I witness call the fools of time
Which die for goodness who have lived for crime
Were't aught to me I bore the canopy
With my extern the outward honouring
Or laid great bases for eternity
Which proves more short than waste or ruining
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Lose all and more by paying too much rent
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
No let me be obsequious in thy heart
And take thou my oblation poor but free
Which is not mix'd with seconds knows no art
But mutual render only me for thee
Hence thou suborned informer a true soul
When most impeach'd stands least in thy control
O thou my lovely boy who in thy power
Dost hold Time fickle glass his fickle hour
Who hast by waning grown and therein show'st
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure
She may detain but not still keep her treasure
Her audit though delayed answered must be
And her quietus is to render thee
In the old age black was not counted fair
Or if it were it bore not beauty name
But now is black beauty successive heir
And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame
For since each hand hath put on Nature power
Fairing the foul with Art false borrowed face
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
But is profan'd if not lives in disgrace
Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
At such who not born fair no beauty lack
Sland'ring creation with a false esteem
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
That every tongue says beauty should look so
How oft when thou my music music play'st
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
At the wood boldness by thee blushing stand
To be so tickled they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action and till action lust
Is perjur'd murderous bloody full of blame
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallow'd bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
Had having and in quest to have extreme
A bliss in proof  and prov'd a very woe
Before a joy propos'd behind a dream
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun
Coral is far more red than her lips red
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
I have seen roses damask'd red and white
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
I love to hear her speak yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
I grant I never saw a goddess go 
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
To say they err I dare not be so bold
Although I swear it to myself alone
And to be sure that is not false I swear
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
One on another neck do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgment place
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
And thence this slander as I think proceeds
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
Have put on black and loving mourners be
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
And suit thy pity like in every part
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
Is't not enough to torture me alone
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd
Of him myself and thee I am forsaken
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom ward
But then my friend heart let my poor heart bail
Whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
Perforce am thine and all that is in me
So now I have confess'd that he is thine
And I my self am mortgag'd to thy will
Myself I'll forfeit so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
For thou art covetous and he is kind
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
Thou usurer that putt'st forth all to use
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole and yet am I not free
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy 'Will
And 'Will' to boot and 'Will' in over-plus
More than enough am I that vex'd thee still
To thy sweet will making addition thus
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
Shall will in others seem right gracious
And in my will no fair acceptance shine
The sea all water yet receives rain still
And in abundance addeth to his store
So thou being rich in 'Will' add to thy 'Will
One will of mine to make thy large will more
Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill
Think all but one and me in that one 'Will
If thy soul check thee that I come so near
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will'
And will thy soul knows is admitted there
Thus far for love my love-suit sweet fulfil
'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
In things of great receipt with ease we prove
Among a number one is reckon'd none
Then in the number let me pass untold
Though in thy store account I one must be
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
Make but my name thy love and love that still
And then thou lov'st me for my name is 'Will
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see
They know what beauty is see where it lies
Yet what the best is take the worst to be
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide world common place
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd
And to this false plague are they now transferr'd
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutor'd youth
Unlearned in the world false subtleties
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Although she knows my days are past the best
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
But wherefore says she not she is unjust
And wherefore say not I that I am old
O love best habit is in seeming trust
And age in love loves not to have years told
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be
O call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Use power with power and slay me not by art
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere but in my sight
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my o'erpress'd defence can bide
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
And therefore from my face she turns my foes
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Yet do not so but since I am near slain
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
The manner of my pity-wanting pain
If I might teach thee wit better it were
Though not to love yet love to tell me so 
As testy sick men when their deaths be near
No news but health from their physicians know 
For if I should despair I should grow mad
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
That I may not be so nor thou belied
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
For they in thee a thousand errors note
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue tune delighted
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone
Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man
Thy proud heart slave and vassal wretch to be
Only my plague thus far I count my gain
That she that makes me sin awards me pain
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
O but with mine compare thou thine own state
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
Or if it do not from those lips of thine
That have profan'd their scarlet ornaments
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
By self-example mayst thou be denied
Lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
One of her feather'd creatures broke away
Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face
Not prizing her poor infant discontent
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
And play the mother part kiss me be kind
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will
If thou turn back and my loud crying still
Two loves I have of comfort and despair
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The better angel is a man right fair
The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill
To win me soon to hell my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
Wooing his purity with her foul pride
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
Suspect I may yet not directly tell
But being both from me both to each friend
I guess one angel in another hell
Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out
Those lips that Love own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
To me that languish'd for her sake
But when she saw my woeful state
Straight in her heart did mercy come
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was us'd in giving gentle doom
And taught it thus anew to greet
'I hate' she alter'd with an end
That followed it as gentle day
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away
'I hate' from hate away she threw
And sav'd my life saying 'not you'
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
My sinful earth these rebel powers array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Eat up thy charge Is this thy body end
Then soul live thou upon thy servant loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shall thou feed on Death that feeds on men
And Death once dead there no more dying then
My love is as a fever longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
The uncertain sickly appetite to please
My reason the physician to my love
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
Hath left me and I desperate now approve
Desire is death which physic did except
Past cure I am now Reason is past care
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen are
At random from the truth vainly express'd
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
Who art as black as hell as dark as night
O me what eyes hath Love put in my head
Which have no correspondence with true sight
Or if they have where is my judgment fled
That censures falsely what they see aright
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
What means the world to say it is not so
If it be not then love doth well denote
Love eye is not so true as all men no
How can it O how can Love eye be true
That is so vexed with watching and with tears
No marvel then though I mistake my view
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears
O cunning Love with tears thou keep'st me blind
Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find
Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
Am of my self all tyrant for thy sake
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon
Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
Revenge upon myself with present moan
What merit do I in my self respect
That is so proud thy service to despise
When all my best doth worship thy defect
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
But love hate on for now I know thy mind
Those that can see thou lov'st and I am blind
O from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway
To make me give the lie to my true sight
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantise of skill
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate
O though I love what others do abhor
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
If thy unworthiness rais'd love in me
More worthy I to be belov'd of thee
Love is too young to know what conscience is
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
For thou betraying me I do betray
My nobler part to my gross body treason
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
But rising at thy name doth point out thee
As his triumphant prize Proud of this pride
He is contented thy poor drudge to be
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
No want of conscience hold it that I call
Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn
In vowing new hate after new love bearing
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee
When I break twenty I am perjur'd most
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
And all my honest faith in thee is lost
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
Or made them swear against the thing they see
For I have sworn thee fair more perjur'd I
To swear against the truth so foul a lie
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
A maid of Dian this advantage found
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat still to endure
And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
But at my mistress' eye Love brand new-fired
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
I sick withal the help of bath desired
And thither hied a sad distemper'd guest
But found no cure the bath for my help lies
Where Cupid got new fire my mistress' eyes
The little Love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd
This brand she quenched in a cool well by
Which from Love fire took heat perpetual
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseas'd but I my mistress' thrall
Came there for cure and this by that I prove
Love fire heats water water cools not love
The sonne hath twise brought furth his tender grene
And clad the earth in liuely lustinesse
Ones haue the windes the trees despoiled clene
And new again begins their cruelnesse
Since I haue hid vnder my brest the harm
That neuer shall recouer healthfulnesse
The winters hurt recouers with the warm
The parched grene restored is with shade
What warmth alas may serue for to disarm
The frosen hart that mine in flame hath made
What colde againe is able to restore
My fresh grene yeares that wither thus and fade
Alas I se nothing hath hurt so sore
But time in time reduceth a returne
In time my harm increaseth more and more
And semes to haue my cure alwaies in scorne
Strange kindes of death in life that I doe trie
At hand to melt farre of in flame to burne
And like as time list to my cure aply
So doth eche place my comfort cleane refuse
All thing aliue that seeth the heauens with eye
With cloke of night may couer and excuse
It self from trauail of the dayes vnrest
Saue I alas against all others vse
That then stirre vp the tormentes of my brest
And curse eche sterre as causer of my fate
And when the sonne hath eke the dark opprest
And brought the day it doth nothing abate
The trauailes of mine endles smart and payn
For then as one that hath the light in hate
I wish for night more couertly to playn
And me withdraw from euery haunted place
Lest by my chere my chance appere to playn
And in my minde I measure pace by pace
To seke the place where I my self had lost
That day that I was tangled in the lace
In semyng slack that knitteth euer most
But neuer yet the trauaile of my thought
Of better state coulde catche a cause to bost
For if I found sometime that I haue sought
Those sterres by whome I trusted of the porte
My sayles doe fall and I aduance right nought
As ankerd fast my spretes doe all resorte
To stande agazed and sinke in more and more
The deadly harme which she dothe take in sport
Lo if I seke how I doe finde my sore
And yf I flee I carie with me still
The venomde shaft whiche dothe his force restore
By hast of flight and I may plaine my fill
Vnto my selfe vnlesse this carefull song
Printe in your harte some parcell of my tene
For I alas in silence all to long
Of myne olde hurte yet fele the wounde but grene
Rue on my life or els your cruell wronge
Shall well appere and by my death be sene
The soote season that bud and blome furth bringes
With grene hath clad the hill and eke the vale
The nightingale with fethers new she singes
The turtle to her make hath tolde her tale
Somer is come for euery spray nowe springes
The hart hath hong his olde hed on the pale
The buck in brake his winter cote he flinges
The fishes flote with newe repaired scale
The adder all her sloughe awaye she slinges
The swift swalow pursueth the flyes smale
The busy bee her honye now she minges
Winter is worne that was the flowers bale
And thus I see among these pleasant thinges
Eche care decayes and yet my sorow springes
Loue that liueth and reigneth in my thought
That built his seat within my captiue brest
Clad in the armes wherin with me he fought
Oft in my face he doth his banner rest
She that me taught to loue and suffer payne
My doutfull hope and eke my hote desyre
With shamefast cloke to shadowe and refraine
Her smilyng grace conuerteth straight to yre
And cowarde Loue then to the hart apace
Taketh his flight whereas he lurkes and plaines
His purpose lost and dare not shewe his face
For my lordes gilt thus faultlesse byde I paynes
Yet from my lorde shall not my foote remoue
Swete is his death that takes his end by loue
In Ciprus springes whereas dame Venus dwelt
A well so hote that whoso tastes thesame
Were he of stone as thawed yse should melt
And kindled fynde his brest with fired flame
Whose moyst poyson dissolued hath my hate
This creeping fire my colde lims so opprest
That in the hart that harborde freedome late
Endlesse despeyre longe thraldome hath imprest
An other so colde in frozen yse is founde
Whose chilling venom of repugnant kynde
The feruent heat doth quenche of Cupides wounde
And with the spot of change infectes the minde
Whereof my dere hath tasted to my paine
My seruice thus is growen into disdaine
From Tuskane came my Ladies worthy race
Faire Florence was sometyme her auncient seate
The Western yle whose pleasaunt shore dothe face
Wilde Cambers clifs did geue her liuely heate
Fostered she was with milke of Irishe brest
Her sire an Erle her dame of princes blood
From tender yeres in Britain she doth rest
With kinges childe where she tasteth costly food
Honsdon did first present her to mine yien
Bright is her hewe and Geraldine she hight
Hampton me taught to wishe her first for mine
And Windsor alas dothe chase me from her sight
Her beauty of kind her vertues from aboue
Happy is he that can obtaine her loue
Brittle beautie that nature made so fraile
Wherof the gift is small and short the season
Flowring to day to morowe apt to faile
Tickell treasure abhorred of reason
Daungerous to dele with vaine of none auaile
Costly in keping past not worthe two peason
Slipper in sliding as is an eles taile
Harde to attaine once gotten not geason
Iewel of ieopardie that perill dothe assaile
False and vntrue enticed oft to treason
Enmy to youth that moste may I bewaile
Ah bitter swete infecting as the poyson
Thou farest as frute that with the frost is taken
To day redy ripe to morowe all to shaken
Alas so all thinges nowe doe holde their peace
Heauen and earth disturbed in nothing
The beastes the ayer the birdes their song doe cease
The nightes chare the starres aboute dothe bring
Calme is the Sea the waues worke lesse and lesse
So am not I whom loue alas doth wring
Bringing before my face the great encrease
Of my desires whereat I wepe and syng
In ioye and wo as in a doutfull ease
For my swete thoughtes sometyme doe pleasure bring
Geues me a pang that inwardly dothe sting
When that I thinke what griefe it is againe
To liue and lacke the thing should ridde my paine
When Windsor walles susteyned my wearied arme
My hande my chin to ease my restlesse hed
The pleasant plot reuested green with warme
The blossomd bowes with lusty Ver yspred
The flowred meades the wedded birdes so late
Mine eyes discouer and to my mynde resorte
The ioly woes the hatelesse shorte debate
The rakehell lyfe that longes to loues disporte
Wherewith alas the heauy charge of care
Heapt in my brest breakes forth against my will
In smoky sighes that ouercast the ayer
My vapord eyes suche drery teares distill
The tender spring whiche quicken where they fall
And I halfebent to throwe me downe withall
Set me wheras the sunne doth parche the grene
Or where his beames do not dissolue the yse
In temperate heate where he is felt and sene
In presence prest of people madde or wise
Set me in hye or yet in lowe degree
In longest night or in the shortest daye
In clearest skye or where clowdes thickest be
In lusty youth or when my heeres are graye
Set me in heauen in earth or els in hell
In hyll or dale or in the fomyng flood
Thrall or at large aliue where so I dwell
Sicke or in health in euyll fame or good
Hers will I be and onely with this thought
Content my selfe although my chaunce be nought
I Neuer sawe my Ladye laye apart
Her cornet blacke in colde nor yet in heate
Sith first she knew my griefe was growen so great
Which other fansies driueth from my hart
That to my selfe I do the thought reserue
The which vnwares did wounde my wofull brest
But on her face mine eyes mought neuer rest
Yet sins she knew I did her loue and serue
Her golden tresses cladde alway with blacke
Her smilyng lokes that hid thus euermore
And that restraines whiche I desire so sore
So dothe this cornet gouerne me alacke
In somer sunne in winters breath a frost
Wherby the light of her faire lokes I lost
The golden gift that nature did thee geue
To fasten frendes and fede them at thy wyll
With fourme and fauour taught me to beleue
How thou art made to shew her greatest skill
Whose hidden vertues are not so vnknowen
But liuely domes might gather at the first
Where beautye so her perfect seede hath sowen
Of other graces folow nedes there must
Now certesse Ladie sins all this is true
That from aboue thy gyftes are thus elect
Do not deface them than with fansies newe
Nor chaunge of mindes let not thy minde infect
But mercy him thy frende that doth thee serue
Who seekes alway thine honour to preserue
So cruell prison how coulde betide alas
As proude Windsor where I in lust and ioye
With a kinges sonne my childishe yeres did passe
In greater feast than Priams sonnes of Troy
Where eche swete place returns a taste full sower
The large grene courtes where we were wont to houe
With eyes cast vp into the maydens tower
And easie sighes suche as folke drawe in loue
The stately seates the ladies bright of hewe
The daunces shorte longe tales of great delight
With wordes and lokes that tygers coulde but rewe
Where eche of vs did pleade the others right
The palme play where dispoyled for the game
With dazed eies oft we by gleames of loue
Haue mist the ball and got sight of our dame
To baite her eyes whiche kept the leads aboue
The grauell grounde with sleues tyed on the helme
On fomynge horse with swordes and frendlye hartes
With cheare as though one should another whelme
Where we haue fought and chased oft with dartes
With siluer droppes the meade yet spred for ruthe
In actiue games of nimblenes and strength
Where we did straine trayned with swarmes of youth
Our tender lymmes that yet shot vp in length
The secrete groues which oft we made resounde
Of pleasaunt playnt and of our ladies prayse
Recordyng ofte what grace eche one had founde
What hope of spede what dreade of long delayes
The wilde forest the clothed holtes with grene
With rayns auailed and swift ybreathed horse
With crye of houndes and mery blastes betwene
Where we did chase the fearfull harte of force
The wide vales eke that harborde vs ech night
Wherwith alas reuiueth in my brest
The swete accorde such slepes as yet delight
The pleasant dreames the quiet bed of rest
The secrete thoughtes imparted with such trust
The wanton talke the diuers change of play
The frendship sworne eche promise kept so iust
Wherwith we past the winter night away
And with this thought the bloud forsakes the face
The teares berayne my chekes of deadly hewe
The whiche as sone as sobbyng sighes alas
Vpsupped haue thus I my plaint renewe
O place of blisse renuer of my woes
Geue me accompt where is my noble fere
Whom in thy walles thou doest eche night enclose
To other leefe but vnto me most dere
Eccho alas that dothe my sorow rewe
Returns therto a hollow sounde of playnte
Thus I alone where all my fredome grewe
In prison pyne with bondage and restrainte
And with remembrance of the greater greefe
To banishe the lesse I find my chief releefe
Of thy lyfe Thomas this compasse well mark
Not aye with full sayles the hye seas to beat
Ne by coward dred in shonning stormes dark
On shalow shores thy keel in perill freat
Who so gladly halseth the golden meane
Voyde of dangers aduisdly hath his home
Not with lothsom muck as a den vncleane
Nor palacelyke wherat disdayn may glome
The lofty pyne the great winde often riues
With violenter swey falne turrets stepe
Lightninges assault the hye mountains and cliues
A hart well stayd in ouerthwartes depe
Hopeth amendes in swete doth feare the sowre
God that sendeth withdraweth winter sharp
Now ill not aye thus once Phebus to lowre
With bow vnbent shall cesse and frame to harp
His voyce In straite estate appere thou stout
And so wisely when lucky gale of winde
All thy puft sailes shall fil loke well about
Take in a ryft hast is wast profe doth finde
The great Macedon that out of Persie chased
Darius of whose huge power all Asie rong
In the rich ark dan Homers rimes he placed
Who fayned gestes of heathen princes song
What holy graue what worthy sepulture
To Wiattes Psalmes should Christians then purchase
Where he doth paint the liuely faith and pure
The stedfast hope the swete returne to grace
Of iust Dauid by perfite penitence
Where rulers may se in a mirrour clere
The bitter frute of false concupiscence
How Iewry bought Vrias death full dere
In princes hartes gods scourge imprinted depe
Ought them awake out of their sinfull slepe
Dyuers thy death doe diuersly bemone
Some that in presence of thy liuelyhed
Lurked whose brestes enuy with hate had swolne
Yeld Ceasars teares vpon Pompeius hed
Some that watched with the murdrers knife
With egre thirst to drink thy giltlesse blood
Whose practise brake by happy ende of lyfe
Wepe enuious teares to heare thy fame so good
But I that knew what harbred in that hed
What vertues rare were temperd in that brest
Honour the place that such a iewell bred
And kisse the ground whereas thy corse doth rest
With vapord eyes from whence such streames auayl
As Pyramus dyd on Thisbes brest bewail
Yea and a good cause why thus should I playn
For what is hee can quietly sustayn
So great a grief with mouth as styll as stone
My loue my lyfe of ioye my ieewell is gone
This harty zeale if any wight disprooue
As womans work whom feeble minde doth mooue
Hee neither knowes the mighty natures laws
Nor touching elders deeds hath seen old saws
Martius to vanquish Rome was set on fire
But vanquisht fell at moothers boon his ire
Into Hesperian land Sertorius fled
Of parent aye cheef care had in his hed
Dear weight on shoulders Sicil brethren bore
While Etnaes gyant spouted flames full sore
Not more of Tyndars ymps hath Sparta spoke
Than Arge of charged necks with parents yoke
Nor onely them thus dyd foretyme entreat
Then was the noorsse also in honour great
Caiet the Phrygian from amid fireflame
Rescued who gaue to Latine stronds the name
Acca in dubble sense Lupa ycleaped
To Romane Calendars a feast hath heaped
His Capra Ioue among the sterres hath pight
In welkin clere yet lo she shineth bryght
Hyades as gratefully Lyai did place
Whom in primetide supports the Bulls fayr face
And should not I expresse my inward wo
When you most louyng dam so soon hence go
I in your frutefull woomb conceyued born was
Whyle wanderyng moon ten moonths did ouerpasse
Mee brought to light your tender arms sustaynd
And with my lips your milky paps I straynd
You mee embraced in bosom soft you mee
Cherished as I your onely chylde had bee
Of yssue fayr with noombers were you blest
Yet I the bestbeloued of all the rest
Good luck certayn forereadyng moothers haue
And you of mee a speciall iudgement gaue
Then when firm pase I fixed on the ground
When toung gan cease to break the lispyng sound
You mee streightway did too the Muses send
Ne suffered long a loytervng lyfe to spend
What gayn the wooll what gayn the wed had braught
It was his meed that me there dayly taught
When with Minerue I had acquaintance woon
And Phebus seemd to loue mee as his soon
Browns hold I bad at parents hest farewell
And gladly there in schools I gan to dwell
Where Granta giues the ladies nyne such place
That they reioyse to see theyr blisfull case
With ioyes at hert in this pernasse I bode
Whyle through his signes fiue tymes great Titan glode
And twyse as long by that fayr foord whereas
Swanfeeder Temms no furder course can passe
O what desire had you therwhile of mee
Mid doutfull dreeds what ioyes were wont to bee
Now linnen clothes wrought with those fyngers fyne
Now other thynges of yours dyd you make myne
Tyll your last thredes gan Clotho to vntwyne
And of your dayes the date extreem assygne
Hearyng the chaunce your neybours made much mone
A dearworth dame they thought theyr coomfort gone
Kinswoomen wept your charge the maydens wept
Your daughters wept whom you so well had kept
But my good syre gaue with soft woords releef
And clokes with outward chere his inward greef
Leste by his care your sicknes should augment
And on his case your thoughtfull hert be bent
You not forgetting yet a moothers mood
When at the dore dartthirling death there stood
Did saye Adeew dear spouse my race is roon
Wher so he bee I haue left you a soon
And Nicolas you naamd and naamd agayn
With other speech aspiring heauenly raign
When into ayre your sprite departed fled
And left the corps a cold in lukewarm bed
Ah could you thus deare mother leaue vs all
Now should you liue that yet before your fall
My songs you might haue soong haue heard my voyce
And in commodities of your own reioyce
My sisters yet vnwedded who shall guide
With whose good lessons shall they bee applyed
Haue mother monumentes of our sore smart
No costly tomb areard with curious art
Nor Mausolean masse hoong in the ayre
Nor loftie steeples that will once appayre
But waylful verse and doolfull song accept
By verse the names of auncient peres be kept
By verse liues Hercules by verse Achil
Hector Ene by verse be famous still
Closde with good end good life is woont to bee
But now my sacred parent fare you well
God shall cause vs agayn togither dwell
What time this vniuersall globe shall hear
Of the last troomp the rynging voyce great fear
To soom to such as you a heauenly chear
Til then reposde rest you in gentle sleep
While hee whom to you are bequeathd you keep
Now clattering arms now ragyng broyls of warr
Gan passe the noyes of taratantars clang
Shrowded with shafts the heuen with clowd of darts
Couered the ayre against fulfatted bulls
As forceth kindled ire the Lions keen
Whose greedy gutts the gnawing hoonger pricks
So Macedoins against the Persians fare
Now corpses hide the purpurde soyl with blood
Large slaughter on ech side but Perses more
Moyst feelds bebledd their herts and noombers bate
Fainted while they giue back and fall to flight
The lightning Macedon by swoords by gleaus
By bands and trowps of fotemen with his garde
Speeds to Darie but him his nearest kyn
Oxate preserues with horsemen on a plump
Before his cart that none the charge could giue
Here grunts here grones echwhere strong youth is spent
Shaking her bloody hands Bellone among
The Perses soweth all kindes of cruel death
With throte ycutt hee roores hee lyeth along
His entrails with a launce through girded quite
Him down the club him beats farstryking bowe
And him the slyng and him the shinand swoord
Hee dieth hee is all dedd hee pants hee rests
Right ouer stood in snowwhite armour braue
The Memphite Zoroas a cooning clerk
To whom the heauen lay open as his book
And in celestiall bodyes hee could tell
The moouyng meetyng light aspect eclyps
And influence and constellations all
What earthly chaunces wold betide what yere
Of plenty storde what signe forwarned derth
How winter gendreth snow what temperature
In the primetide dothe season well the soyl
Why soomer burns why autum hath ripe grapes
Whether the circle quadrate may becoom
Whether our tunes heauens harmony can yeeld
Of fowr begynns among them selues how great
Proportion is what swaye the erring lightes
Dothe send in course gayn that first moouing heauen
What grees one from an other distant bee
What sterr dothe lett the hurtfull fire to rage
Or him more mylde what opposition makes
What fire dothe qualifie Mauorses fire
What house echone doth seek what planet raigns
Within this hemisphere or that small things
I speak holl heauen hee closeth in his brest
This sage then in the starrs had spied the fates
Threatned him death without delaye and sithe
Hee saw hee could not fatall order change
Forward hee preast in battayl that hee might
Meet with the ruler of the Macedoins
Of his right hand desirous to be slayn
The boldest beurn and worthiest in the feeld
And as a wight now weary of his life
And seeking death in first front of his rage
Cooms desperatly to Alisanders face
At him with darts one after other throwes
With reckles woords and clamour him prouokes
And sayth Nectanabs bastard shameful stain
Of mothers bed why losest thou thy strokes
Cowards emong Turn thee to mee in case
Manhod ther bee so much left in thy hert
Coom fight with mee that on my helmet wear
Apolloes laurel bothe for learnings laude
And eke for Martiall prayse that in my shield
The seuenfold sophie of Minerue contein
A match more meet sir king than any here
The noble prince amoued takes ruthe vpon
The wilfull wight and with soft woords ayen
O monstrous man quod he whatso thou art
I praye thee lyue ne do not with thy death
This lodge of lore the Muses mansion marr
That treasure house this hand shall neuer spoyl
My swoord shall neuer bruze that skylfull brayn
Longgatherd heapes of science soon to spyll
O how faire frutes may you to mortall men
From wisdoms garden giue How many may
By you the wyser and the better proue
What error what mad moode what phrenzey thee
Persuades to bee downsent to deep Auern
Where no artes florish nor no knowledge vails
For all these sawes when thus the souerain sayde
Alighted Zoroas with swoord vnsheathed
The carelesse king there smote aboue the greaue
At thopening of his quishes wounded him
So that the blood down reyled on the ground
The Macedon perceyuing hurt gan gnash
But yet his minde he bent in any wyse
Hym to forbear set spurrs vnto his steed
And turnd away leste anger of the smart
Should cause reuenger hand deal balefull blowes
But of the Macedonian chieftanes knights
One Meleager could not bear this sight
But ran vpon the sayd Egyptian renk
And cut him in both kneez hee fell to ground
Wherwith a hole route came of souldiours stern
And all in peeces hewed the silly seg
But happyly the soll fled to the sterres
Where vnder him he hath full sight of all
Wherat hee gazed here with reaching looke
The Persians wayld such sapience to forgo
The very fone the Macedonians wisht
Hee wold haue lyued kyng Alisander self
Deemd him a man vnmeet to dye at all
Who woon lyke prayse for conquest of his ire
As for stout men in feeld that daye subdeewd
Who princes taught how to discern a man
That in his hed so rare a iewell beares
But ouer all those same Camenes those same
Diuine Camenes whose honour he procurde
As tender parent dothe his daughters weal
Do cherish him deceast and set hym free
From derk obliuion of deuouryng death
Therfore when restlesse rage of wynde and waue
Hee saw By fates alas calld for quod hee
Is haplesse Cicero sayl on shape course
To the next shore and bryng me to my death
Perdie these thanks reskued from ciuil swoord
Wilt thou my countrey paye I see mine end
So powrs diuine so bid the gods aboue
In citie saued that Consul Marcus shend
Great grones euen at the name of Room reherst
His yies and cheeks with showrs of teares hee washt
And though a route in dayly daungers worn
With forced face the shipmen held theyr teares
And striuyng long the seas rough floods to passe
In angry wyndes and stormy stowrs made waye
And at the last safe anchord in the rode
Came heauy Cicero a land with payn
His faynted lyms the aged sire dothe draw
And round about their master stood his band
Nor greatly with theyr own hard hap dismayd
Nor plighted fayth prone in sharp time to break
Soom swoords prepare soom theyr deare lord assist
In littour layd they lead hym vnkouth wayes
If so deceaue Antonius cruell gleaus
They might and threats of folowing routs escape
Thus lo that Tullie went that Tullius
Of royall robe and sacred Senate prince
When hee afar the men approche espyeth
And of his fone the ensignes dothe aknow
And with drawn swoord Popilius threatnyng death
Whose life and holl estate in hazard once
Hee had preserud when Room as yet to free
Herd hym and at his thundryng voyce amazde
Herennius eek more eyger than the rest
Present enflamde with furie him purseews
What might hee doo Should hee vse in defense
Disarmed hands or pardon ask for meed
Should hee with woords attempt to turn the wrath
Of tharmed knyght whose safegard hee had wrought
No age forbids and fixt within deep brest
His countreys loue and falling Rooms image
The charret turn sayth hee let loose the rayns
Roon to the vndeserued death mee lo
Hath Phebus fowl as messanger forwarnd
And Ioue desires a neew heauensman to make
Brutus and Cassius soulls liue you in blisse
In case yet all the fates gaynstriue vs not
Neyther shall wee perchaunce dye vnreuenged
Now haue I liued O Room ynough for mee
My passed lyfe nought suffreth mee to dout
Noysom obliuion of the lothesom death
Slea mee yet all thofspring to coom shall know
And this deceas shall bring eternall lyfe
Yea and onlesse I fayl and all in vain
Room I soomtyme thy Augur chosen was
Not euermore shall frendly fortune thee
Fauour Antonius once the day shall coom
When her deare wights by cruell spight thus slayn
Victorious Room shall at thy hands require
Mee likes therwhyle go see the hoped heauen
Speech had he left and therwith hee good man
His throte preparde and held his hed vnmoued
His hastyng too those fates the very knights
Be lothe to see and rage rebated when
They his bare neck beheld and his hore heyres
Scant could they hold the teares that forth gan burst
And almost fell from bloody hands the swoords
Onely the stern Herennius with grym look
Dastards why stand you styll he sayth and streight
Swaps of the hed with his presumptuous yron
Ne with that slaughter yet is hee not fild
Fowl shame on shame to heap is his delyte
Wherfore the hands also doth hee of smyte
Which durst Antonius life so liuely paynt
Him yeldyng strayned goste from welkin hye
With lothly chere lord Phebus gan behold
And in black clowd they saye long hid his hed
The latine Muses and the Grayes they wept
And for his fall eternally shall weep
And lo hertpersyng Pitho straunge to tell
Who had to him suffisde bothe sense and woords
When so he spake and drest with nectar soote
That flowyng toung when his wyndpype disclosde
Fled with her fleeyng frend and out alas
Hath left the erth ne wil nomore
Popilius flyeth therwhyle and leauyng there
The senslesse stock a gryzely sight doth bear
Vnto Antonius boord with mischief fed
