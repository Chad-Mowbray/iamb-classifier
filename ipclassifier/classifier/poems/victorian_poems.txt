One lesson Nature let me learn of thee
One lesson which in every wind is blown
One lesson of two duties kept at one
Though the loud world proclaim their enmity 
Of toil unsevered from tranquillity
Of labor that in lasting fruit outgrows
Far noisier schemes accomplished in repose
Too great for haste too high for rivalry
Yes while on earth a thousand discords ring
Man senseless uproar mingling with his toil
Still do thy quiet ministers move on
Their glorious tasks in silence perfecting
Still working blaming still our vain turmoil
Laborers that shall not fail when man is gone
Who prop thou ask'st in these bad days my mind 
He much the old man who clearest-souled of men
Saw The Wide Prospect and the Asian Fen
And Tmolus hill and Smyrna bay though blind
Much he whose friendship I not long since won
That halting slave who in Nicopolis
Taught Arrian when Vespasian brutal son
Cleared Rome of what most shamed him But be his
My special thanks whose even-balanced soul
From first youth tested up to extreme old age
Business could not make dull nor passion wild
Who saw life steadily and saw it whole
The mellow glory of the Attic stage
Singer of sweet Colonus and its child
O monstrous dead unprofitable world
That thou canst hear and hearing hold thy way
A voice oracular hath pealed to-day
To-day a hero banner is unfurled
Hast thou no lip for welcome So I said
Man after man the world smiled and passed by
A smile of wistful incredulity
As though one spake of life unto the dead 
Scornful and strange and sorrowful and full
Of bitter knowledge Yet the will is free
Strong is the soul and wise and beautiful
The seeds of godlike power are in us still
Gods are we bards saints heroes if we will 
Dumb judges answer truth or mockery
Affections Instincts Principles and Powers
Impulse and Reason Freedom and Control 
So men unravelling God harmonious whole
Rend in a thousand shreds this life of ours
Vain labor Deep and broad where none may see
Spring the foundations of that shadowy throne
Where man one nature queen-like sits alone
Centred in a majestic unity
And rays her powers like sister-islands seen
Linking their coral arms under the sea
Or clustered peaks with plunging gulfs between
Spanned by aerial arches all of gold
Whereo'er the chariot-wheels of life are rolled
In cloudy circles to eternity
Because thou hast believed the wheels of life
Stand never idle but go always round
Not by their hands who vex the patient ground
Moved only but by genius in the strife
Of all its chafing torrents after thaw
Urged and to feed whose movement spinning sand
The feeble sons of pleasure set their hand
And in this vision of the general law
Hast labored but with purpose hast become
Laborious persevering serious firm 
For this thy track across the fretful foam
Of vehement actions without scope or term
Called history keeps a splendor due to wit
Which saw one clew to life and followed it
In harmony with Nature Restless fool
Who with such heat dost preach what were to thee
When true the last impossibility 
To be like Nature strong like Nature cool
Know man hath all which Nature hath but more
And in that more lie all his hopes of good
Nature is cruel man is sick of blood
Nature is stubborn man would fain adore
Nature is fickle man hath need of rest
Nature forgives no debt and fears no grave
Man would be mild and with safe conscience blest
Man must begin know this where Nature ends
Nature and man can never be fast friends
Fool if thou canst not pass her rest her slave
Artist whose hand with horror winged hath torn
From the rank life of towns this leaf and flung
The prodigy of full-blown crime among
Valleys and men to middle fortune born
Not innocent indeed yet not forlorn 
Say what shall calm us when such guests intrude
Like comets on the heavenly solitude
Shall breathless glades cheered by shy Dian horn
Cold-bubbling springs or caves Not so The soul
Breasts her own griefs and urged too fiercely says
Why tremble True the nobleness of man
May be by man effaced man can control
To pain to death the bent of his own days
Know thou the worst So much not more he can
God knows it I am with you If to prize
Those virtues prized and practised by too few
But prized but loved but eminent in you
Man fundamental life if to despise
The barren optimistic sophistries
Of comfortable moles whom what they do
Teaches the limit of the just and true
And for such doing they require not eyes
If sadness at the long heart-wasting show
Wherein earth great ones are disquieted
If thoughts not idle while before me flow
The armies of the homeless and unfed 
If these are yours if this is what you are
Then am I yours and what you feel I share
Yet when I muse on what life is I seem
Rather to patience prompted than that proud
Prospect of hope which France proclaims so loud 
France famed in all great arts in none supreme
Seeing this vale this earth whereon we dream
Is on all sides o'ershadowed by the high
Uno'erleaped mountains of necessity
Sparing us narrower margin than we deem
Nor will that day dawn at a human nod
When bursting through the network superposed
By selfish occupation plot and plan
Lust avarice envy liberated man
All difference with his fellow-mortal closed
Shall be left standing face to face with God
Children as such forgive them have I known
Ever in their own eager pastime bent
To make the incurious bystander intent
On his own swarming thoughts an interest own 
Too fearful or too fond to play alone
Do thou whom light in thine own inmost soul
Not less thy boast illuminates control
Wishes unworthy of a man full-grown
What though the holy secret which moulds thee
Moulds not the solid earth though never winds
Have whispered it to the complaining sea
Nature great law and law of all men minds
To its own impulse every creature stirs
Live by thy light and earth will live by hers
Not by the justice that my father spurned
Not for the thousands whom my father slew
Altars unfed and temples overturned
Cold hearts and thankless tongues where thanks are due
Fell this dread voice from lips that cannot lie
Stern sentence of the Powers of Destiny
I will unfold my sentence and my crime
My crime that rapt in reverential awe
I sate obedient in the fiery prime
Of youth self-governed at the feet of Law
Ennobling this dull pomp the life of kings
By contemplation of diviner things
My father loved injustice and lived long
Crowned with gray hairs he died and full of sway
I loved the good he scorned and hated wrong 
The gods declare my recompense to-day
I looked for life more lasting rule more high
And when six years are measured lo I die
Yet surely O my people did I deem
Man justice from the all-just gods was given
A light that from some upper fount did beam
Some better archetype whose seat was heaven
A light that shining from the blest abodes
Did shadow somewhat of the life of gods
Mere phantoms of man self-tormenting heart
Which on the sweets that woo it dares not feed
Vain dreams which quench our pleasures then depart
When the duped soul self-mastered claims its meed
When on the strenuous just man Heaven bestows
Crown of his struggling life an unjust close
Seems it so light a thing then austere powers
To spurn man common lure life pleasant things
Seems there no joy in dances crowned with flowers
Love free to range and regal banquetings
Bend ye on these indeed an unmoved eye
Not gods but ghosts in frozen apathy
Or is it that some force too stern too strong
Even for yourselves to conquer or beguile
Bears earth and heaven and men and gods along
Like the broad volume of the insurgent Nile
And the great powers we serve themselves may be
Slaves of a tyrannous necessity
Or in mid-heaven perhaps your golden cars
Where earthly voice climbs never wing their flight
And in wild hunt through mazy tracts of stars
Sweep in the sounding stillness of the night
Or in deaf ease on thrones of dazzling sheen
Drinking deep draughts of joy ye dwell serene
Oh wherefore cheat our youth if thus it be
Of one short joy one lust one pleasant dream
Stringing vain words of powers we cannot see
Blind divinations of a will supreme
Lost labor when the circumambient gloom
But hides if gods gods careless of our doom
The rest I give to joy Even while I speak
My sand runs short and as yon star-shot ray
Hemmed by two banks of cloud peers pale and weak
Now as the barrier closes dies away 
Even so do past and future intertwine
Blotting this six years' space which yet is mine
Six years six little years six drops of time
Yet suns shall rise and many moons shall wane
And old men die and young men pass their prime
And languid pleasure fade and flower again
And the dull gods behold ere these are flown
Revels more deep joy keener than their own
Into the silence of the groves and woods
I will go forth though something would I say 
Something yet what I know not for the gods
The doom they pass revoke not nor delay
And prayers and gifts and tears are fruitless all
And the night waxes and the shadows fall
Ye men of Egypt ye have heard your king
I go and I return not But the will
Of the great gods is plain and ye must bring
Ill deeds ill passions zealous to fulfil
Their pleasure to their feet and reap their praise 
The praise of gods rich boon and length of days
 So spake he half in anger half in scorn
And one loud cry of grief and of amaze
Broke from his sorrowing people so he spake
And turning left them there and with brief pause
Girt with a throng of revellers bent his way
To the cool region of the groves he loved
There by the river-banks he wandered on
From palm-grove on to palm-grove happy trees
Their smooth tops shining sunward and beneath
Burying their unsunned stems in grass and flowers
Where in one dream the feverish time of youth
Might fade in slumber and the feet of joy
Might wander all day long and never tire
Here came the king holding high feast at morn
Rose-crowned and ever when the sun went down
A hundred lamps beamed in the tranquil gloom
From tree to tree all through the twinkling grove
Revealing all the tumult of the feast 
Flushed guests and golden goblets foamed with wine
While the deep-burnished foliage overhead
Splintered the silver arrows of the moon
It may be that sometimes his wondering soul
From the loud joyful laughter of his lips
Might shrink half startled like a guilty man
Who wrestles with his dream as some pale shape
Gliding half hidden through the dusky stems
Would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl
Whispering A little space and thou art mine
It may be on that joyless feast his eye
Dwelt with mere outward seeming he within
Took measure of his soul and knew its strength
And by that silent knowledge day by day
Was calmed ennobled comforted sustained
It may be but not less his brow was smooth
And his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom
And his mirth quailed not at the mild reproof
Sighed out by winter sad tranquillity
Nor palled with its own fulness ebbed and died
In the rich languor of long summer-days
Nor withered when the palm-tree plumes that roofed
With their mild dark his grassy banquet-hall
Bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring
No nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds
So six long years he revelled night and day
And when the mirth waxed loudest with dull sound
Sometimes from the grove centre echoes came
To tell his wondering people of their king
In the still night across the steaming flats
Mixed with the murmur of the moving Nile
So rest forever rest O princely pair
In your high church 'mid the still mountain-air
Where horn and hound and vassals never come
Only the blessed saints are smiling dumb
From the rich painted windows of the nave
On aisle and transept and your marble grave
Where thou young prince shalt never more arise
From the fringed mattress where thy duchess lies
On autumn-mornings when the bugle sounds
And ride across the drawbridge with thy hounds
To hunt the boar in the crisp woods till eve
And thou O princess shalt no more receive
Thou and thy ladies in the hall of state
The jaded hunters with their bloody freight
Coming benighted to the castle-gate
So sleep forever sleep O marble pair
Or if ye wake let it be then when fair
On the carved western front a flood of light
Streams from the setting sun and colors bright
Prophets transfigured saints and martyrs brave
In the vast western window of the nave
And on the pavement round the tomb there glints
A checker-work of glowing sapphire-tints
And amethyst and ruby then unclose
Your eyelids on the stone where ye repose
And from your broidered pillows lift your heads
And rise upon your cold white marble beds
And looking down on the warm rosy tints
Which checker at your feet the illumined flints
Say What is this we are in bliss forgiven 
Behold the pavement of the courts of heaven
Or let it be on autumn-nights when rain
Doth rustlingly above your heads complain
On the smooth leaden roof and on the walls
Shedding her pensive light at intervals
The moon through the clere-story windows shines
And the wind washes through the mountain-pines 
Then gazing up 'mid the dim pillars high
The foliaged marble forest where ye lie
Hush ye will say it is eternity
This is the glimmering verge of heaven and these
The columns of the heavenly palaces
And in the sweeping of the wind your ear
The passage of the angels' wings will hear
And on the lichen-crusted leads above
The rustle of the eternal rain of love
Who taught this pleading to unpractised eyes
Who hid such import in an infant gloom
Who lent thee child this meditative guise
Who massed round that slight brow these clouds of doom
Lo sails that gleam a moment and are gone
The swinging waters and the clustered pier
Not idly earth and ocean labor on
Nor idly do these sea-birds hover near
But thou whom superfluity of joy
Wafts not from thine own thoughts nor longings vain
Nor weariness the full-fed soul annoy
Remaining in thy hunger and in thy pain
Thou drugging pain by patience half averse
From thine own mother breast that knows not thee
With eyes which sought thine eyes thou didst converse
And that soul-searching vision fell on me
Glooms that go deep as thine I have not known
Moods of fantastic sadness nothing worth
Thy sorrow and thy calmness are thine own
Glooms that enhance and glorify this earth
What mood wears like complexion to thy woe
His who in mountain glens at noon of day
Sits rapt and hears the battle break below
 Ah thine was not the shelter but the fray
Some exile mindful how the past was glad
Some angel in an alien planet born
 No exile dream was ever half so sad
Nor any angel sorrow so forlorn
Is the calm thine of stoic souls who weigh
Life well and find it wanting nor deplore
But in disdainful silence turn away
Stand mute self-centred stern and dream no more
Or do I wait to hear some gray-haired king
Unravel all his many-colored lore
Whose mind hath known all arts of governing
Mused much loved life a little loathed it more
Down the pale cheek long lines of shadow slope
Which years and curious thought and suffering give
 Thou hast foreknown the vanity of hope
Foreseen thy harvest yet proceed'st to live
O meek anticipant of that sure pain
Whose sureness gray-haired scholars hardly learn
What wonder shall time breed to swell thy strain
What heavens what earth what suns shalt thou discern
Ere the long night whose stillness brooks no star
Match that funereal aspect with her pall
I think thou wilt have fathomed life too far
Have known too much or else forgotten all
The Guide of our dark steps a triple veil
Betwixt our senses and our sorrow keeps
Hath sown with cloudless passages the tale
Of grief and eased us with a thousand sleeps
Ah not the nectarous poppy lovers use
Not daily labor dull Lethaean spring
Oblivion in lost angels can infuse
Of the soiled glory and the trailing wing
And though thou glean what strenuous gleaners may
In the thronged fields where winning comes by strife
And though the just sun gild as mortals pray
Some reaches of thy storm-vexed stream of life
Though that blank sunshine blind thee though the cloud
That severed the world march and thine be gone
Though ease dulls grace and wisdom be too proud
To halve a lodging that was all her own 
Once ere thy day go down thou shalt discern
Oh once ere night in thy success thy chain
Ere the long evening close thou shalt return
And wear this majesty of grief again
And the first gray of morning filled the east
And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream
But all the Tartar camp along the stream
Was hushed and still the men were plunged in sleep
Sohrab alone he slept not all night long
He had lain wakeful tossing on his bed
But when the gray dawn stole into his tent
He rose and clad himself and girt his sword
And took his horseman cloak and left his tent
And went abroad into the cold wet fog
Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa tent
Through the black Tartar tents he passed which stood
Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand
Of Oxus where the summer-floods o'erflow
When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere
Through the black tents he passed o'er that low strand
And to a hillock came a little back
From the stream brink the spot where first a boat
Crossing the stream in summer scrapes the land
The men of former times had crowned the top
With a clay fort but that was fallen and now
The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa tent
A dome of laths and o'er it felts were spread
And Sohrab came there and went in and stood
Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent
And found the old man sleeping on his bed
Of rugs and felts and near him lay his arms
And Peran-Wisa heard him though the step
Was dulled for he slept light an old man sleep
And he rose quickly on one arm and said 
Who art thou for it is not yet clear dawn
Speak is there news or any night alarm
But Sohrab came to the bedside and said 
Thou know'st me Peran-Wisa it is I
The sun has not yet risen and the foe
Sleep but I sleep not all night long I lie
Tossing and wakeful and I come to thee
For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek
Thy counsel and to heed thee as thy son
In Samarcand before the army marched
And I will tell thee what my heart desires
Thou know'st if since from Ader-baijan first
I came among the Tartars and bore arms
I have still served Afrasiab well and shown
At my boy years the courage of a man
This too thou know'st that while I still bear on
The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world
And beat the Persians back on every field
I seek one man one man and one alone 
Rustum my father who I hoped should greet
Should one day greet upon some well-fought field
His not unworthy not inglorious son
So I long hoped but him I never find
Come then hear now and grant me what I ask
Let the two armies rest to-day but I
Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords
To meet me man to man if I prevail
Rustum will surely hear it if I fall 
Old man the dead need no one claim no kin
Dim is the rumor of a common fight
Where host meets host and many names are sunk
But of a single combat fame speaks clear
He spoke and Peran-Wisa took the hand
Of the young man in his and sighed and said 
O Sohrab an unquiet heart is thine
Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs
And share the battle common chance with us
Who love thee but must press forever first
In single fight incurring single risk
To find a father thou hast never seen
That were far best my son to stay with us
Unmurmuring in our tents while it is war
And when 'tis truce then in Afrasiab towns
But if this one desire indeed rules all
To seek out Rustum seek him not through fight
Seek him in peace and carry to his arms
O Sohrab carry an unwounded son
But far hence seek him for he is not here
For now it is not as when I was young
When Rustum was in front of every fray
But now he keeps apart and sits at home
In Seistan with Zal his father old
Whether that his own mighty strength at last
Feels the abhorred approaches of old age
Or in some quarrel with the Persian king
There go Thou wilt not Yet my heart forebodes
Danger or death awaits thee on this field
Fain would I know thee safe and well though lost
To us fain therefore send thee hence in peace
To seek thy father not seek single fights
In vain But who can keep the lion cub
From ravening and who govern Rustum son
Go I will grant thee what thy heart desires
So said he and dropped Sohrab hand and left
His bed and the warm rugs whereon he lay
And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat
He passed and tied his sandals on his feet
And threw a white cloak round him and he took
In his right hand a ruler staff no sword
And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap
Black glossy curled the fleece of Kara-Kul
And raised the curtain of his tent and called
His herald to his side and went abroad
The sun by this had risen and cleared the fog
From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands
And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed
Into the open plain so Haman bade 
Haman who next to Peran-Wisa ruled
The host and still was in his lusty prime
From their black tents long files of horse they streamed
As when some gray November morn the files
In marching order spread of long-necked cranes
Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes
Of Elburz from the Aralian estuaries
Or some frore Caspian reed-bed southward bound
For the warm Persian seaboard so they streamed
The Tartars of the Oxus the king guard
First with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears
Large men large steeds who from Bokhara come
And Khiva and ferment the milk of mares
Next the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south
The Tukas and the lances of Salore
And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands
Light men and on light steeds who only drink
The acrid milk of camels and their wells
And then a swarm of wandering horse who came
From far and a more doubtful service owned 
The Tartars of Ferghana from the banks
Of the Jaxartes men with scanty beards
And close-set skull-caps and those wilder hordes
Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste
Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks tribes who stray
Nearest the Pole and wandering Kirghizzes
Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere 
These all filed out from camp into the plain
And on the other side the Persians formed 
First a light cloud of horse Tartars they seemed
The Ilyats of Khorassan and behind
The royal troops of Persia horse and foot
Marshalled battalions bright in burnished steel
But Peran-Wisa with his herald came
Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front
And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks
And when Ferood who led the Persians saw
That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back
He took his spear and to the front he came
And checked his ranks and fixed them where they stood
And the old Tartar came upon the sand
Betwixt the silent hosts and spake and said 
Ferood and ye Persians and Tartars hear
Let there be truce between the hosts to-day
But choose a champion from the Persian lords
To fight our champion Sohrab man to man
As in the country on a morn in June
When the dew glistens on the pearled ears
A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy 
So when they heard what Peran-Wisa said
A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran
Of pride and hope for Sohrab whom they loved
But as a troop of pedlers from Cabool
Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus
That vast sky-neighboring mountain of milk snow
Crossing so high that as they mount they pass
Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow
Choked by the air and scarce can they themselves
Slake their parched throats with sugared mulberries
In single file they move and stop their breath
For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows 
So the pale Persians held their breath with fear
And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up
To counsel Gudurz and Zoarrah came
And Feraburz who ruled the Persian host
Second and was the uncle of the king
These came and counselled and then Gudurz said 
Ferood shame bids us take their challenge up
Yet champion have we none to match this youth
He has the wild stag foot the lion heart
But Rustum came last night aloof he sits
And sullen and has pitched his tents apart
Him will I seek and carry to his ear
The Tartar challenge and this young man name
Haply he will forget his wrath and fight
Stand forth the while and take their challenge up
So spake he and Ferood stood forth and cried 
Old man be it agreed as thou hast said
Let Sohrab arm and we will find a man
He spake and Peran-Wisa turned and strode
Back through the opening squadrons to his tent
But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran
And crossed the camp which lay behind and reached
Out on the sands beyond it Rustum tents
Of scarlet cloth they were and glittering gay
Just pitched the high pavilion in the midst
Was Rustum and his men lay camped around
And Gudurz entered Rustum tent and found
Rustum his morning meal was done but still
The table stood before him charged with food 
A side of roasted sheep and cakes of bread
And dark-green melons and there Rustum sate
Listless and held a falcon on his wrist
And played with it but Gudurz came and stood
Before him and he looked and saw him stand
And with a cry sprang up and dropped the bird
And greeted Gudurz with both hands and said 
Welcome these eyes could see no better sight
What news but sit down first and eat and drink
But Gudurz stood in the tent-door and said 
Not now A time will come to eat and drink
But not to-day to-day has other needs
The armies are drawn out and stand at gaze
For from the Tartars is a challenge brought
To pick a champion from the Persian lords
To fight their champion and thou know'st his name
Sohrab men call him but his birth is hid
O Rustum like thy might is this young man's
He has the wild stag foot the lion heart
And he is young and Iran chiefs are old
Or else too weak and all eyes turn to thee
Come down and help us Rustum or we lose
He spoke but Rustum answered with a smile 
Go to if Iran chiefs are old then I
Am older If the young are weak the king
Errs strangely for the king for Kai Khosroo
Himself is young and honors younger men
And lets the aged moulder to their graves
Rustum he loves no more but loves the young
The young may rise at Sohrab vaunts not I
For what care I though all speak Sohrab fame
For would that I myself had such a son
And not that one slight helpless girl I have 
A son so famed so brave to send to war
And I to tarry with the snow-haired Zal
My father whom the robber Afghans vex
And clip his borders short and drive his herds
And he has none to guard his weak old age
There would I go and hang my armor up
And with my great name fence that weak old man
And spend the goodly treasures I have got
And rest my age and hear of Sohrab fame
And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings
And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more
He spoke and smiled and Gudurz made reply 
What then O Rustum will men say to this
When Sohrab dares our bravest forth and seeks
Thee most of all and thou whom most he seeks
Hidest thy face Take heed lest men should say 
Like some old miser Rustum hoards his fame
And shuns to peril it with younger men
And greatly moved then Rustum made reply 
O Gudurz wherefore dost thou say such words
Thou knowest better words than this to say
What is one more one less obscure or famed
Valiant or craven young or old to me
Are not they mortal am not I myself
But who for men of naught would do great deeds
Come thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame
But I will fight unknown and in plain arms
Let not men say of Rustum he was matched
In single fight with any mortal man
He spoke and frowned and Gudurz turned and ran
Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy 
Fear at his wrath but joy that Rustum came
But Rustum strode to his tent-door and called
His followers in and bade them bring his arms
And clad himself in steel The arms he chose
Were plain and on his shield was no device
Only his helm was rich inlaid with gold
And from the fluted spine a-top a plume
Of horse-hair waved a scarlet horse-hair plume
So armed he issued forth and Ruksh his horse
Followed him like a faithful hound at heel 
Ruksh whose renown was noised through all the earth
The horse whom Rustum on a foray once
Did in Bokhara by the river find
A colt beneath its dam and drove him home
And reared him a bright bay with lofty crest
Dight with a saddle-cloth of broidered green
Crusted with gold and on the ground were worked
All beasts of chase all beasts which hunters know
So followed Rustum left his tents and crossed
The camp and to the Persian host appeared
And all the Persians knew him and with shouts
Hailed but the Tartars knew not who he was
And dear as the wet diver to the eyes
Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore
By sandy Bahrein in the Persian Gulf
Plunging all day in the blue waves at night
Having made up his tale of precious pearls
Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands 
So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came
And Rustum to the Persian front advanced
And Sohrab armed in Haman tent and came
And as a-field the reapers cut a swath
Down through the middle of a rich man corn
And on each side are squares of standing corn
And in the midst a stubble short and bare 
So on each side were squares of men with spears
Bristling and in the midst the open sand
And Rustum came upon the sand and cast
His eyes toward the Tartar tents and saw
Sohrab come forth and eyed him as he came
As some rich woman on a winter morn
Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge
Who with numb blackened fingers makes her fire 
At cock-crow on a starlit winter morn
When the frost flowers the whitened window-panes 
And wonders how she lives and what the thoughts
Of that poor drudge may be so Rustum eyed
The unknown adventurous youth who from afar
Came seeking Rustum and defying forth
All the most valiant chiefs long he perused
His spirited air and wondered who he was
For very young he seemed tenderly reared
Like some young cypress tall and dark and straight
Which in a queen secluded garden throws
Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf
By midnight to a bubbling fountain sound 
So slender Sohrab seemed so softly reared
And a deep pity entered Rustum soul
As he beheld him coming and he stood
And beckoned to him with his hand and said 
O thou young man the air of heaven is soft
And warm and pleasant but the grave is cold
Heaven air is better than the cold dead grave
Behold me I am vast and clad in iron
And tried and I have stood on many a field
Of blood and I have fought with many a foe
Never was that field lost or that foe saved
O Sohrab wherefore wilt thou rush on death
Be governed quit the Tartar host and come
To Iran and be as my son to me
And fight beneath my banner till I die
There are no youths in Iran brave as thou
So he spake mildly Sohrab heard his voice
The mighty voice of Rustum and he saw
His giant figure planted on the sand
Sole like some single tower which a chief
Hath builded on the waste in former years
Against the robbers and he saw that head
Streaked with its first gray hairs hope filled his soul
And he ran forward and embraced his knees
And clasped his hand within his own and said 
Oh by thy father head by thine own soul
Art thou not Rustum Speak art thou not he
But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth
And turned away and spake to his own soul 
Ah me I muse what this young fox may mean
False wily boastful are these Tartar boys
For if I now confess this thing he asks
And hide it not but say Rustum is here
He will not yield indeed nor quit our foes
But he will find some pretext not to fight
And praise my fame and proffer courteous gifts
A belt or sword perhaps and go his way
And on a feast-tide in Afrasiab hall
In Samarcand he will arise and cry 
'I challenged once when the two armies camped
Beside the Oxus all the Persian lords
To cope with me in single fight but they
Shrank only Rustum dared then he and I
Changed gifts and went on equal terms away
So will he speak perhaps while men applaud
Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me
And then he turned and sternly spake aloud 
Rise wherefore dost thou vainly question thus
Of Rustum I am here whom thou hast called
By challenge forth make good thy vaunt or yield
Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight
Rash boy men look on Rustum face and flee
For well I know that did great Rustum stand
Before thy face this day and were revealed
There would be then no talk of fighting more
But being what I am I tell thee this 
Do thou record it in thine inmost soul
Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield
Or else thy bones shall strew this sand till winds
Bleach them or Oxus with his summer-floods
Oxus in summer wash them all away
He spoke and Sohrab answered on his feet 
Art thou so fierce Thou wilt not fight me so
I am no girl to be made pale by words
Yet this thou hast said well did Rustum stand
Here on this field there were no fighting then
But Rustum is far hence and we stand here
Begin thou art more vast more dread than I
And thou art proved I know and I am young 
But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven
And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure
Thy victory yet thou canst not surely know
For we are all like swimmers in the sea
Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate
Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall
And whether it will heave us up to land
Or whether it will roll us out to sea 
Back out to sea to the deep waves of death 
We know not and no search will make us know
Only the event will teach us in its hour
He spoke and Rustum answered not but hurled
His spear down from the shoulder down it came
As on some partridge in the corn a hawk
That long has towered in the airy clouds
Drops like a plummet Sohrab saw it come
And sprang aside quick as a flash the spear
Hissed and went quivering down into the sand
Which it sent flying wide Then Sohrab threw
In turn and full struck Rustum shield sharp rang
The iron plates rang sharp but turned the spear
And Rustum seized his club which none but he
Could wield an unlopped trunk it was and huge
Still rough like those which men in treeless plains
To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers
Hyphasis or Hydaspes when high up
By their dark springs the wind in winter-time
Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack
And strewn the channels with torn boughs so huge
The club which Rustum lifted now and struck
One stroke but again Sohrab sprang aside
Lithe as the glancing snake and the club came
Thundering to earth and leapt from Rustum hand
And Rustum followed his own blow and fell
To his knees and with his fingers clutched the sand
And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword
And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay
Dizzy and on his knees and choked with sand
But he looked on and smiled nor bared his sword
But courteously drew back and spoke and said 
Thou strik'st too hard that club of thine will float
Upon the summer-floods and not my bones
But rise and be not wroth not wroth am I
No when I see thee wrath forsakes my soul
Thou say'st thou art not Rustum be it so
Who art thou then that canst so touch my soul
Boy as I am I have seen battles too 
Have waded foremost in their bloody waves
And heard their hollow roar of dying men
But never was my heart thus touched before
Are they from Heaven these softenings of the heart
O thou old warrior let us yield to Heaven
Come plant we here in earth our angry spears
And make a truce and sit upon this sand
And pledge each other in red wine like friends
And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum deeds
There are enough foes in the Persian host
Whom I may meet and strike and feel no pang
Champions enough Afrasiab has whom thou
Mayst fight fight them when they confront thy spear
But oh let there be peace 'twixt thee and me
He ceased but while he spake Rustum had risen
And stood erect trembling with rage his club
He left to lie but had regained his spear
Whose fiery point now in his mailed right hand
Blazed bright and baleful like that autumn-star
The baleful sign of fevers dust had soiled
His stately crest and dimmed his glittering arms
His breast heaved his lips foamed and twice his voice
Was choked with rage at last these words broke way 
Girl nimble with thy feet not with thy hands
Curled minion dancer coiner of sweet words
Fight let me hear thy hateful voice no more
Thou art not in Afrasiab gardens now
With Tartar girls with whom thou art wont to dance
But on the Oxus-sands and in the dance
Of battle and with me who make no play
Of war I fight it out and hand to hand
Speak not to me of truce and pledge and wine
Remember all thy valor try thy feints
And cunning all the pity I had is gone
Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts
With thy light skipping tricks and thy girl wiles
He spoke and Sohrab kindled at his taunts
And he too drew his sword at once they rushed
Together as two eagles on one prey
Come rushing down together from the clouds
One from the east one from the west their shields
Dashed with a clang together and a din
Rose such as that the sinewy woodcutters
Make often in the forest heart at morn
Of hewing axes crashing trees such blows
Rustum and Sohrab on each other hailed
And you would say that sun and stars took part
In that unnatural conflict for a cloud
Grew suddenly in heaven and darked the sun
Over the fighters' heads and a wind rose
Under their feet and moaning swept the plain
And in a sandy whirlwind wrapped the pair
In gloom they twain were wrapped and they alone
For both the on-looking hosts on either hand
Stood in broad daylight and the sky was pure
And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream
But in the gloom they fought with bloodshot eyes
And laboring breath First Rustum struck the shield
Which Sohrab held stiff out the steel-spiked spear
Rent the tough plates but failed to reach the skin
And Rustum plucked it back with angry groan
Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum helm
Nor clove its steel quite through but all the crest
He shore away and that proud horse-hair plume
Never till now defiled sank to the dust
And Rustum bowed his head But then the gloom
Grew blacker thunder rumbled in the air
And lightnings rent the cloud and Ruksh the horse
Who stood at hand uttered a dreadful cry
No horse cry was that most like the roar
Of some pained desert-lion who all day
Has trailed the hunter javelin in his side
And comes at night to die upon the sand
The two hosts heard that cry and quaked for fear
And Oxus curdled as it crossed his stream
But Sohrab heard and quailed not but rushed on
And struck again and again Rustum bowed
His head but this time all the blade like glass
Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm
And in the hand the hilt remained alone
Then Rustum raised his head his dreadful eyes
Glared and he shook on high his menacing spear
And shouted Rustum Sohrab heard that shout
And shrank amazed back he recoiled one step
And scanned with blinking eyes the advancing form
And then he stood bewildered and he dropped
His covering shield and the spear pierced his side
He reeled and staggering back sank to the ground
And then the gloom dispersed and the wind fell
And the bright sun broke forth and melted all
The cloud and the two armies saw the pair 
Saw Rustum standing safe upon his feet
And Sohrab wounded on the bloody sand
Then with a bitter smile Rustum began 
Sohrab thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill
A Persian lord this day and strip his corpse
And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab tent
Or else that the great Rustum would come down
Himself to fight and that thy wiles would move
His heart to take a gift and let thee go
And then that all the Tartar host would praise
Thy courage or thy craft and spread thy fame
To glad thy father in his weak old age
Fool thou art slain and by an unknown man
Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be
Than to thy friends and to thy father old
And with a fearless mien Sohrab replied 
Unknown thou art yet thy fierce vaunt is vain
Thou dost not slay me proud and boastful man
No Rustum slays me and this filial heart
For were I matched with ten such men as thee
And I were that which till to-day I was
They should be lying here I standing there
But that beloved name unnerved my arm 
That name and something I confess in thee
Which troubles all my heart and made my shield
Fall and thy spear transfixed an unarmed foe
And now thou boastest and insult'st my fate
But hear thou this fierce man tremble to hear
The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death
My father whom I seek through all the world
He shall avenge my death and punish thee
As when some hunter in the spring hath found
A breeding eagle sitting on her nest
Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake
And pierced her with an arrow as she rose
And followed her to find her where she fell
Far off anon her mate comes winging back
From hunting and a great way off descries
His huddling young left sole at that he checks
His pinion and with short uneasy sweeps
Circles above his eyry with loud screams
Chiding his mate back to her nest but she
Lies dying with the arrow in her side
In some far stony gorge out of his ken
A heap of fluttering feathers never more
Shall the lake glass her flying over it
Never the black and dripping precipices
Echo her stormy scream as she sails by 
As that poor bird flies home nor knows his loss
So Rustum knew not his own loss but stood
Over his dying son and knew him not
And with a cold incredulous voice he said 
What prate is this of fathers and revenge
The mighty Rustum never had a son
And with a failing voice Sohrab replied 
Ah yes he had and that lost son am I
Surely the news will one day reach his ear 
Reach Rustum where he sits and tarries long
Somewhere I know not where but far from here
And pierce him like a stab and make him leap
To arms and cry for vengeance upon thee
Fierce man bethink thee for an only son
What will that grief what will that vengeance be
Oh could I live till I that grief had seen
Yet him I pity not so much but her
My mother who in Ader-baijan dwells
With that old king her father who grows gray
With age and rules over the valiant Koords
Her most I pity who no more will see
Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp
With spoils and honor when the war is done
But a dark rumor will be bruited up
From tribe to tribe until it reach her ear
And then will that defenceless woman learn
That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more
But that in battle with a nameless foe
By the far-distant Oxus he is slain
He spoke and as he ceased he wept aloud
Thinking of her he left and his own death
He spoke but Rustum listened plunged in thought
Nor did he yet believe it was his son
Who spoke although he called back names he knew
For he had had sure tidings that the babe
Which was in Ader-baijan born to him
Had been a puny girl no boy at all 
So that sad mother sent him word for fear
Rustum should seek the boy to train in arms
And so he deemed that either Sohrab took
By a false boast the style of Rustum son
Or that men gave it him to swell his fame
So deemed he yet he listened plunged in thought
And his soul set to grief as the vast tide
Of the bright rocking ocean sets to shore
At the full moon tears gathered in his eyes
For he remembered his own early youth
And all its bounding rapture as at dawn
The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries
A far bright city smitten by the sun
Through many rolling clouds so Rustum saw
His youth saw Sohrab mother in her bloom
And that old king her father who loved well
His wandering guest and gave him his fair child
With joy and all the pleasant life they led
They three in that long-distant summer-time 
The castle and the dewy woods and hunt
And hound and morn on those delightful hills
In Ader-baijan And he saw that youth
Of age and looks to be his own dear son
Piteous and lovely lying on the sand
Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe
Of an unskilful gardener has been cut
Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed
And lies a fragrant tower of purple bloom
On the mown dying grass so Sohrab lay
Lovely in death upon the common sand
And Rustum gazed on him with grief and said 
O Sohrab thou indeed art such a son
Whom Rustum wert thou his might well have loved
Yet here thou errest Sohrab or else men
Have told thee false thou art not Rustum son
For Rustum had no son one child he had 
But one a girl who with her mother now
Plies some light female task nor dreams of us 
Of us she dreams not nor of wounds nor war
But Sohrab answered him in wrath for now
The anguish of the deep-fixed spear grew fierce
And he desired to draw forth the steel
And let the blood flow free and so to die
But first he would convince his stubborn foe
And rising sternly on one arm he said 
Man who art thou who dost deny my words
Truth sits upon the lips of dying men
And falsehood while I lived was far from mine
I tell thee pricked upon this arm I bear
That seal which Rustum to my mother gave
That she might prick it on the babe she bore
He spoke and all the blood left Rustum cheeks
And his knees tottered and he smote his hand
Against his breast his heavy mailed hand
That the hard iron corslet clanked aloud
And to his heart he pressed the other hand
And in a hollow voice he spake and said 
Sohrab that were a proof which could not lie
If thou show this then art thou Rustum son
Then with weak hasty fingers Sohrab loosed
His belt and near the shoulder bared his arm
And showed a sign in faint vermilion points
Pricked as a cunning workman in Pekin
Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase
An emperor gift at early morn he paints
And all day long and when night comes the lamp
Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands 
So delicately pricked the sign appeared
On Sohrab arm the sign of Rustum seal
It was that griffin which of old reared Zal
Rustum great father whom they left to die
A helpless babe among the mountain rocks
Him that kind creature found and reared and loved
Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign
And Sohrab bared that image on his arm
And himself scanned it long with mournful eyes
And then he touched it with his hand and said 
How say'st thou Is that sign the proper sign
Of Rustum son or of some other man's
He spoke but Rustum gazed and gazed and stood
Speechless and then he uttered one sharp cry 
O boy thy father and his voice choked there
And then a dark cloud passed before his eyes
And his head swam and he sank down to earth
But Sohrab crawled to where he lay and cast
His arms about his neck and kissed his lips
And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks
Trying to call him back to life and life
Came back to Rustum and he oped his eyes
And they stood wide with horror and he seized
In both his hands the dust which lay around
And threw it on his head and smirched his hair 
His hair and face and beard and glittering arms
And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast
And his sobs choked him and he clutched his sword
To draw it and forever let life out
But Sohrab saw his thought and held his hands
And with a soothing voice he spake and said 
Father forbear for I but meet to-day
The doom which at my birth was written down
In Heaven and thou art Heaven unconscious hand
Surely my heart cried out that it was thou
When first I saw thee and thy heart spoke too
I know it But fate trod those promptings down
Under its iron heel fate fate engaged
The strife and hurled me on my father spear
But let us speak no more of this I find
My father let me feel that I have found
Come sit beside me on this sand and take
My head betwixt thy hands and kiss my cheeks
And wash them with thy tears and say My son
Quick quick for numbered are my sands of life
And swift for like the lightning to this field
I came and like the wind I go away 
Sudden and swift and like a passing wind
But it was writ in Heaven that this should be
So said he and his voice released the heart
Of Rustum and his tears broke forth he cast
His arms round his son neck and wept aloud
And kissed him And awe fell on both the hosts
When they saw Rustum grief and Ruksh the horse
With his head bowing to the ground and mane
Sweeping the dust came near and in mute woe
First to the one then to the other moved
His head as if inquiring what their grief
Might mean and from his dark compassionate eyes
The big warm tears rolled down and caked the sand
But Rustum chid him with stern voice and said 
Ruksh now thou grievest but O Ruksh thy feet
Should then have rotted on their nimble joints
When first they bore thy master to this field
But Sohrab looked upon the horse and said 
Is this then Ruksh How often in past days
My mother told me of thee thou brave steed
My terrible father terrible horse and said
That I should one day find thy lord and thee
Come let me lay my hand upon thy mane
O Ruksh thou art more fortunate than I
For thou hast gone where I shall never go
And snuffed the breezes of my father home
And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan
And seen the River of Helmund and the Lake
Of Zirrah and the aged Zal himself
Has often stroked thy neck and given thee food
Corn in a golden platter soaked with wine
And said O Ruksh bear Rustum well But I
Have never known my grandsire furrowed face
Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan
Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream
But lodged among my father foes and seen
Afrasiab cities only Samarcand
Bokhara and lone Khiva in the waste
And the black Toorkmun tents and only drunk
The desert rivers Moorghab and Tejend
Kohik and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep
The northern Sir and this great Oxus stream
The yellow Oxus by whose brink I die
Then with a heavy groan Rustum bewailed 
Oh that its waves were flowing over me
Oh that I saw its grains of yellow silt
Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head
But with a grave mild voice Sohrab replied 
Desire not that my father thou must live
For some are born to do great deeds and live
As some are born to be obscured and die
Do thou the deeds I die too young to do
And reap a second glory in thine age
Thou art my father and thy gain is mine
But come thou seest this great host of men
Which follow me I pray thee slay not these
Let me entreat for them what have they done
They followed me my hope my fame my star
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace
But me thou must bear hence not send with them
But carry me with thee to Seistan
And place me on a bed and mourn for me 
Thou and the snow-haired Zal and all thy friends
And thou must lay me in that lovely earth
And heap a stately mound above my bones
And plant a far-seen pillar over all
That so the passing horseman on the waste
May see my tomb a great way off and cry 
Sohrab the mighty Rustum son lies there
Whom his great father did in ignorance kill
And I be not forgotten in my grave
And with a mournful voice Rustum replied 
Fear not as thou hast said Sohrab my son
So shall it be for I will burn my tents
And quit the host and bear thee hence with me
And carry thee away to Seistan
And place thee on a bed and mourn for thee
With the snow-headed Zal and all my friends
And I will lay thee in that lovely earth
And heap a stately mound above thy bones
And plant a far-seen pillar over all
And men shall not forget thee in thy grave
And I will spare thy host yea let them go
Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace
What should I do with slaying any more
For would that all whom I have ever slain
Might be once more alive my bitterest foes
And they who were called champions in their time
And through whose death I won that fame I have 
And I were nothing but a common man
A poor mean soldier and without renown
So thou mightest live too my son my son
Or rather would that I even I myself
Might now be lying on this bloody sand
Near death and by an ignorant stroke of thine
Not thou of mine and I might die not thou
And I not thou be borne to Seistan
And Zal might weep above my grave not thine
And say O son I weep thee not too sore
For willingly I know thou met'st thine end
But now in blood and battles was my youth
And full of blood and battles is my age
And I shall never end this life of blood
Then at the point of death Sohrab replied 
A life of blood indeed thou dreadful man
But thou shalt yet have peace only not now
Not yet but thou shalt have it on that day
When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship
Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo
Returning home over the salt blue sea
From laying thy dear master in his grave
And Rustum gazed in Sohrab face and said 
Soon be that day my son and deep that sea
Till then if fate so wills let me endure
He spoke and Sohrab smiled on him and took
The spear and drew it from his side and eased
His wound imperious anguish but the blood
Came welling from the open gash and life
Flowed with the stream all down his cold white side
The crimson torrent ran dim now and soiled
Like the soiled tissue of white violets
Left freshly gathered on their native bank
By children whom their nurses call with haste
In-doors from the sun eye his head drooped low
His limbs grew slack motionless white he lay 
White with eyes closed only when heavy gasps
Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame
Convulsed him back to life he opened them
And fixed them feebly on his father face
Till now all strength was ebbed and from his limbs
Unwillingly the spirit fled away
Regretting the warm mansion which it left
And youth and bloom and this delightful world
So on the bloody sand Sohrab lay dead
And the great Rustum drew his horseman cloak
Down o'er his face and sate by his dead son
As those black granite pillars once high-reared
By Jemshid in Persepolis to bear
His house now 'mid their broken flights of steps
Lie prone enormous down the mountain side 
So in the sand lay Rustum by his son
And night came down over the solemn waste
And the two gazing hosts and that sole pair
And darkened all and a cold fog with night
Crept from the Oxus Soon a hum arose
As of a great assembly loosed and fires
Began to twinkle through the fog for now
Both armies moved to camp and took their meal
The Persians took it on the open sands
Southward the Tartars by the river-marge
And Rustum and his son were left alone
But the majestic river floated on
Out of the mist and hum of that low land
Into the frosty starlight and there moved
Rejoicing through the hushed Chorasmian waste
Under the solitary moon he flowed
Right for the polar star past Orgunje
Brimming and bright and large then sands begin
To hem his watery march and dam his streams
And split his currents that for many a league
The shorn and parcelled Oxus strains along
Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles 
Oxus forgetting the bright speed he had
In his high mountain cradle in Pamere
A foiled circuitous wanderer till at last
The longed-for dash of waves is heard and wide
His luminous home of waters opens bright
And tranquil from whose floor the new-bathed stars
Emerge and shine upon the Aral Sea
So on the floor lay Balder dead and round
Lay thickly strewn swords axes darts and spears
Which all the gods in sport had idly thrown
At Balder whom no weapon pierced or clove
But in his breast stood fixed the fatal bough
Of mistletoe which Lok the Accuser gave
To Hoder and unwitting Hoder threw threw 
'Gainst that alone had Balder life no charm
And all the gods and all the heroes came
And stood round Balder on the bloody floor
Weeping and wailing and Valhalla rang
Up to its golden roof with sobs and cries
And on the tables stood the untasted meats
And in the horns and gold-rimmed sculls the wine
And now would night have fallen and found them yet
Wailing but otherwise was Odin will
And thus the Father of the ages spake 
Enough of tears ye gods enough of wail
Not to lament in was Valhalla made
If any here might weep for Balder death
I most might weep his father such a son
I lose to-day so bright so loved a god
But he has met that doom which long ago
The Nornies when his mother bare him spun
And fate set seal that so his end must be
Balder has met his death and ye survive
Weep him an hour but what can grief avail
For ye yourselves ye gods shall meet your doom 
All ye who hear me and inhabit heaven
And I too Odin too the lord of all
But ours we shall not meet when that day comes
With women tears and weak complaining cries
Why should we meet another portion so
Rather it fits you having wept your hour
With cold dry eyes and hearts composed and stern
To live as erst your daily life in heaven
By me shall vengeance on the murderer Lok
The foe the accuser whom though gods we hate
Be strictly cared for in the appointed day
Meanwhile to-morrow when the morning dawns
Bring wood to the seashore to Balder ship
And on the deck build high a funeral pile
And on the top lay Balder corpse and put
Fire to the wood and send him out to sea
To burn for that is what the dead desire
So spake the king of gods and straightway rose
And mounted his horse Sleipner whom he rode
And from the hall of heaven he rode away
To Lidskialf and sate upon his throne
The mount from whence his eye surveys the world
And far from heaven he turned his shining orbs
To look on Midgard and the earth and men
And on the conjuring Lapps he bent his gaze
Whom antlered reindeer pull over the snow
And on the Finns the gentlest of mankind
Fair men who live in holes under the ground
Nor did he look once more to Ida plain
Nor toward Valhalla and the sorrowing gods
For well he knew the gods would heed his word
And cease to mourn and think of Balder pyre
But in Valhalla all the gods went back
From around Balder all the heroes went
And left his body stretched upon the floor
And on their golden chairs they sate again
Beside the tables in the hall of heaven
And before each the cooks who served them placed
New messes of the boar Serimner flesh
And the Valkyries crowned their horns with mead
So they with pent-up hearts and tearless eyes
Wailing no more in silence ate and drank
While twilight fell and sacred night came on
But the blind Hoder left the feasting gods
In Odin hall and went through Asgard streets
And past the haven where the gods have moored
Their ships and through the gate beyond the wall
Though sightless yet his own mind led the god
Down to the margin of the roaring sea
He came and sadly went along the sand
Between the waves and black o'erhanging cliffs
Where in and out the screaming seafowl fly
Until he came to where a gully breaks
Through the cliff-wall and a fresh stream runs down
From the high moors behind and meets the sea
There in the glen Fensaler stands the house
Of Frea honored mother of the gods
And shows its lighted windows to the main
There he went up and passed the open doors
And in the hall he found those women old
The prophetesses who by rite eterne
On Frea hearth feed high the sacred fire
Both night and day and by the inner wall
Upon her golden chair the mother sate
With folded hands revolving things to come
To her drew Hoder near and spake and said 
Mother a child of bale thou bar'st in me
For first thou barest me with blinded eyes
Sightless and helpless wandering weak in heaven
And after that of ignorant witless mind
Thou barest me and unforeseeing soul
That I alone must take the branch from Lok
The foe the accuser whom though gods we hate
And cast it at the dear-loved Balder breast
At whom the gods in sport their weapons threw
'Gainst that alone had Balder life no charm
Now therefore what to attempt or whither fly
For who will bear my hateful sight in heaven
Can I O mother bring them Balder back
Or for thou know'st the fates and things allowed 
Can I with Hela power a compact strike
And make exchange and give my life for his
He spoke the mother of the gods replied 
Hoder ill-fated child of bale my son
Sightless in soul and eye what words are these
That one long portioned with his doom of death
Should change his lot and fill another life
And Hela yield to this and let him go
On Balder Death hath laid her hand not thee
Nor doth she count this life a price for that
For many gods in heaven not thou alone
Would freely die to purchase Balder back
And wend themselves to Hela gloomy realm
For not so gladsome is that life in heaven
Which gods and heroes lead in feast and fray
Waiting the darkness of the final times
That one should grudge its loss for Balder sake 
Balder their joy so bright so loved a god
But fate withstands and laws forbid this way
Yet in my secret mind one way I know
Nor do I judge if it shall win or fail
But much must still be tried which shall but fail
And the blind Hoder answered her and said 
What way is this O mother that thou show'st
Is it a matter which a god might try
And straight the mother of the gods replied 
There is a way which leads to Hela realm
Untrodden lonely far from light and heaven
Who goes that way must take no other horse
To ride but Sleipner Odin horse alone
Nor must he choose that common path of gods
Which every day they come and go in heaven
O'er the bridge Bifrost where is Heimdall watch
Past Midgard fortress down to earth and men
But he must tread a dark untravelled road
Which branches from the north of heaven and ride
Nine days nine nights toward the northern ice
Through valleys deep-ingulfed with roaring streams
And he will reach on the tenth morn a bridge
Which spans with golden arches Giall stream
Not Bifrost but that bridge a damsel keeps
Who tells the passing troops of dead their way
To the low shore of ghosts and Hela realm
And she will bid him northward steer his course
Then he will journey through no lighted land
Nor see the sun arise nor see it set
But he must ever watch the northern Bear
Who from her frozen height with jealous eye
Confronts the Dog and Hunter in the south
And is alone not dipt in ocean stream
And straight he will come down to ocean strand 
Ocean whose watery ring infolds the world
And on whose marge the ancient giants dwell
But he will reach its unknown northern shore
Far far beyond the outmost giant home
At the chinked fields of ice the wastes of snow
And he must fare across the dismal ice
Northward until he meets a stretching wall
Barring his way and in the wall a grate
But then he must dismount and on the ice
Tighten the girths of Sleipner Odin horse
And make him leap the grate and come within
And he will see stretch round him Hela realm
The plains of Niflheim where dwell the dead
And hear the roaring of the streams of hell
And he will see the feeble shadowy tribes
And Balder sitting crowned and Hela throne
Then must he not regard the wailful ghosts
Who all will flit like eddying leaves around
But he must straight accost their solemn queen
And pay her homage and entreat with prayers
Telling her all that grief they have in heaven
For Balder whom she holds by right below
If haply he may melt her heart with words
And make her yield and give him Balder back
She spoke but Hoder answered her and said 
Mother a dreadful way is this thou show'st
No journey for a sightless god to go
And straight the mother of the gods replied 
Therefore thyself thou shalt not go my son
But he whom first thou meetest when thou com'st
To Asgard and declar'st this hidden way
Shall go and I will be his guide unseen
She spoke and on her face let fall her veil
And bowed her head and sate with folded hands
But at the central hearth those women old
Who while the mother spake had ceased their toil
Began again to heap the sacred fire
And Hoder turned and left his mother house
Fensaler whose lit windows look to sea
And came again down to the roaring waves
And back along the beach to Asgard went
Pondering on that which Frea said should be
But night came down and darkened Asgard streets
Then from their loathed feast the gods arose
And lighted torches and took up the corpse
Of Balder from the floor of Odin hall
And laid it on a bier and bare him home
Through the fast-darkening streets to his own house
Breidablik on whose columns Balder graved
The enchantments that recall the dead to life
For wise he was and many curious arts
Postures of runes and healing herbs he knew
Unhappy but that art he did not know
To keep his own life safe and see the sun
There to his hall the gods brought Balder home
And each bespake him as he laid him down 
Would that ourselves O Balder we were borne
Home to our halls with torchlight by our kin
So thou might'st live and still delight the gods
They spake and each went home to his own house
But there was one the first of all the gods
For speed and Hermod was his name in heaven
Most fleet he was but now he went the last
Heavy in heart for Balder to his house
Which he in Asgard built him there to dwell
Against the harbor by the city-wall
Him the blind Hoder met as he came up
From the sea cityward and knew his step
Nor yet could Hermod see his brother face
For it grew dark but Hoder touched his arm
And as a spray of honeysuckle-flowers
Brushes across a tired traveller face
Who shuffles through the deep dew-moistened dust
On a May evening in the darkened lanes
And starts him that he thinks a ghost went by 
So Hoder brushed by Hermod side and said 
Take Sleipner Hermod and set forth with dawn
To Hela kingdom to ask Balder back
And they shall be thy guides who have the power
He spake and brushed soft by and disappeared
And Hermod gazed into the night and said 
Who is it utters through the dark his best
So quickly and will wait for no reply
The voice was like the unhappy Hoder voice
Howbeit I will see and do his hest
For there rang note divine in that command
So speaking the fleet-footed Hermod came
Home and lay down to sleep in his own house
And all the gods lay down in their own homes
And Hoder too came home distraught with grief
Loathing to meet at dawn the other gods
And he went in and shut the door and fixed
His sword upright and fell on it and died
But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin rose 
The throne from which his eye surveys the world 
And mounted Sleipner and in darkness rode
To Asgard And the stars came out in heaven
High over Asgard to light home the king
But fiercely Odin galloped moved in heart
And swift to Asgard to the gate he came
And terribly the hoofs of Sleipner rang
Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets
And the gods trembled on their golden beds
Hearing the wrathful Father coming home 
For dread for like a whirlwind Odin came
And to Valhalla gate he rode and left
Sleipner and Sleipner went to his own stall
And in Valhalla Odin laid him down
But in Breidablik Nanna Balder wife
Came with the goddesses who wrought her will
And stood by Balder lying on his bier
And at his head and feet she stationed scalds
Who in their lives were famous for their song
These o'er the corpse intoned a plaintive strain
A dirge and Nanna and her train replied
And far into the night they wailed their dirge
But when their souls were satisfied with wail
They went and laid them down and Nanna went
Into an upper chamber and lay down
And Frea sealed her tired lids with sleep
And 'twas when night is bordering hard on dawn
When air is chilliest and the stars sunk low
Then Balder spirit through the gloom drew near
In garb in form in feature as he was
Alive and still the rays were round his head
Which were his glorious mark in heaven he stood
Over against the curtain of the bed
And gazed on Nanna as she slept and spake 
Poor lamb thou sleepest and forgett'st thy woe
Tears stand upon the lashes of thine eyes
Tears wet the pillow by thy cheek but thou
Like a young child hast cried thyself to sleep
Sleep on I watch thee and am here to aid
Alive I kept not far from thee dear soul
Neither do I neglect thee now though dead
For with to-morrow dawn the gods prepare
To gather wood and build a funeral-pile
Upon my ship and burn my corpse with fire
That sad sole honor of the dead and thee
They think to burn and all my choicest wealth
With me for thus ordains the common rite
But it shall not be so but mild but swift
But painless shall a stroke from Frea come
To cut thy thread of life and free thy soul
And they shall burn thy corpse with mine not thee
And well I know that by no stroke of death
Tardy or swift wouldst thou be loath to die
So it restored thee Nanna to my side
Whom thou so well hast loved but I can smooth
Thy way and this at least my prayers avail
Yes and I fain would altogether ward
Death from thy head and with the gods in heaven
Prolong thy life though not by thee desired
But right bars this not only thy desire
Yet dreary Nanna is the life they lead
In that dim world in Hela mouldering realm
And doleful are the ghosts the troops of dead
Whom Hela with austere control presides
For of the race of gods is no one there
Save me alone and Hela solemn queen
For all the nobler souls of mortal men
On battle-field have met their death and now
Feast in Valhalla in my father hall
Only the inglorious sort are there below
The old the cowards and the weak are there 
Men spent by sickness or obscure decay
But even there O Nanna we might find
Some solace in each other look and speech
Wandering together through that gloomy world
And talking of the life we led in heaven
While we yet lived among the other gods
He spake and straight his lineaments began
To fade and Nanna in her sleep stretched out
Her arms towards him with a cry but he
Mournfully shook his head and disappeared
And as the woodman sees a little smoke
Hang in the air afield and disappear
So Balder faded in the night away
And Nanna on her bed sank back but then
Frea the mother of the gods with stroke
Painless and swift set free her airy soul
Which took on Balder track the way below
And instantly the sacred morn appeared
Forth from the east up the ascent of heaven
Day drove his courser with the shining mane
And in Valhalla from his gable-perch
The golden-crested cock began to crow
Hereafter in the blackest dead of night
With shrill and dismal cries that bird shall crow
Warning the gods that foes draw nigh to heaven
But now he crew at dawn a cheerful note
To wake the gods and heroes to their tasks
And all the gods and all the heroes woke
And from their beds the heroes rose and donned
Their arms and led their horses from the stall
And mounted them and in Valhalla court
Were ranged and then the daily fray began
And all day long they there are hacked and hewn
'Mid dust and groans and limbs lopped off and blood
But all at night return to Odin hall
Woundless and fresh such lot is theirs in heaven
And the Valkyries on their steeds went forth
Toward earth and fights of men and at their side
Skulda the youngest of the Nornies rode
And over Bifrost where is Heimdall watch
Past Midgard fortress down to earth they came
There through some battle-field where men fall fast
Their horses fetlock-deep in blood they ride
And pick the bravest warriors out for death
Whom they bring back with them at night to heaven
To glad the gods and feast in Odin hall
But the gods went not now as otherwhile
Into the tilt-yard where the heroes fought
To feast their eyes with looking on the fray
Nor did they to their judgment-place repair
By the ash Igdrasil in Ida plain
Where they hold council and give laws for men
But they went Odin first the rest behind
To the hall Gladheim which is built of gold
Where are in circle ranged twelve golden chairs
And in the midst one higher Odin throne
There all the gods in silence sate them down
And thus the Father of the ages spake 
Go quickly gods bring wood to the seashore
With all which it beseems the dead to have
And make a funeral-pile on Balder ship
On the twelfth day the gods shall burn his corpse
But Hermod thou take Sleipner and ride down
To Hela kingdom to ask Balder back
So said he and the gods arose and took
Axes and ropes and at their head came Thor
Shouldering his hammer which the giants know
Forth wended they and drave their steeds before
And up the dewy mountain tracks they fared
To the dark forests in the early dawn
And up and down and side and slant they roamed
And from the glens all day an echo came
Of crashing falls for with his hammer Thor
Smote 'mid the rocks the lichen-bearded pines
And burst their roots while to their tops the gods
Made fast the woven ropes and haled them down
And lopped their boughs and clove them on the sward
And bound the logs behind their steeds to draw
And drave them homeward and the snorting steeds
Went straining through the crackling brushwood down
And by the darkling forest-paths the gods
Followed and on their shoulders carried boughs
And they came out upon the plain and passed
Asgard and led their horses to the beach
And loosed them of their loads on the seashore
And ranged the wood in stacks by Balder ship
And every god went home to his own house
But when the gods were to the forest gone
Hermod led Sleipner from Valhalla forth
And saddled him before that Sleipner brooked
No meaner hand than Odin on his mane
On his broad back no lesser rider bore
Yet docile now he stood at Hermod side
Arching his neck and glad to be bestrode
Knowing the god they went to seek how dear
But Hermod mounted him and sadly fared
In silence up the dark untravelled road
Which branches from the north of heaven and went
All day and daylight waned and night came on
And all that night he rode and journeyed so
Nine days nine nights toward the northern ice
Through valleys deep-ingulfed by roaring streams
And on the tenth morn he beheld the bridge
Which spans with golden arches Giall stream
And on the bridge a damsel watching armed
In the strait passage at the farther end
Where the road issues between walling rocks
Scant space that warder left for passers-by
But as when cowherds in October drive
Their kine across a snowy mountain pass
To winter pasture on the southern side
And on the ridge a wagon chokes the way
Wedged in the snow then painfully the hinds
With goad and shouting urge their cattle past
Plunging through deep untrodden banks of snow
To right and left and warm steam fills the air 
So on the bridge that damsel blocked the way
And questioned Hermod as he came and said 
Who art thou on thy black and fiery horse
Under whose hoofs the bridge o'er Giall stream
Rumbles and shakes Tell me thy race and home
But yester-morn five troops of dead passed by
Bound on their way below to Hela realm
Nor shook the bridge so much as thou alone
And thou hast flesh and color on thy cheeks
Like men who live and draw the vital air
Nor look'st thou pale and wan like men deceased
Souls bound below my daily passers here
And the fleet-footed Hermod answered her 
O damsel Hermod am I called the son
Of Odin and my high-roofed house is built
Far hence in Asgard in the city of gods
And Sleipner Odin horse is this I ride
And I come sent this road on Balder track
Say then if he hath crossed thy bridge or no
He spake the warder of the bridge replied 
O Hermod rarely do the feet of gods
Or of the horses of the gods resound
Upon my bridge and when they cross I know
Balder hath gone this way and ta'en the road
Below there to the north toward Hela realm
From here the cold white mist can be discerned
Not lit with sun but through the darksome air
By the dim vapor-blotted light of stars
Which hangs over the ice where lies the road
For in that ice are lost those northern streams
Freezing and ridging in their onward flow
Which from the fountain of Vergelmer run
The spring that bubbles up by Hela throne
There are the joyless seats the haunt of ghosts
Hela pale swarms and there was Balder bound
Ride on pass free but he by this is there
She spake and stepped aside and left him room
And Hermod greeted her and galloped by
Across the bridge then she took post again
But northward Hermod rode the way below
And o'er a darksome tract which knows no sun
But by the blotted light of stars he fared
And he came down to ocean northern strand
At the drear ice beyond the giants' home
Thence on he journeyed o'er the fields of ice
Still north until he met a stretching wall
Barring his way and in the wall a grate
Then he dismounted and drew tight the girths
On the smooth ice of Sleipner Odin horse
And made him leap the grate and came within
And he beheld spread round him Hela realm
The plains of Niflheim where dwell the dead
And heard the thunder of the streams of hell
For near the wall the river of Roaring flows
Outmost the others near the centre run 
The Storm the Abyss the Howling and the Pain
These flow by Hela throne and near their spring
And from the dark flocked up the shadowy tribes
And as the swallows crowd the bulrush-beds
Of some clear river issuing from a lake
On autumn-days before they cross the sea
And to each bulrush-crest a swallow hangs
Swinging and others skim the river-streams
And their quick twittering fills the banks and shores 
So around Hermod swarmed the twittering ghosts
Women and infants and young men who died
Too soon for fame with white ungraven shields
And old men known to glory but their star
Betrayed them and of wasting age they died
Not wounds yet dying they their armor wore
And now have chief regard in Hela realm
Behind flocked wrangling up a piteous crew
Greeted of none disfeatured and forlorn 
Cowards who were in sloughs interred alive
And round them still the wattled hurdles hung
Wherewith they stamped them down and trod them deep
To hide their shameful memory from men
But all he passed unhailed and reached the throne
Of Hela and saw near it Balder crowned
And Hela set thereon with countenance stern
And thus bespake him first the solemn queen 
Unhappy how hast thou endured to leave
The light and journey to the cheerless land
Where idly flit about the feeble shades
How didst thou cross the bridge o'er Giall stream
Being alive and come to ocean shore
Or how o'erleap the grate that bars the wall
She spake but down off Sleipner Hermod sprang
And fell before her feet and clasped her knees
And spake and mild entreated her and said 
O Hela wherefore should the gods declare
Their errands to each other or the ways
They go the errand and the way is known
Thou know'st thou know'st what grief we have in heaven
For Balder whom thou hold'st by right below
Restore him for what part fulfils he here
Shall he shed cheer over the cheerless seats
And touch the apathetic ghosts with joy
Not for such end O queen thou hold'st thy realm
For heaven was Balder born the city of gods
And heroes where they live in light and joy
Thither restore him for his place is there
He spoke and grave replied the solemn queen 
Hermod for he thou art thou son of heaven
A strange unlikely errand sure is thine
Do the gods send to me to make them blest
Small bliss my race hath of the gods obtained
Three mighty children to my father Lok
Did Angerbode the giantess bring forth 
Fenris the wolf the serpent huge and me
Of these the serpent in the sea ye cast
Who since in your despite hath waxed amain
And now with gleaming ring infolds the world
Me on this cheerless nether world ye threw
And gave me nine unlighted realms to rule
While on his island in the lake afar
Made fast to the bored crag by wile not strength
Subdued with limber chains lives Fenris bound
Lok still subsists in heaven our father wise
Your mate though loathed and feasts in Odin hall
But him too foes await and netted snares
And in a cave a bed of needle-rocks
And o'er his visage serpents dropping gall
Yet he shall one day rise and burst his bonds
And with himself set us his offspring free
When he guides Muspel children to their bourne
Till then in peril or in pain we live
Wrought by the gods and ask the gods our aid
Howbeit we abide our day till then
We do not as some feebler haters do 
Seek to afflict our foes with petty pangs
Helpless to better us or ruin them
Come then if Balder was so dear beloved
And this is true and such a loss is heaven 
Hear how to heaven may Balder be restored
Show me through all the world the signs of grief
Fails but one thing to grieve here Balder stops
Let all that lives and moves upon the earth
Weep him and all that is without life weep
Let gods men brutes beweep him plants and stones
So shall I know the lost was dear indeed
And bend my heart and give him back to heaven
She spake and Hermod answered her and said 
Hela such as thou say'st the terms shall be
But come declare me this and truly tell
May I ere I depart bid Balder hail
Or is it here withheld to greet the dead
He spake and straightway Hela answered him 
Hermod greet Balder if thou wilt and hold
Converse his speech remains though he be dead
And straight to Balder Hermod turned and spake
Even in the abode of death O Balder hail
Thou hear'st if hearing like as speech is thine
The terms of thy releasement hence to heaven
Fear nothing but that all shall be fulfilled
For not unmindful of thee are the gods
Who see the light and blest in Asgard dwell
Even here they seek thee out in Hela realm
And sure of all the happiest far art thou
Who ever have been known in earth or heaven
Alive thou wast of gods the most beloved
And now thou sittest crowned by Hela side
Here and hast honor among all the dead
He spake and Balder uttered him reply
But feebly as a voice far off he said 
Hermod the nimble gild me not my death
Better to live a serf a captured man
Who scatters rushes in a master hall
Than be a crowned king here and rule the dead
And now I count not of these terms as safe
To be fulfilled nor my return as sure
Though I be loved and many mourn my death
For double-minded ever was the seed
Of Lok and double are the gifts they give
Howbeit report thy message and therewith
To Odin to my father take this ring
Memorial of me whether saved or no
And tell the heaven-born gods how thou hast seen
Me sitting here below by Hela side
Crowned having honor among all the dead
He spake and raised his hand and gave the ring
And with inscrutable regard the queen
Of hell beheld them and the ghosts stood dumb
But Hermod took the ring and yet once more
Kneeled and did homage to the solemn queen
Then mounted Sleipner and set forth to ride
Back through the astonished tribes of dead to heaven
And to the wall he came and found the grate
Lifted and issued on the fields of ice
And o'er the ice he fared to ocean strand
And up from thence a wet and misty road
To the armed damsel bridge and Giall stream
Worse was that way to go than to return
For him for others all return is barred
Nine days he took to go two to return
And on the twelfth morn saw the light of heaven
And as a traveller in the early dawn
To the steep edge of some great valley comes
Through which a river flows and sees beneath
Clouds of white rolling vapors fill the vale
But o'er them on the farther slope descries
Vineyards and crofts and pastures bright with sun 
So Hermod o'er the fog between saw heaven
And Sleipner snorted for he smelt the air
Of heaven and mightily as winged he flew
And Hermod saw the towers of Asgard rise
And he drew near and heard no living voice
In Asgard and the golden halls were dumb
Then Hermod knew what labor held the gods
And through the empty streets he rode and passed
Under the gate-house to the sands and found
The gods on the seashore by Balder ship
The gods held talk together grouped in knots
Round Balder corpse which they had thither borne
And Hermod came down towards them from the gate
And Lok the father of the serpent first
Beheld him come and to his neighbor spake 
See here is Hermod who comes single back
From hell and shall I tell thee how he seems
Like as a farmer who hath lost his dog
Some morn at market in a crowded town 
Through many streets the poor beast runs in vain
And follows this man after that for hours
And late at evening spent and panting falls
Before a stranger threshold not his home
With flanks a-tremble and his slender tongue
Hangs quivering out between his dust-smeared jaws
And piteously he eyes the passers-by
But home his master comes to his own farm
Far in the country wondering where he is 
So Hermod comes to-day unfollowed home
And straight his neighbor moved with wrath replied 
Deceiver fair in form but false in heart
Enemy mocker whom though gods we hate 
Peace lest our father Odin hear thee gibe
Would I might see him snatch thee in his hand
And bind thy carcass like a bale with cords
And hurl thee in a lake to sink or swim
If clear from plotting Balder death to swim
But deep if thou devisedst it to drown
And perish against fate before thy day
So they two soft to one another spake
But Odin looked toward the land and saw
His messenger and he stood forth and cried
And Hermod came and leapt from Sleipner down
And in his father hand put Sleipner rein
And greeted Odin and the gods and said 
Odin my father and ye gods of heaven
Lo home having performed your will I come
Into the joyless kingdom have I been
Below and looked upon the shadowy tribes
Of ghosts and communed with their solemn queen
And to your prayer she sends you this reply 
Show her through all the world the signs of grief
Fails but one thing to grieve there Balder stops
Let gods men brutes beweep him plants and stones
So shall she know your loss was dear indeed
And bend her heart and give you Balder back
He spoke and all the gods to Odin looked
And straight the Father of the ages said 
Ye gods these terms may keep another day
But now put on your arms and mount your steeds
And in procession all come near and weep
Balder for that is what the dead desire
When ye enough have wept then build a pile
Of the heaped wood and burn his corpse with fire
Out of our sight that we may turn from grief
And lead as erst our daily life in heaven
He spoke and the gods armed and Odin donned
His dazzling corslet and his helm of gold
And led the way on Sleipner and the rest
Followed in tears their father and their king
And thrice in arms around the dead they rode
Weeping the sands were wetted and their arms
With their thick-falling tears so good a friend
They mourned that day so bright so loved a god
And Odin came and laid his kingly hands
On Balder breast and thus began the wail 
Farewell O Balder bright and loved my son
In that great day the twilight of the gods
When Muspel children shall beleaguer heaven
Then we shall miss thy counsel and thy arm
Thou camest near the next O warrior Thor
Shouldering thy hammer in thy chariot drawn
Swaying the long-haired goats with silvered rein
And over Balder corpse these words didst say 
Brother thou dwellest in the darksome land
And talkest with the feeble tribes of ghosts
Now and I know not how they prize thee there 
But here I know thou wilt be missed and mourned
For haughty spirits and high wraths are rife
Among the gods and heroes here in heaven
As among those whose joy and work is war
And daily strifes arise and angry words
But from thy lips O Balder night or day
Heard no one ever an injurious word
To god or hero but thou keptest back
The others laboring to compose their brawls
Be ye then kind as Balder too was kind
For we lose him who smoothed all strife in heaven
He spake and all the gods assenting wailed
And Freya next came nigh with golden tears
The loveliest goddess she in heaven by all
Most honored after Frea Odin wife
Her long ago the wandering Oder took
To mate but left her to roam distant lands
Since then she seeks him and weeps tears of gold
Names hath she many Vanadis on earth
They call her Freya is her name in heaven
She in her hands took Balder head and spake 
Balder my brother thou art gone a road
Unknown and long and haply on that way
My long-lost wandering Oder thou hast met
For in the paths of heaven he is not found
Oh if it be so tell him what thou wast
To his neglected wife and what he is
And wring his heart with shame to hear thy word
For he my husband left me here to pine
Not long a wife when his unquiet heart
First drove him from me into distant lands
Since then I vainly seek him through the world
And weep from shore to shore my golden tears
But neither god nor mortal heeds my pain
Thou only Balder wast forever kind
To take my hand and wipe my tears and say 
Weep not O Freya weep no golden tears
One day the wandering Oder will return
Or thou wilt find him in thy faithful search
On some great road or resting in an inn
Or at a ford or sleeping by a tree
So Balder said but Oder well I know
My truant Oder I shall see no more
To the world end and Balder now is gone
And I am left uncomforted in heaven
She spake and all the goddesses bewailed
Last from among the heroes one came near
No god but of the hero-troop the chief 
Regner who swept the northern sea with fleets
And ruled o'er Denmark and the heathy isles
Living but Ella captured him and slew 
A king whose fame then filled the vast of heaven
Now time obscures it and men later deeds
He last approached the corpse and spake and said 
Balder there yet are many scalds in heaven
Still left and that chief scald thy brother Brage
Whom we may bid to sing though thou art gone
And all these gladly while we drink we hear
After the feast is done in Odin hall
But they harp ever on one string and wake
Remembrance in our soul of wars alone
Such as on earth we valiantly have waged
And blood and ringing blows and violent death
But when thou sangest Balder thou didst strike
Another note and like a bird in spring
Thy voice of joyance minded us and youth
And wife and children and our ancient home
Yes and I too remembered then no more
My dungeon where the serpents stung me dead
Nor Ella victory on the English coast
But I heard Thora laugh in Gothland Isle
And saw my shepherdess Aslauga tend
Her flock along the white Norwegian beach
Tears started to mine eyes with yearning joy
Therefore with grateful heart I mourn thee dead
So Regner spake and all the heroes groaned
But now the sun had passed the height of heaven
And soon had all that day been spent in wail
But then the Father of the ages said 
Ye gods there well may be too much of wail
Bring now the gathered wood to Balder ship
Heap on the deck the logs and build the pyre
But when the gods and heroes heard they brought
The wood to Balder ship and built a pile
Full the deck breadth and lofty then the corpse
Of Balder on the highest top they laid
With Nanna on his right and on his left
Hoder his brother whom his own hand slew
And they set jars of wine and oil to lean
Against the bodies and stuck torches near
Splinters of pine-wood soaked with turpentine
And brought his arms and gold and all his stuff
And slew the dogs who at his table fed
And his horse Balder horse whom most he loved
And threw them on the pyre and Odin threw
A last choice gift thereon his golden ring
The mast they fixed and hoisted up the sails
Then they put fire to the wood and Thor
Set his stout shoulder hard against the stern
To push the ship through the thick sand sparks flew
From the deep trench she ploughed so strong a god
Furrowed it and the water gurgled in
And the ship floated on the waves and rocked
But in the hills a strong east-wind arose
And came down moaning to the sea first squalls
Ran black o'er the sea face then steady rushed
The breeze and filled the sails and blew the fire
And wreathed in smoke the ship stood out to sea
Soon with a roaring rose the mighty fire
And the pile crackled and between the logs
Sharp quivering tongues of flame shot out and leapt
Curling and darting higher until they licked
The summit of the pile the dead the mast
And ate the shrivelling sails but still the ship
Drove on ablaze above her hull with fire
And the gods stood upon the beach and gazed
And while they gazed the sun went lurid down
Into the smoke-wrapt sea and night came on
Then the wind fell with night and there was calm
But through the dark they watched the burning ship
Still carried o'er the distant waters on
Farther and farther like an eye of fire
And long in the far dark blazed Balder pile
But fainter as the stars rose high it flared
The bodies were consumed ash choked the pile
And as in a decaying winter-fire
A charred log falling makes a shower of sparks 
So with a shower of sparks the pile fell in
Reddening the sea around and all was dark
But the gods went by starlight up the shore
To Asgard and sate down in Odin hall
At table and the funeral-feast began
All night they ate the boar Serimner flesh
And from their horns with silver rimmed drank mead
Silent and waited for the sacred morn
And morning over all the world was spread
Then from their loathed feast the gods arose
And took their horses and set forth to ride
O'er the bridge Bifrost where is Heimdall watch
To the ash Igdrasil and Ida plain
Thor came on foot the rest on horseback rode
And they found Mimir sitting by his fount
Of wisdom which beneath the ash-tree springs
And saw the Nornies watering the roots
Of that world-shadowing tree with honey-dew
There came the gods and sate them down on stones
And thus the Father of the ages said 
Ye gods the terms ye know which Hermod brought
Accept them or reject them both have grounds
Accept them and they bind us unfulfilled
To leave forever Balder in the grave
An unrecovered prisoner shade with shades
But how ye say should the fulfilment fail 
Smooth sound the terms and light to be fulfilled
For dear-beloved was Balder while he lived
In heaven and earth and who would grudge him tears
But from the traitorous seed of Lok they come
These terms and I suspect some hidden fraud
Bethink ye gods is there no other way
Speak were not this a way the way for gods 
If I if Odin clad in radiant arms
Mounted on Sleipner with the warrior Thor
Drawn in his car beside me and my sons
All the strong brood of heaven to swell my train
Should make irruption into Hela realm
And set the fields of gloom ablaze with light
And bring in triumph Balder back to heaven
He spake and his fierce sons applauded loud
But Frea mother of the gods arose
Daughter and wife of Odin thus she said 
Odin thou whirlwind what a threat is this
Thou threatenest what transcends thy might even thine
For of all powers the mightiest far art thou
Lord over men on earth and gods in heaven
Yet even from thee thyself hath been withheld
One thing to undo what thou thyself hast ruled
For all which hath been fixed was fixed by thee
In the beginning ere the gods were born
Before the heavens were builded thou didst slay
The giant Ymir whom the abyss brought forth 
Thou and thy brethren fierce the sons of Bor 
And cast his trunk to choke the abysmal void
But of his flesh and members thou didst build
The earth and ocean and above them heaven
And from the flaming world where Muspel reigns
Thou sent'st and fetchedst fire and madest lights
Sun moon and stars which thou hast hung in heaven
Dividing clear the paths of night and day
And Asgard thou didst build and Midgard fort
Then me thou mad'st of us the gods were born
Last walking by the sea thou foundest spars
Of wood and framedst men who till the earth
Or on the sea the field of pirates sail
And all the race of Ymir thou didst drown
Save one Bergelmer he on shipboard fled
Thy deluge and from him the giants sprang
But all that brood thou hast removed far off
And set by ocean utmost marge to dwell
But Hela into Niflheim thou threw'st
And gav'st her nine unlighted worlds to rule
A queen and empire over all the dead
That empire wilt thou now invade light up
Her darkness from her grasp a subject tear
Try it but I for one will not applaud
Nor do I merit Odin thou shouldst slight
Me and my words though thou be first in heaven
For I too am a goddess born of thee
Thine eldest and of me the gods are sprung
And all that is to come I know but lock
In mine own breast and have to none revealed
Come then since Hela holds by right her prey
But offers terms for his release to heaven
Accept the chance thou canst no more obtain
Send through the world thy messengers entreat
All living and unliving things to weep
For Balder if thou haply thus may'st melt
Hela and win the loved one back to heaven
She spake and on her face let fall her veil
And bowed her head and sate with folded hands
Nor did the all-ruling Odin slight her word
Straightway he spake and thus addressed the gods 
Go quickly forth through all the world and pray
All living and unliving things to weep
Balder if haply he may thus be won
When the gods heard they straight arose and took
Their horses and rode forth through all the world
North south east west they struck and roamed the world
Entreating all things to weep Balder death
And all that lived and all without life wept
And as in winter when the frost breaks up
At winter end before the spring begins
And a warm west-wind blows and thaw sets in
After an hour a dripping sound is heard
In all the forests and the soft-strewn snow
Under the trees is dibbled thick with holes
And from the boughs the snow-loads shuffle down
And in fields sloping to the south dark plots
Of grass peep out amid surrounding snow
And widen and the peasant heart is glad 
So through the world was heard a dripping noise
Of all things weeping to bring Balder back
And there fell joy upon the gods to hear
But Hermod rode with Niord whom he took
To show him spits and beaches of the sea
Far off where some unwarned might fail to weep 
Niord the god of storms whom fishers know
Not born in heaven he was in Vanheim reared
With men but lives a hostage with the gods
He knows each frith and every rocky creek
Fringed with dark pines and sands where seafowl scream 
They two scoured every coast and all things wept
And they rode home together through the wood
Of Jarnvid which to east of Midgard lies
Bordering the giants where the trees are iron
There in the wood before a cave they came
Where sate in the cave mouth a skinny hag
Toothless and old she gibes the passers-by
Thok is she called but now Lok wore her shape
She greeted them the first and laughed and said 
Ye gods good lack is it so dull in heaven
That ye come pleasuring to Thok iron wood
Lovers of change ye are fastidious sprites
Look as in some boor yard a sweet-breathed cow
Whose manger is stuffed full of good fresh hay
Snuffs at it daintily and stoops her head
To chew the straw her litter at her feet 
So ye grow squeamish gods and sniff at heaven
She spake but Hermod answered her and said 
Thok not for gibes we come we come for tears
Balder is dead and Hela holds her prey
But will restore if all things give him tears
Begrudge not thine to all was Balder dear
Then with a louder laugh the hag replied 
Is Balder dead and do ye come for tears
Thok with dry eyes will weep o'er Balder pyre
Weep him all other things if weep they will
I weep him not let Hela keep her prey
She spake and to the cavern depth she fled
Mocking and Hermod knew their toil was vain
And as seafaring men who long have wrought
In the great deep for gain at last come home
And towards evening see the headlands rise
Of their dear country and can plain descry
A fire of withered furze which boys have lit
Upon the cliffs or smoke of burning weeds
Out of a tilled field inland then the wind
Catches them and drives out again to sea
And they go long days tossing up and down
Over the gray sea-ridges and the glimpse
Of port they had makes bitterer far their toil 
So the gods' cross was bitterer for their joy
Then sad at heart to Niord Hermod spake 
It is the accuser Lok who flouts us all
Ride back and tell in heaven this heavy news
I must again below to Hela realm
He spoke and Niord set forth back to heaven
But northward Hermod rode the way below
The way he knew and traversed Giall stream
And down to ocean groped and crossed the ice
And came beneath the wall and found the grate
Still lifted well was his return foreknown
And once more Hermod saw around him spread
The joyless plains and heard the streams of hell
But as he entered on the extremest bound
Of Niflheim he saw one ghost come near
Hovering and stopping oft as if afraid 
Hoder the unhappy whom his own hand slew
And Hermod looked and knew his brother ghost
And called him by his name and sternly said 
Hoder ill-fated blind in heart and eyes
Why tarriest thou to plunge thee in the gulf
Of the deep inner gloom but flittest here
In twilight on the lonely verge of hell
Far from the other ghosts and Hela throne
Doubtless thou fearest to meet Balder voice
Thy brother whom through folly thou didst slay
He spoke but Hoder answered him and said 
Hermod the nimble dost thou still pursue
The unhappy with reproach even in the grave
For this I died and fled beneath the gloom
Not daily to endure abhorring gods
Nor with a hateful presence cumber heaven
And canst thou not even here pass pitying by
No less than Balder have I lost the light
Of heaven and communion with my kin
I too had once a wife and once a child
And substance and a golden house in heaven
But all I left of my own act and fled
Below and dost thou hate me even here
Balder upbraids me not nor hates at all
Though he has cause have any cause but he
When that with downcast looks I hither came
Stretched forth his hand and with benignant voice
Welcome he said if there be welcome here
Brother and fellow-sport of Lok with me
And not to offend thee Hermod nor to force
My hated converse on thee came I up
From the deep gloom where I will now return
But earnestly I longed to hover near
Not too far off when that thou camest by
To feel the presence of a brother god
And hear the passage of a horse of heaven
For the last time for here thou com'st no more
He spake and turned to go to the inner gloom
But Hermod stayed him with mild words and said 
Thou doest well to chide me Hoder blind
Truly thou say'st the planning guilty mind
Was Lok the unwitting hand alone was thine
But gods are like the sons of men in this
When they have woe they blame the nearest cause
Howbeit stay and be appeased and tell
Sits Balder still in pomp by Hela side
Or is he mingled with the unnumbered dead
And the blind Hoder answered him and spake 
His place of state remains by Hela side
But empty for his wife for Nanna came
Lately below and joined him and the pair
Frequent the still recesses of the realm
Of Hela and hold converse undisturbed
But they too doubtless will have breathed the balm
Which floats before a visitant from heaven
And have drawn upward to this verge of hell
He spake and as he ceased a puff of wind
Rolled heavily the leaden mist aside
Round where they stood and they beheld two forms
Make toward them o'er the stretching cloudy plain
And Hermod straight perceived them who they were 
Balder and Nanna and to Balder said 
Balder too truly thou foresaw'st a snare
Lok triumphs still and Hela keeps her prey
No more to Asgard shalt thou come nor lodge
In thy own house Breidablik nor enjoy
The love all bear toward thee nor train up
Forset thy son to be beloved like thee
Here must thou lie and wait an endless age
Therefore for the last time O Balder hail
He spake and Balder answered him and said 
Hail and farewell for here thou com'st no more
Yet mourn not for me Hermod when thou sitt'st
In heaven nor let the other gods lament
As wholly to be pitied quite forlorn
For Nanna hath rejoined me who of old
In heaven was seldom parted from my side
And still the acceptance follows me which crowned
My former life and cheers me even here
The iron frown of Hela is relaxed
When I draw nigh and the wan tribes of dead
Love me and gladly bring for my award
Their ineffectual feuds and feeble hates 
Shadows of hates but they distress them still
And the fleet-footed Hermod made reply 
Thou hast then all the solace death allows 
Esteem and function and so far is well
Yet here thou liest Balder underground
Rusting forever and the years roll on
The generations pass the ages grow
And bring us nearer to the final day
When from the south shall march the fiery band
And cross the bridge of heaven with Lok for guide
And Fenris at his heel with broken chain
While from the east the giant Rymer steers
His ship and the great serpent makes to land
And all are marshalled in one flaming square
Against the gods upon the plains of heaven
I mourn thee that thou canst not help us then
He spake but Balder answered him and said 
Mourn not for me Mourn Hermod for the gods
Mourn for the men on earth the gods in heaven
Who live and with their eyes shall see that day
The day will come when fall shall Asgard towers
And Odin and his sons the seed of heaven
But what were I to save them in that hour
If strength might save them could not Odin save
My father and his pride the warrior Thor
Vidar the silent the impetuous Tyr
I what were I when these can naught avail
Yet doubtless when the day of battle comes
And the two hosts are marshalled and in heaven
The golden-crested cock shall sound alarm
And his black brother-bird from hence reply
And bucklers clash and spears begin to pour 
Longing will stir within my breast though vain
But not to me so grievous as I know
To other gods it were is my enforced
Absence from fields where I could nothing aid
For I am long since weary of your storm
Of carnage and find Hermod in your life
Something too much of war and broils which make
Life one perpetual fight a bath of blood
Mine eyes are dizzy with the arrowy hail
Mine ears are stunned with blows and sick for calm
Inactive therefore let me lie in gloom
Unarmed inglorious I attend the course
Of ages and my late return to light
In times less alien to a spirit mild
In new-recovered seats the happier day
He spake and the fleet Hermod thus replied 
Brother what seats are these what happier day
Tell me that I may ponder it when gone
And the ray-crowned Balder answered him 
Far to the south beyond the blue there spreads
Another heaven the boundless No one yet
Hath reached it There hereafter shall arise
The second Asgard with another name
Thither when o'er this present earth and heavens
The tempest of the latter days hath swept
And they from sight have disappeared and sunk
Shall a small remnant of the gods repair
Hoder and I shall join them from the grave
There re-assembling we shall see emerge
From the bright ocean at our feet an earth
More fresh more verdant than the last with fruits
Self-springing and a seed of man preserved
Who then shall live in peace as now in war
But we in heaven shall find again with joy
The ruined palaces of Odin seats
Familiar halls where we have supped of old
Re-enter them with wonder never fill
Our eyes with gazing and rebuild with tears
And we shall tread once more the well-known plain
Of Ida and among the grass shall find
The golden dice wherewith we played of yore
And that will bring to mind the former life
And pastime of the gods the wise discourse
Of Odin the delights of other days
O Hermod pray that thou may'st join us then
Such for the future is my hope meanwhile
I rest the thrall of Hela and endure
Death and the gloom which round me even now
Thickens and to its inner gulf recalls
Farewell for longer speech is not allowed
He spoke and waved farewell and gave his hand
To Nanna and she gave their brother blind
Her hand in turn for guidance and the three
Departed o'er the cloudy plain and soon
Faded from sight into the interior gloom
But Hermod stood beside his drooping horse
Mute gazing after them in tears and fain
Fain had he followed their receding steps
Though they to death were bound and he to heaven
Then but a power he could not break withheld
And as a stork which idle boys have trapped
And tied him in a yard at autumn sees
Flocks of his kind pass flying o'er his head
To warmer lands and coasts that keep the sun
He strains to join their flight and from his shed
Follows them with a long complaining cry 
So Hermod gazed and yearned to join his kin
At last he sighed and set forth back to heaven
There clear as night beholds her crowning seven
The sea beheld his likeness set in heaven
The shadow of his spirit full in sight
Shone for the shadow of that soul is light
Nor heaven alone bore witness earth avowed
Him present and acclaimed of storm aloud
From the arching sky to the ageless hills and sea
The whole world visible audible was he
Each part of all that wove that wondrous whole
The raiment of the presence of his soul
The sun that smote and kissed the dark to death
Spake smiled and strove like song triumphant breath
The soundless cloud whose thunderous heart was dumb
Swelled lowered and shrank to feel its conqueror come
Yet high from heaven its empire vast and vain
Frowned and renounced not night reluctant reign
The serpentine swift sounds and shapes wherein
The stainless sea mocks earth and death and sin
Crawls dark as craft or flashes keen as hate
Subdued and insubmissive strong like fate
And weak like man bore wrathful witness yet
That storms and sins are more than suns that set
That evil everlasting girt for strife
Eternal wars with hope as death with life
The dark sharp shifting wind that bade the waves
Falter lose heart bow down like foes made slaves
And waxed within more bitter as they bowed
Baffling the sea swallowing the sun with cloud
Devouring fast as fire on earth devours
And hungering hard as frost that feeds on flowers
Clothed round with fog that reeked as fume from hell
And darkening with its miscreative spell
Light glad and keen and splendid as the sword
Whose heft had known Othello hand its lord
Spake all the soul that hell drew back to greet
And felt its fire shrink shuddering from his feet
Far off the darkness darkened and recoiled
And neared again and triumphed and the coiled
Colourless cloud and sea discoloured grew
Conscious of horror huge as heaven and knew
Where Goneril soul made chill and foul the mist
And all the leprous life in Regan hissed
Fierce homeless ghosts rejected of the pit
From hell to hell of storm fear watched them flit
About them and before the dull grey gloom
Shuddered and heaven seemed hateful as the tomb
That shrinks from resurrection and from out
That sullen hell which girt their shades about
The nether soul that lurks and lowers within
Man made of dust and fire and shame and sin
Breathed all the cloud that felt it breathe and blight
Was blue as plague or black as thunderous night
Elect of hell the children of his hate
Thronged as to storm sweet heaven triumphal gate
The terror of his giving rose and shone
Imminent life had put its likeness on
But higher than all its horrent height of shade
Shone sovereign seen by light itself had made
Above the woes of all the world above
Life sin and death his myriad-minded love
From landward heights whereon the radiance leant
Full-fraught from heaven intense and imminent
To depths wherein the seething strengths of cloud
Scarce matched the wrath of waves whereon they bowed
From homeborn pride and kindling love of home
To the outer skies and seas of fire and foam
From splendour soft as dew that sundawn thrills
To gloom that shudders round the world it fills
From midnights murmuring round Titania ear
To midnights maddening round the rage of Lear
The wonder woven of storm and sun became
One with the light that lightens from his name
The music moving on the sea that felt
The storm-wind even as snows of springtide melt
Was blithe as Ariel hand or voice might make
And bid all grief die gladly for its sake
And there the soul alive in ear and eye
That watched the wonders of an hour pass by
Saw brighter than all stars that heaven inspheres
The silent splendour of Cordelia tears
Felt in the whispers of the quickening wind
The radiance of the laugh of Rosalind
And heard in sounds that melt the souls of men
With love of love the tune of Imogen
Auvergne Auvergne O wild and woful land
O glorious land and gracious white as gleam
The stairs of heaven black as a flameless brand
Strange even as life and stranger than a dream
Could earth remember man whose eyes made bright
The splendour of her beauty lit by day
Or soothed and softened and redeemed by night
Wouldst thou not know what light has passed away
Wouldst thou not know whom England whom the world
Mourns For the world whose wildest ways he trod
And smiled their dangers down that coiled and curled
Against him knows him now less man than god
Our demigod of daring keenest-eyed
To read and deepest read in earth dim things
A spirit now whose body of death has died
And left it mightier yet in eyes and wings
The sovereign seeker of the world who now
Hath sought what world the light of death may show
Hailed once with me the crowns that load thy brow
Crags dark as midnight columns bright as snow
Thy steep small Siena splendid and content
As shines the mightier city Tuscan pride
Which here its face reflects in radiance pent
By narrower bounds from towering side to side
Set fast between the ridged and foamless waves
Of earth more fierce and fluctuant than the sea
The fearless town of towers that hails and braves
The heights that gird the sun that brands Le Puy
The huddled churches clinging on the cliffs
As birds alighting might for storm sake cling
Moored to the rocks as tempest-harried skiffs
To perilous refuge from the loud wind wing
The stairs on stairs that wind and change and climb
Even up to the utmost crag edge curved and curled
More bright than vision more than faith sublime
Strange as the light and darkness of the world
Strange as are night and morning stars and sun
And washed from west and east by day deep tide
Shine yet less fair when all their heights are won
Than sundawn shows thy pillared mountain-side
Even so the dawn of death whose light makes dim
The starry fires that life sees rise and set
Shows higher than here he shone before us him
Whom faith forgets not nor shall fame forget
Even so those else unfooted heights we clomb
Through scudding mist and eddying whirls of cloud
Blind as a pilot beaten blind with foam
And shrouded as a corpse with storm grey shroud
Foot following foot along the sheer strait ledge
Where space was none to bear the wild goat feet
Till blind we sat on the outer footless edge
Where darkling death seemed fain to share the seat
The abyss before us viewless even as time's
The abyss to left of us the abyss to right
Bid thought now dream how high the freed soul climbs
That death sets free from change of day and night
The might of raging mist and wind whose wrath
Shut from our eyes the narrowing rock we trod
The wondrous world it darkened made our path
Like theirs who take the shadow of death for God
Yet eastward veiled in vapour white as snow
The grim black herbless heights that scorn the sun
And mock the face of morning rose to show
The work of earth-born fire and earthquake done
And half the world was haggard night wherein
We strove our blind way through but far above
Was light that watched the wild mists whirl and spin
And far beneath a land worth light and love
Deep down the Valley of the Curse undaunted
By shadow and whisper of winds with sins for wings
And ghosts of crime wherethrough the heights live haunted
By present sense of past and monstrous things
The glimmering water holds its gracious way
Full forth and keeps one happier hand's-breadth green
Of all that storm-scathed world whereon the sway
Sits dark as death of deadlier things unseen
But on the soundless and the viewless river
That bears through night perchance again to day
The dead whom death and twin-born fame deliver
From life that dies and time inveterate sway
No shadow save of falsehood and of fear
That brands the future with the past and bids
The spirit wither and the soul grow sere
Hovers or hangs to cloud life opening lids
If life have eyes to lift again and see
Beyond the bounds of sensual sight or breath
What life incognisable of ours may be
That turns our light to darkness deep as death
Priests and the soulless serfs of priests may swarm
With vulturous acclamation loud in lies
About his dust while yet his dust is warm
Who mocked as sunlight mocks their base blind eyes
Their godless ghost of godhead false and foul
As fear his dam or hell his throne but we
Scarce hearing heed no carrion church-wolf howl
The corpse be theirs to mock the soul is free
Free as ere yet its earthly day was done
It lived above the coil about us curled
A soul whose eyes were keener than the sun
A soul whose wings were wider than the world
We sons of east and west ringed round with dreams
Bound fast with visions girt about with fears
Live trust and think by chance while shadow seems
Light and the wind that wrecks a hand that steers
He whose full soul held east and west in poise
Weighed man with man and creed of man with creed
And age with age their triumphs and their toys
And found what faith may read not and may read
Scorn deep and strong as death and life that lit
With fire the smile at lies and dreams outworn
Wherewith he smote them showed sublime in it
The splendour and the steadfastness of scorn
What loftier heaven what lordlier air what space
Illimitable insuperable infinite
Now to that strong-winged soul yields ampler place
Than passing darkness yields to passing light
No dream no faith can tell us hope and fear
Whose tongues were loud of old as children now
From babbling fall to silence change is here
And death dark furrows drawn by time dark plough
Still sunward here on earth its flight was bent
Even since the man within the child began
To yearn and kindle with superb intent
And trust in time to magnify the man
Still toward the old garden of the Sun whose fruit
The honey-heavy lips of Sophocles
Desired and sang wherein the unwithering root
Sprang of all growths that thought brings forth and sees
Incarnate bright with bloom or dense with leaf
Far-shadowing deep as depth of dawn or night
And all were parcel of the garnered sheaf
His strenuous spirit bound and stored aright
And eastward now and ever toward the dawn
If death deep veil by life bright hand be rent
We see as through the shadow of death withdrawn
The imperious soul indomitable ascent
But not the soul whose labour knew not end 
But not the swordsman hand the crested head 
The royal heart we mourn the faultless friend
Burton a name that lives till fame be dead
With sense more keen and spirit of sight more true
Than burns and thrills in sunrise when the dew
Flames and absorbs the glory round it shed
As they the light of ages quick and dead
Closed now forsake us yet the shaft that slew
Can slay not one of all the works we knew
Nor death discrown that many-laurelled head
The works of words whose life seems lightning wrought
And moulded of unconquerable thought
And quickened with imperishable flame
Stand fast and shine and smile assured that nought
May fade of all their myriad-moulded fame
Nor England memory clasp not Browning name
Death what hast thou to do with one for whom
Time is not lord but servant What least part
Of all the fire that fed his living heart
Of all the light more keen than sundawn bloom
That lit and led his spirit strong as doom
And bright as hope can aught thy breath may dart
Quench Nay thou knowest he knew thee what thou art
A shadow born of terror barren womb
That brings not forth save shadows What art thou
To dream albeit thou breathe upon his brow
That power on him is given thee that thy breath
Can make him less than love acclaims him now
And hears all time sound back the word it saith
What part hast thou then in his glory Death
A graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve
Venice and winter hand in deadly hand
Have slain the lover of her sunbright strand
And singer of a stormbright Christmas Eve
A graceless guerdon we that loved receive
For all our love from that the dearest land
Love worshipped ever Blithe and soft and bland
Too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave
Shone on our dreams and memories evermore
The domes the towers the mountains and the shore
That gird or guard thee Venice cold and black
Seems now the face we loved as he of yore
We have given thee love no stint no stay no lack
What gift what gift is this thou hast given us back
But he to him who knows what gift is thine
Death Hardly may we think or hope when we
Pass likewise thither where to-night is he
Beyond the irremeable outer seas that shine
And darken round such dreams as half divine
Some sunlit harbour in that starless sea
Where gleams no ship to windward or to lee
To read with him the secret of thy shrine
There too as here may song delight and love
The nightingale the sea-bird and the dove
Fulfil with joy the splendour of the sky
Till all beneath wax bright as all above
But none of all that search the heavens and try
The sun may match the sovereign eagle eye
Among the wondrous ways of men and time
He went as one that ever found and sought
And bore in hand the lamplike spirit of thought
To illume with instance of its fire sublime
The dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime
No spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought
No faith no fear no dream no rapture nought
That blooms in wisdom nought that burns in crime
No virtue girt and armed and helmed with light
No love more lovely than the snows are white
No serpent sleeping in some dead soul tomb
No song-bird singing from some live soul height
But he might hear interpret or illume
With sense invasive as the dawn of doom
What secret thing of splendour or of shade
Surmised in all those wandering ways wherein
Man led of love and life and death and sin
Strays climbs or cowers allured absorbed afraid
Might not the strong and sunlike sense invade
Of that full soul that had for aim to win
Light silent over time dark toil and din
Life at whose touch death fades as dead things fade
O spirit of man what mystery moves in thee
That he might know not of in spirit and see
The heart within the heart that seems to strive
The life within the life that seems to be
And hear through all thy storms that whirl and drive
The living sound of all men souls alive
He held no dream worth waking so he said
He who stands now on death triumphal steep
Awakened out of life wherein we sleep
And dream of what he knows and sees being dead
But never death for him was dark or dread
Look forth he bade the soul and fear not Weep
All ye that trust not in his truth and keep
Vain memory vision of a vanished head
As all that lives of all that once was he
Save that which lightens from his word but we
Who seeing the sunset-coloured waters roll
Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea
Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole
And life and death but shadows of the soul
Love will not weep because the seal is broken
That sealed upon a life beloved and brief
Darkness and let but song break through for token
How deep too far for even thy song relief
Slept in thy soul the secret springs of grief
Thy song may soothe full many a soul hereafter
As tears if tears will come dissolve despair
As here but late with smile more bright than laughter
Thy sweet strange yearning eyes would seem to bear
Witness that joy might cleave the clouds of care
Two days agone and love was one with pity
When love gave thought wings toward the glimmering goal
Where as a shrine lit in some darkling city
Shone soft the shrouded image of thy soul
And now thou art healed of life thou art healed and whole
Yea two days since all we that loved thee pitied
And now with wondering love with shame of face
We think how foolish now how far unfitted
Should be from us toward thee who hast run thy race
Pity toward thee who hast won the painless place
The painless world of death yet unbeholden
Of eyes that dream what light now lightens thine
And will not weep Thought yearning toward those olden
Dear hours that sorrow sees and sees not shine
Bows tearless down before a flameless shrine
A flameless altar here of life and sorrow
Quenched and consumed together These were one
One thing for thee as night was one with morrow
And utter darkness with the sovereign sun
And now thou seest life sorrow and darkness done
And yet love yearns again to win thee hither
Blind love and loveless and unworthy thee
Here where I watch the hours of darkness wither
Here where mine eyes were glad and sad to see
Thine that could see not mine though turned on me
But now if aught beyond sweet sleep lie hidden
And sleep be sealed not fast on dead men sight
For ever thine hath grace for ours forbidden
And sees us compassed round with change and night
Yet light like thine is ours if love be light
Eyes not down-dropt nor over-bright but fed
With the clear-pointed flame of chastity
Clear without heat undying tended by
Pure vestal thoughts in the translucent fane
Of her still spirit locks not wide-dispread
Madonna-wise on either side her head
Sweet lips whereon perpetually did reign
The summer calm of golden charity
Were fixed shadows of thy fixed mood
Revered Isabel the crown and head
The stately flower of female fortitude
Of perfect wifehood and pure lowlihead
The intuitive decision of a bright
And thorough-edged intellect to part
Error from crime a prudence to withhold
The laws of marriage character'd in gold
Upon the blanched tablets of her heart
A love still burning upward giving light
To read those laws an accent very low
In blandishment but a most silver flow
Of subtle-paced counsel in distress
Right to the heart and brain tho' undescried
Winning its way with extreme gentleness
Thro' all the outworks of suspicious pride
A courage to endure and to obey
A hate of gossip parlance and of sway
Crown'd Isabel thro' all her placid life
The queen of marriage a most perfect wife
The mellow'd reflex of a winter moon
A clear stream flowing with a muddy one
Till in its onward current it absorbs
With swifter movement and in purer light
The vexed eddies of its wayward brother
A leaning and upbearing parasite
Clothing the stem which else had fallen quite
With cluster'd flower-bells and ambrosial orbs
Of rich fruit-bunches leaning on each other 
Shadow forth thee the world hath not another
Though all her fairest forms are types of thee
And thou of God in thy great charity
Of such a finish'd chasten'd purity
There lies a vale in Ida lovelier
Than all the valleys of Ionian hills
The swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen
Puts forth an arm and creeps from pine to pine
And loiters slowly drawn On either hand
The lawns and meadow-ledges midway down
Hang rich in flowers and far below them roars
The long brook falling thro' the clov'n ravine
In cataract after cataract to the sea
Behind the valley topmost Gargarus
Stands up and takes the morning but in front
The gorges opening wide apart reveal
Troas and Ilion column'd citadel
The crown of Troas Hither came at noon
Mournful Oenone wandering forlorn
Of Paris once her playmate on the hills
Her cheek had lost the rose and round her neck
Floated her hair or seem'd to float in rest
She leaning on a fragment twined with vine
Sang to the stillness till the mountain-shade
Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff
O mother Ida many-fountain'd Ida
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
For now the noonday quiet holds the hill
The grasshopper is silent in the grass
The lizard with his shadow on the stone
Rests like a shadow and the cicala sleeps
The purple flowers droop the golden bee
Is lily-cradled I alone awake
My eyes are full of tears my heart of love
My heart is breaking and my eyes are dim
And I am all aweary of my life
O mother Ida many-fountain'd Ida
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
Hear me O Earth hear me O Hills O Caves
That house the cold crown'd snake O mountain brooks
I am the daughter of a River-God
Hear me for I will speak and build up all
My sorrow with my song as yonder walls
Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed
A cloud that gather'd shape for it may be
That while I speak of it a little while
My heart may wander from its deeper woe
O mother Ida many-fountain'd Ida
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
I waited underneath the dawning hills
Aloft the mountain lawn was dewy-dark
And dewy-dark aloft the mountain pine
Beautiful Paris evil-hearted Paris
Leading a jet-black goat white-horn'd white-hooved
Came up from reedy Simois all alone
O mother Ida harken ere I die
Far-off the torrent call'd me from the cleft
Far up the solitary morning smote
The streaks of virgin snow With down-dropt eyes
I sat alone white-breasted like a star
Fronting the dawn he moved a leopard skin
Droop'd from his shoulder but his sunny hair
Cluster'd about his temples like a God's
And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens
When the wind blows the foam and all my heart
Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
He smiled and opening out his milk-white palm
Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold
That smelt ambrosially and while I look'd
And listen'd the full-flowing river of speech
Came down upon my heartMy own Oenone
Beautiful-brow'd Oenone my own soul
Behold this fruit whose gleaming rind ingrav'n
For the most fair would seem to award it thine
As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt
The knolls of Ida loveliest in all grace
Of movement and the charm of married brows'
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
He prest the blossom of his lips to mine
And added 'This was cast upon the board
When all the full-faced presence of the Gods
Ranged in the halls of Peleus whereupon
Rose feud with question unto whom 'twere due
But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve
Delivering that to me by common voice
Elected umpire Here comes to-day
Pallas and Aphrodite claiming each
This meed of fairest Thou within the cave
Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine
Mayst well behold them unbeheld unheard
Hear all and see thy Paris judge of Gods
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
It was the deep midnoon one silvery cloud
Had lost his way between the piney sides
Of this long glen Then to the bower they came
Naked they came to that smooth-swarded bower
And at their feet the crocus brake like fire
Violet amaracus and asphodel
Lotos and lilies and a wind arose
And overhead the wandering ivy and vine
This way and that in many a wild festoon
Ran riot garlanding the gnarled boughs
With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'
O mother Ida harken ere I die
On the tree-tops a crested peacock lit
And o'er him flow'd a golden cloud and lean'd
Upon him slowing dropping fragrant dew
Then first I heard the voice of her to whom
Coming thro' Heaven like a light that grows
Larger and clearer with one mind the Gods
Rise up for reverence She to Paris made
Proffer of royal power ample rule
Unquestion'd overflowing revenue
Wherewith to embellish state 'from many a vale
And river-sunder'd champaign clothed with corn
Or labour'd mines undrainable of ore
Honour' she said 'and homage tax and toll
From many an inland town and haven large
Mast-throng'd beneath her shadowing citadel
In glassy bays among her tallest towers
O mother Ida harken ere I die
Still she spake on and still she spake of power
'Which in all action is the end of all
Power fitted to the season wisdom-bred
And throned of wisdom from all neighbour crowns
Alliance and allegiance till thy hand
Fail from the sceptre staff Such boon from me
From me Heaven Queen Paris to thee king-born
A shepherd all thy life but yet king-born
Should come most welcome seeing men in power
Only are likest gods who have attain'd
Rest in a happy place and quiet seats
Above the thunder with undying bliss
In knowledge of their own supremacy
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
She ceased and Paris held the costly fruit
Out at arm's-length so much the thought of power
Flatter'd his spirit but Pallas where she stood
Somewhat apart her clear and bared limbs
O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear
Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold
The while above her full and earnesteye
Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek
Kept watch waiting decision made reply
'Self-reverence self-knowledge self-control
These three alone lead life to sovereign power
Yet not for power power of herself
Would come uncall'd for but to live by law
Acting the law we live by without fear
And because right is right to follow right
Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
Again she said 'I woo thee not with gifts
Sequel of guerdon could not alter me
To fairer Judge thou me by what I am
So shalt thou find me fairest Yet indeed
If gazing on divinity disrobed
Thy mortal eyes are frail to judge of fair
Unbiass'd by self-profit oh rest thee sure
That I shall love thee well and cleave to thee
So that my vigour wedded to thy blood
Shall strike within thy pulses like a God's
To push thee forward thro' a life of shocks
Dangers and deeds until endurance grow
Sinew'd with action and the full-grown will
Circled thro' all experiences pure law
Commeasure perfect freedom' Here she ceased
And Paris ponder'd and I cried 'O Paris
Give it to Pallas' but he heard me not
Or hearing would not hear me woe is me
O mother Ida many-fountain'd Ida
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
Idalian Aphrodite beautiful
Fresh as the foam new-bathed in Paphian wells
With rosy slender fingers backward drew
From her warm brows and bosom her deep hair
Ambrosial golden round her lucid throat
And shoulder from the violets her light foot
Shone rosy-white and o'er her rounded form
Between the shadows of the vine-bunches
Floated the glowing sunlights as she moved
Dear mother Ida harken ere I die
She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes
The herald of her triumph drawing nigh
Half-whisper'd in his ear 'I promise thee
The fairest and most loving wife in Greece'
She spoke and laugh'd I shut my sight for fear
But when I look'd Paris had raised his arm
And I beheld great Here angry eyes
As she withdrew into the golden cloud
And I was left alone within the bower
And from that time to this I am alone
And I shall be alone until I die
Yet mother Ida harken ere I die
Fairest why fairest wife am I not fair
My love hath told me so a thousand times
Methinks I must be fair for yesterday
When I past by a wild and wanton pard
Eyed like the evening star with playful tail
Crouch'd fawning in the weed Most loving is she
Ah me my mountain shepherd that my arms
Were wound about thee and my hot lips prest
Close close to thine in that quick-falling dew
Of fruitful kisses thick as Autumn rains
Flash in the pools of whirling Simois
O mother hear me yet before I die
They came they cut away my tallest pines
My dark tall pines that plumed the craggy ledge
High over the blue gorge and all between
The snowy peak and snow-white cataract
Foster'd the callow eaglet from beneath
Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn
The panther roar came muffled while I sat
Low in the valley Never never more
Shall lone Oenone see the morning mist
Sweep thro' them never see them overlaid
With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud
Between the loud stream and the trembling stars
O mother here me yet before I die
I wish that somewhere in the ruin'd folds
Among the fragments tumbled from the glens
Or the dry thickets I could meet with her
The Abominable that uninvited came
Into the fair Peleian banquet-hall
And cast the golden fruit upon the board
And bred this change that I might speak my mind
And tell her to her face how much I hate
Her presence hated both of Gods and men
O mother here me yet before I die
Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times
In this green valley under this green hill
Ev'n on this hand and sitting on this stone
Seal'd it with kisses water'd it with tears
O happy tears and how unlike to these
O happy Heaven how canst thou see my face
O happy earth how canst thou bear my weight
O death death death thou ever-floating cloud
There are enough unhappy on this earth
Pass by the happy souls that love to live
I pray thee pass before my light of life
And shadow all my soul that I may die
Thou weighest heavy on the heart within
Weigh heavy on my eyelids let me die
O mother hear me yet before I die
I will not die alone for fiery thoughts
Do shape themselves within me more and more
Whereof I catch the issue as I hear
Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills
Like footsteps upon wool I dimly see
My far-off doubtful purpose as a mother
Conjectures of the features of her child
Ere it is born her child a shudder comes
Across me never child be born of me
Unblest to vex me with his father eyes
O mother hear me yet before I die
Hear me O earth I will not die alone
Lest their shrill happy laughter come to me
Walking the cold and starless road of Death
Uncomforted leaving my ancient love
With the Greek woman I will rise and go
Down into Troy and ere the stars come forth
Talk with the wild Cassandra for she says
A fire dances before her and a sound
Rings ever in her ears of armed men
What this may be I know not but I know
That wheresoe'er I am by night and day
All earth and air seem only burning fire
There is a dale in Ida lovelier
Than any in old Ionia beautiful
With emerald slopes of sunny sward that lean
Above the loud glenriver which hath worn
A path thro' steepdown granite walls below
Mantled with flowering tendriltwine In front
The cedarshadowy valleys open wide
Far-seen high over all the God-built wall
And many a snowycolumned range divine
Mounted with awful sculptures men and Gods
The work of Gods bright on the dark-blue sky
The windy citadel of Ilion
Shone like the crown of Troas Hither came
Mournful Oenone wandering forlorn
Of Paris once her playmate Round her neck
Her neck all marblewhite and marblecold
Floated her hair or seemed to float in rest
She leaning on a vine-entwined stone
Sang to the stillness till the mountain-shadow
Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff
O mother Ida manyfountained Ida
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
The grasshopper is silent in the grass
The lizard with his shadow on the stone
Sleeps like a shadow and the scarletwinged
Cicala in the noonday leapeth not
Along the water-rounded granite-rock
The purple flower droops the golden bee
Is lilycradled I alone awake
My eyes are full of tears my heart of love
My heart is breaking and my eyes are dim
And I am all aweary of my life
O mother Ida manyfountained Ida
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
Hear me O Earth hear me O Hills O Caves
That house the cold crowned snake O mountain brooks
I am the daughter of a River-God
Hear me for I will speak and build up all
My sorrow with my song as yonder walls
Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed
A cloud that gathered shape for it may be
That while I speak of it a little while
My heart may wander from its deeper woe
O mother Ida manyfountained Ida
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
Aloft the mountain lawn was dewydark
And dewydark aloft the mountain pine
Beautiful Paris evil-hearted Paris
Leading a jetblack goat whitehorned whitehooved
Came up from reedy Simois all alone
O mother Ida hearken ere I die
I sate alone the goldensandalled morn
Rosehued the scornful hills I sate alone
With downdropt eyes white-breasted like a star
Fronting the dawn he came a leopard skin
From his white shoulder drooped his sunny hair
Clustered about his temples like a God's
And his cheek brightened as the foambow brightens
When the wind blows the foam and I called out
'Welcome Apollo welcome home Apollo
Apollo my Apollo loved Apollo'
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
He mildly smiling in his milk-white palm
Close-held a golden apple lightningbright
With changeful flashes dropt with dew of Heaven
Ambrosially smelling From his lip
Curved crimson the full-flowing river of speech
Came down upon my heart 'My own Oenone
Beautifulbrowed Oenone mine own soul
Behold this fruit whose gleaming rind ingrav'n
For the most fair in aftertime may breed
Deep evilwilledness of heaven and sore
Heartburning toward hallowed Ilion
And all the colour of my afterlife
Will be the shadow of to-day To-day
Here and Pallas and the floating grace
Of laughter-loving Aphrodite meet
In manyfolded Ida to receive
This meed of beauty she to whom my hand
Award the palm Within the green hillside
Under yon whispering tuft of oldest pine
Is an ingoing grotto strown with spar
And ivymatted at the mouth wherein
Thou unbeholden may'st behold unheard
Hear all and see thy Paris judge of Gods
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
It was the deep midnoon one silvery cloud
Had lost his way between the piney hills
They came all three the Olympian goddesses
Naked they came to the smoothswarded bower
Lustrous with lilyflower violeteyed
Both white and blue with lotetree-fruit thickset
Shadowed with singing-pine and all the while
Above the overwandering ivy and vine
This way and that in many a wild festoon
Ran riot garlanding the gnarled boughs
With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'
On the treetops a golden glorious cloud
Leaned slowly dropping down ambrosial dew
How beautiful they were too beautiful
To look upon but Paris was to me
More lovelier than all the world beside
O mother Ida hearken ere I die
First spake the imperial Olympian
With arched eyebrow smiling sovranly
Fulleyed here She to Paris made
Proffer of royal power ample rule
Unquestioned overflowing revenue
Wherewith to embellish state 'from many a vale
And river-sundered champaign clothed with corn
Or upland glebe wealthy in oil and wine 
Honour and homage tribute tax and toll
From many an inland town and haven large
Mast-thronged below her shadowing citadel
In glassy bays among her tallest towers
O mother Ida hearken ere I die
Still she spake on and still she spake of power
'Which in all action is the end of all
Power fitted to the season measured by
The height of the general feeling wisdomborn
And throned of wisdom from all neighbour crowns
Alliance and allegiance evermore Such boon from me
Heaven Queen to thee kingborn
A shepherd all thy life and yet kingborn
Should come most welcome seeing men in this
Only are likest gods who have attained
Rest in a happy place and quiet seats
Above the thunder with undying bliss
In knowledge of their own supremacy
The changeless calm of undisputed right
The highest height and topmost strength of power
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
She ceased and Paris held the costly fruit
Out at arm length so much the thought of power
Flattered his heart but Pallas where she stood
Somewhat apart her clear and bared limbs
O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear
Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold
The while above her full and earnest eye
Over her snowcold breast and angry cheek
Kept watch waiting decision made reply
'Selfreverence selfknowledge selfcontrol
Are the three hinges of the gates of Life
That open into power everyway
Without horizon bound or shadow or cloud
Yet not for power power of herself
Will come uncalled-for but to live by law
Acting the law we live by without fear
And because right is right to follow right
Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
Not as men value gold because it tricks
And blazons outward Life with ornament
But rather as the miser for itself
Good for selfgood doth half destroy selfgood
The means and end like two coiled snakes infect
Each other bound in one with hateful love
So both into the fountain and the stream
A drop of poison falls Come hearken to me
And look upon me and consider me
So shall thou find me fairest so endurance
Like to an athlete arm shall still become
Sinewed with motion till thine active will
As the dark body of the Sun robed round
With his own ever-emanating lights
Be flooded o'er with her own effluences
And thereby grow to freedom' Here she ceased
And Paris pondered I cried out 'Oh Paris
Give it to Pallas' but he heard me not
Or hearing would not hear me woe is me
O mother Ida manyfountained Ida
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
Idalian Aphrodite oceanborn
Fresh as the foam newbathed in Paphian wells
With rosy slender fingers upward drew
From her warm brow and bosom her dark hair
Fragrant and thick and on her head upbound
In a purple band below her lucid neck
Shone ivorylike and from the ground her foot
Gleamed rosywhite and o'er her rounded form
Between the shadows of the vine-bunches
Floated the glowing sunlights as she moved
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes
The herald of her triumph drawing nigh
Half-whispered in his ear 'I promise thee
The fairest and most loving wife in Greece'
I only saw my Paris raise his arm
I only saw great Here angry eyes
As she withdrew into the golden cloud
And I was left alone within the bower
And from that time to this I am alone
And I shall be alone until I die
Yet mother Ida hearken ere I die
Fairest why fairest wife am I not fair

Filling greengulphed Ida all between

The panther roar came muffled while I sat
Low in the valley Never nevermore

Conjectures of the features of her child
Ere it is born I will not die alone
Dear mother Ida hearken ere I die
Hear me O earth I will not die alone
Courage he said and pointed toward the land
This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon
In the afternoon they came unto a land
In which it seemed always afternoon
All round the coast the languid air did swoon
Breathing like one that hath a weary dream
Full-faced above the valley stood the moon
And like a downward smoke the slender stream
A land of streams some like a downward smoke
Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn did go
And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke
Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below
They saw the gleaming river seaward flow
From the inner land far off three mountain-tops
Three silent pinnacles of aged snow
Stood sunset-flush'd and dew'd with showery drops
The charmed sunset linger'd low adown
In the red West thro' mountain clefts the dale
Was seen far inland and the yellow down
Border'd with palm and many a winding vale
And meadow set with slender galingale
A land where all things always seem'd the same
And round about the keel with faces pale
Dark faces pale against that rosy flame
Branches they bore of that enchanted stem
Laden with flower and fruit whereof they gave
To each but whoso did receive of them
And taste to him the gushing of the wave
Far far away did seem to mourn and rave
On alien shores and if his fellow spake
His voice was thin as voices from the grave
And deep-asleep he seem'd yet all awake
They sat them down upon the yellow sand
Between the sun and moon upon the shore
And sweet it was to dream of Father-land
Of child and wife and slave but evermore
Most weary seem'd the sea weary the oar
Weary the wandering fields of barren foam
Then some one said We will return no more
And all at once they sang Our island home
There is sweet music here that softer falls
Than petals from blown roses on the grass
Or night-dews on still waters between walls
Of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass
Music that gentlier on the spirit lies
So all day long the noise of battle roll'd
Among the mountains by the winter sea
Until King Arthur table man by man
Had fall'n in Lyonness about their Lord
King Arthur then because his wound was deep
The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him
Sir Bedivere the last of all his knights
And bore him to a chapel nigh the field
A broken chancel with a broken cross
That stood on a dark strait of barren land
On one side lay the Ocean and on one
Lay a great water and the moon was full
Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere
The sequel of to-day unsolders all
The goodliest fellowship of famous knights
Whereof this world holds record Such a sleep
They sleep the men I loved I think that we
Shall never more at any future time
Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds
Walking about the gardens and the halls
Of Camelot as in the days that were
I perish by this people which I made 
Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again
To rule once more but let what will be be
I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm
That without help I cannot last till morn
Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur
Which was my pride for thou rememberest how
In those old days one summer noon an arm
Rose up from out the bosom of the lake
Clothed in white samite mystic wonderful
Holding the sword and how I row'd across
And took it and have worn it like a king
And wheresoever I am sung or told
In aftertime this also shall be known
But now delay not take Excalibur
And fling him far into the middle mere
Watch what thou seest and lightly bring me word
To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere
It is not meet Sir King to leave thee thus
Aidless alone and smitten thro' the helm
A little thing may harm a wounded man
Yet I thy hest will all perform at full
Watch what I see and lightly bring thee word
So saying from the ruin'd shrine he stept
And in the moon athwart the place of tombs
Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men
Old knights and over them the sea-wind sang
Shrill chill with flakes of foam He stepping down
By zig-zag paths and juts of pointed rock
Came on the shining levels of the lake
There drew he forth the brand Excalibur
And o'er him drawing it the winter moon
Brightening the skirts of a long cloud ran forth
And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt
For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks
Myriads of topaz-lights and jacinth-work
Of subtlest jewellery He gazed so long
That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood
This way and that dividing the swift mind
In act to throw but at the last it seem'd
Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd
There in the many-knotted waterflags
That whistled stiff and dry about the marge
So strode he back slow to the wounded king
Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere
Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave
What is it thou hast seen or what hast heard
And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere
I heard the ripple washing in the reeds
And the wild water lapping on the crag
To whom replied King Arthur faint and pale
Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name
Not rendering true answer as beseem'd
Thy fealty nor like a noble knight
For surer sign had follow'd either hand
Or voice or else a motion of the mere
This is a shameful thing for men to lie
Yet now I charge thee quickly go again
As thou art lief and dear and do the thing
I bade thee watch and lightly bring me word
Then went Sir Bedivere the second time
Across the ridge and paced beside the mere
Counting the dewy pebbles fix'd in thought
But when he saw the wonder of the hilt
How curiously and strangely chased he smote
His palms together and he cried aloud
And if indeed I cast the brand away
Surely a precious thing one worthy note
Should thus be lost for ever from the earth
Which might have pleased the eyes of many men
What good should follow this if this were done
What harm undone deep harm to disobey
Seeing obedience is the bond of rule
Were it well to obey then if a king demand
An act unprofitable against himself
The king is sick and knows not what he does
What record or what relic of my lord
Should be to aftertime but empty breath
And rumours of a doubt but were this kept
Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings
Some one might show it at a joust of arms
Saying 'King Arthur sword Excalibur
Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake
Nine years she wrought it sitting in the deeps
Upon the hidden bases of the hills
So might some old man speak in the aftertime
To all the people winning reverence
But now much honour and much fame were lost
So spake he clouded with his own conceit
And hid Excalibur the second time
And so strode back slow to the wounded King
Then spoke King Arthur breathing heavily
What is it thou hast seen or what hast heard
And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere
I heard the water lapping on the crag
And the long ripple washing in the reeds
To whom replied King Arthur much in wrath
Ah miserable and unkind untrue
Unknightly traitor-hearted Woe is me
Authority forgets a dying king
Laid widow'd of the power in his eye
That bow'd the will I see thee what thou art
For thou the latest-left of all my knights
In whom should meet the offices of all
Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt
Either from lust of gold or like a girl
Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes
Yet for a man may fail in duty twice
And the third time may prosper get thee hence
But if thou spare to fling Excalibur
I will arise and slay thee with my hands
Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere and ran
And leaping down the ridges lightly plunged
Among the bulrush-beds and clutch'd the sword
And strongly wheel'd and threw it The great brand
Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon
And flashing round and round and whirl'd in an arch
Shot like a streamer of the northern morn
Seen where the moving isles of winter shock
By night with noises of the northern sea
So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur
But ere he dipt the surface rose an arm
Clothed in white samite mystic wonderful
And caught him by the hilt and brandish'd him
Three times and drew him under in the mere
And lightly went the other to the King
Then spoke King Arthur drawing thicker breath
'Now see I by thine eyes that this is done
Speak out what is it thou hast heard or seen
And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere
Sir King I closed mine eyelids lest the gems
Should blind my purpose for I never saw
Nor shall see here or elsewhere till I die
Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men
So great a miracle as yonder hilt
Then with both hands I flung him wheeling him
But when I look'd again behold an arm
Clothed in white samite mystic wonderful
That caught him by the hilt and brandish'd him
Three times and drew him under in the mere
And answer made King Arthur breathing hard
My end draws nigh 'tis time that I were gone
Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight
And bear me to the margin yet I fear
My wound hath taken cold and I shall die
So saying from the pavement he hath rose
Slowly with pain reclining on his arm
And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
As in a picture Him Sir Bedivere
Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears
And would have spoken but he found not words
Then took with care and kneeling on one knee
O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands
And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs
But as he walk'd King Arthur panted hard
Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
When all the house is mute So sigh'd the King
Muttering and murmuring at his ear
Quick quick I fear it is too late and I shall die
But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge
Clothed with his breath and looking as he walk'd
Larger than human on the frozen hills
He heard the deep behind him and a cry
Before His own thought drove him like a goad
Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves
And barren chasms and all to left and right
The bare black cliff clang'd round him as he based
His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang
Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels 
And on a sudden lo the level lake
And the long glories of the winter moon
Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge
Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern
Beneath them and descending they were ware
That all the decks were dense with stately forms
Black-stoled black-hooded like a dream by these
Three Queens with crowns of gold and from them rose
A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars
And as it were one voice an agony
Of lamentation like a wind that shrills
All night in a waste land where no one comes
Or hath come since the making of the world
Then murmur'd Arthur Place me in the barge
And to the barge they came There those three Queens
Put forth their hands and took the King and wept
But she that rose the tallest of them all
And fairest laid his head upon her lap
And loosed the shatter'd casque and chafed his hands
And call'd him by his name complaining loud
And dropping bitter tears against his brow
Striped with dark blood for all his face was white
And colourless and like the wither'd moon
Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east
And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops
Of onset and the light and lustrous curls 
That made his forehead like a rising sun
High from the dais-throne were parch'd with dust
Or clotted into points and hanging loose
Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips
So like a shatter'd column lay the King
Not like that Arthur who with lance in rest
From spur to plume a star of tournament
Shot thro' the lists at Camelot and charged
Before the eyes of ladies and of kings
Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere
Ah my Lord Arthur whither shall I go
Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes
For now I see the true old times are dead
When every morning brought a noble chance
And every chance brought out a noble knight
Such times have been not since the light that led
The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh
But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved
Which was an image of the mighty world
And I the last go forth companionless
And the days darken round me and the years
Among new men strange faces other minds
And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge
The old order changeth yielding place to new
And God fulfils Himself in many ways
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world
Comfort thyself what comfort is in me
I have lived my life and that which I have done
May He within Himself make pure but thou
If thou shouldst never see my face again
Pray for my soul More things are wrought by prayer
Than this world dreams of Wherefore let thy voice
Rise like a fountain for me night and day
For what are men better than sheep or goats
That nourish a blind life within the brain
If knowing God they lift not hands of prayer
Both for themselves and those who call them friend
For so the whole round earth is every way
Bound by gold chains about the feet of God
But now farewell I am going a long way
With these thou seest if indeed I go 
For all my mind is clouded with a doubt
To the island-valley of Avilion
Where falls not hail or rain or any snow
Nor ever wind blows loudly but it lies
Deep-meadow'd happy fair with orchard-lawns
And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea
Where I will heal me of my grievous wound
So said he and the barge with oar and sail
Moved from the brink like some full-breasted swan
That fluting a wild carol ere her death
Ruffles her pure cold plume and takes the flood
With swarthy webs Long stood Sir Bedivere
Revolving many memories till the hull
Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn
And on the mere the wailing died away
Here ended Hall and our last light that long
Had wink'd and threaten'd darkness flared and fell
At which the Parson sent to sleep with sound
And waked with silence grunted Good but we
Sat rapt It was the tone with which he read 
Perhaps some modern touches here and there
Redeem'd it from the charge of nothingness 
Or else we loved the man and prized his work
I know not but we sitting as I said
The cock crew loud as at that time of year
The lusty bird takes every hour for dawn
Then Francis muttering like a man ill-used
There now that nothing drew a little back
And drove his heel into the smoulder'd log
That sent a blast of sparkles up the flue
And so to bed where yet in sleep I seem'd
To sail with Arthur under looming shores
Point after point till on to dawn when dreams
Begin to feel the truth and stir of day
To me methought who waited with a crowd
There came a bark that blowing forward bore
King Arthur like a modern gentleman
Of stateliest port and all the people cried
Arthur is come again he cannot die
Then those that stood upon the hills behind
Repeated Come again and thrice as fair
And further inland voices echoed 
Come With all good things and war shall be no more
At this a hundred bells began to peal
That with the sound I woke and heard indeed
The clear church-bells ring in the Christmas morn
This morning is the morning of the day
When I and Eustace from the city went
To see the Gardener Daughter I and he
Brothers in Art a friendship so complete
Portion'd in halves between us that we grew
The fable of the city where we dwelt
My Eustace might have sat for Hercules
So muscular he spread so broad of breast
He by some law that holds in love and draws
The greater to the lesser long desired
A certain miracle of symmetry
A miniature of loveliness all grace
Summ'd up and closed in little Juliet she
So light of foot so light of spirit oh she
To me myself for some three careless moons
The summer pilot of an empty heart
Unto the shores of nothing Know you not
Such touches are but embassies of love
To tamper with the feelings ere he found
Empire for life but Eustace painted her
And said to me she sitting with us then
When will you paint like this and I replied
My words were half in earnest half in jest
'Tis not your work but Love Love unperceived
A more ideal Artist he than all
Came drew your pencil from you made those eyes
Darker than darkest pansies and that hair
More black than ashbuds in the front of March
And Juliet answer'd laughing Go and see
The Gardener daughter trust me after that
You scarce can fail to match his masterpiece
And up we rose and on the spur we went
Not wholly in the busy world nor quite
Beyond it blooms the garden that I love
News from the humming city comes to it
In sound of funeral or of marriage bells
And sitting muffled in dark leaves you hear
The windy clanging of the minster clock
Although between it and the garden lies
A league of grass wash'd by a slow broad stream
That stirr'd with languid pulses of the oar
Waves all its lazy lilies and creeps on
Barge-laden to three arches of a bridge
Crown'd with the minster-towers The fields between
Are dewy-fresh browsed by deep-udder'd kine
And all about the large lime feathers low
The lime a summer home of murmurous wings
In that still place she hoarded in herself
Grew seldom seen not less among us lived
Her fame from lip to lip Who had not heard
Of Rose the Gardener daughter Where was he
So blunt in memory so old at heart
At such a distance from his youth in grief
That having seen forgot The common mouth
So gross to express delight in praise of her
Grew oratory Such a lord is Love
And Beauty such a mistress of the world
And if I said that Fancy led by Love
Would play with flying forms and images
Yet this is also true that long before
I look'd upon her when I heard her name
My heart was like a prophet to my heart
And told me I should love A crowd of hopes
That sought to sow themselves like winged seeds
Born out of everything I heard and saw
Flutter'd about my senses and my soul
And vague desires like fitful blasts of balm
To one that travels quickly made the air
Of Life delicious and all kinds of thought
That verged upon them sweeter than the dream
Dream'd by a happy man when the dark East
Unseen is brightening to his bridal morn
And sure this orbit of the memory folds
For ever in itself the day we went
To see her All the land in flowery squares
Beneath a broad and equal-blowing wind
Smelt of the coming summer as one large cloud
Drew downward but all else of heaven was pure
Up to the Sun and May from verge to verge
And May with me from head to heel And now
As tho' 'twere yesterday as tho' it were
The hour just flown that morn with all its sound
For those old Mays had thrice the life of these
Rings in mine ears The steer forgot to graze
And where the hedge-row cuts the pathway stood
Leaning his horns into the neighbour field
And lowing to his fellows From the woods
Came voices of the well-contented doves
The lark could scarce get out his notes for joy
But shook his song together as he near'd
His happy home the ground To left and right
The cuckoo told his name to all the hills
The mellow ouzel fluted in the elm
The redcap whistled and the nightingale
Sang loud as tho' he were the bird of day
And Eustace turn'd and smiling said to me
Hear how the bushes echo by my life
These birds have joyful thoughts Think you they sing
Like poets from the vanity of song
Or have they any sense of why they sing
And would they praise the heavens for what they have
And I made answer Were there nothing else
For which to praise the heavens but only love
That only love were cause enough for praise
Lightly he laugh'd as one that read my thought
And on we went but ere an hour had pass'd
We reach'd a meadow slanting to the North
Down which a well-worn pathway courted us
To one green wicket in a privet hedge
This yielding gave into a grassy walk
Thro' crowded lilac-ambush trimly pruned
And one warm gust full-fed with perfume blew
Beyond us as we enter'd in the cool
The garden stretches southward In the midst
A cedar spread his dark-green layers of shade
The garden-glasses shone and momently
The twinkling laurel scatter'd silver lights
Eustace I said This wonder keeps the house
He nodded but a moment afterwards
He cried Look look Before he ceased I turn'd
And ere a star can wink beheld her there
For up the porch there grew an Eastern rose
That flowering high the last night gale had caught
And blown across the walk One arm aloft 
Gown'd in pure white that fitted to the shape 
Holding the bush to fix it back she stood
A single stream of all her soft brown hair
Pour'd on one side the shadow of the flowers
Stole all the golden gloss and wavering
Lovingly lower trembled on her waist 
Ah happy shade and still went wavering down
But ere it touch'd a foot that might have danced
The greensward into greener circles dipt
And mix'd with shadows of the common ground
But the full day dwelt on her brows and sunn'd
Her violet eyes and all her Hebe-bloom
And doubled his own warmth against her lips
And on the bounteous wave of such a breast
As never pencil drew Half light half shade
She stood a sight to make an old man young
So rapt we near'd the house but she a Rose
In roses mingled with her fragrant toil
Nor heard us come nor from her tendance turn'd
Into the world without till close at hand
And almost ere I knew mine own intent
This murmur broke the stillness of that air
Which brooded round about her Ah one rose
One rose but one by those fair fingers cull'd
Were worth a hundred kisses press'd on lips
Less exquisite than thine She look'd but all
Suffused with blushes neither self-possess'd
Nor startled but betwixt this mood and that
Divided in a graceful quiet paused
And dropt the branch she held and turning wound
Her looser hair in braid and stirr'd her lips
For some sweet answer tho' no answer came
Nor yet refused the rose but granted it
And moved away and left me statue-like
In act to render thanks I that whole day
Saw her no more altho' I linger'd there
Till every daisy slept and Love white star
Beam'd thro' the thicken'd cedar in the dusk
So home we went and all the livelong way
With solemn gibe did Eustace banter me
Now said he will you climb the top of Art
You cannot fail but work in hues to dim
The Titianic Flora Will you match
My Juliet you not you the Master
Love A more ideal Artist he than all
So home I went but could not sleep for joy
Reading her perfect features in the gloom
Kissing the rose she gave me o'er and o'er
And shaping faithful record of the glance
That graced the giving such a noise of life
Swarm'd in the golden present such a voice
Call'd to me from the years to come and such
A length of bright horizon rimm'd the dark
And all that night I heard the watchmen peal
The sliding season all that night I heard
The heavy clocks knolling the drowsy hours
The drowsy hours dispensers of all good
O'er the mute city stole with folded wings
Distilling odours on me as they went
To greet their fairer sisters of the East
Love at first sight first-born and heir to all
Made this night thus Henceforward squall nor storm
Could keep me from that Eden where she dwelt
Light pretexts drew me sometimes a
Dutch love For tulips then for roses moss or musk
To grace my city-rooms or fruits and cream
Served in the weeping elm and more and more
A word could bring the colour to my cheek
A thought would fill my eyes with happy dew
Love trebled life within me and with each
The year increased The daughters of the year
One after one thro' that still garden pass'd
Each garlanded with her peculiar flower
Danced into light and died into the shade
And each in passing touch'd with some new grace
Or seem'd to touch her so that day by day
Like one that never can be wholly known
Her beauty grew till Autumn brought an hour
For Eustace when I heard his deep I will
Breathed like the covenant of a God to hold
From thence thro' all the worlds but I rose up
Full of his bliss and following her dark eyes
Felt earth as air beneath me till I reach'd
The wicket-gate and found her standing there
There sat we down upon a garden mound
Two mutually enfolded Love the third
Between us in the circle of his arms
Enwound us both and over many a range
Of waning lime the gray cathedral towers
Across a hazy glimmer of the west
Reveal'd their shining windows from them clash'd
The bells we listen'd with the time we play'd
We spoke of other things we coursed about
The subject most at heart more near and near
Like doves about a dovecote wheeling round
The central wish until we settled there
Then in that time and place I spoke to her
Requiring tho' I knew it was mine own
Yet for the pleasure that I took to hear
Requiring at her hand the greatest gift
A woman heart the heart of her I loved
And in that time and place she answer'd me
And in the compass of three little words
More musical than ever came in one
The silver fragments of a broken voice
Made me most happy faltering I am thine
Shall I cease here Is this enough to say
That my desire like all strongest hopes
By its own energy fulfilled itself
Merged in completion Would you learn at full
How passion rose thro' circumstantial grades
Beyond all grades develop'd and indeed
I had not staid so long to tell you all
But while I mused came Memory with sad eyes
Holding the folded annals of my youth
And while I mused Love with knit brows went by
And with a flying finger swept my lips
And spake Be wise not easily forgiven
Are those who setting wide the doors that bar
The secret bridal chambers of the heart
Let in the day Here then my words have end
Yet might I tell of meetings of farewells 
Of that which came between more sweet than each
In whispers like the whispers of the leaves
That tremble round a nightingale in sighs
Which perfect Joy perplex'd for utterance
Stole from her sister Sorrow Might I not tell
Of difference reconcilement pledges given
And vows where there was never need of vows
And kisses where the heart on one wild leap
Hung tranced from all pulsation as above
The heavens between their fairy fleeces pale
Sow'd all their mystic gulfs with fleeting stars
Or while the balmy glooming crescent-lit
Spread the light haze along the river-shores
And in the hollows or as once we met
Unheedful tho' beneath a whispering rain
Night slid down one long stream of sighing wind
And in her bosom bore the baby Sleep
But this whole hour your eyes have been intent
On that veil'd picture veil'd for what it holds
May not be dwelt on by the common day
This prelude has prepared thee Raise thy soul
Make thine heart ready with thine eyes the time
Is come to raise the veil Behold her there
As I beheld her ere she knew my heart
My first last love the idol of my youth
The darling of my manhood and alas
Now the most blessed memory of mine age
The Bull the Fleece are cramm'd and not a room
For love or money Let us picnic there
At Audley Court I spoke while Audley feast
Humm'd like a hive all round the narrow quay
To Francis with a basket on his arm
To Francis just alighted from the boat
And breathing of the sea With all my heart
Said Francis Then we shoulder'd thro' the swarm
And rounded by the stillness of the beach
To where the bay runs up its latest horn
We left the dying ebb that faintly lipp'd
The flat red granite so by many a sweep
Of meadow smooth from aftermath we reach'd
The griffin-guarded gates and pass'd thro' all
The pillar'd dusk of sounding sycamores
And cross'd the garden to the gardener lodge
With all its casements bedded and its walls
And chimneys muffled in the leafy vine
There on a slope of orchard Francis laid
A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound
Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home
And half-cut-down a pasty costly-made
Where quail and pigeon lark and leveret lay
Like fossils of the rock with golden yolks
Imbedded and injellied last with these
A flask of cider from his father vats
Prime which I knew and so we sat and eat
And talk'd old matters over who was dead
Who married who was like to be and how
The races went and who would rent the hall
Then touch'd upon the game how scarce it was
This season glancing thence discuss'd the farm
The fourfield system and the price of grain
And struck upon the corn-laws where we split
And came again together on the king
With heated faces till he laugh'd aloud
And while the blackbird on the pippin hung
To hear him clapt his hand in mine and sang 
Oh who would fight and march and counter-march
Be shot for sixpence in a battle-field
And shovell'd up into a bloody trench
Where no one knows but let me live my life
Oh who would cast and balance at a desk
Perch'd like a crow upon a three-legg'd stool
Till all his juice is dried and all his joints
Are full of chalk but let me live my life
Who'd serve the state for if I carved my name
Upon the cliffs that guard my native land
I might as well have traced it in the sands
The sea wastes all but let me live my life
Oh who would love I wooed a woman once
But she was sharper than an eastern wind
And all my heart turn'd from her as a thorn
Turns from the sea but let me live my life
He sang his song and I replied with mine
I found it in a volume all of songs
Knock'd down to me when old Sir Robert pride
His books the more the pity so I said 
Came to the hammer here in March and this 
I set the words and added names I knew
Sleep Ellen Aubrey sleep and dream of me
Sleep Ellen folded in thy sister arm
And sleeping haply dream her arm is mine
Sleep Ellen folded in Emilia arm
Emilia fairer than all else but thou
For thou art fairer than all else that is
Sleep breathing health and peace upon her breast
Sleep breathing love and trust against her lip
I go to-night I come to-morrow morn
I go but I return I would I were
The pilot of the darkness and the dream
Sleep Ellen Aubrey love and dream of me
So sang we each to either Francis Hale
The farmer son who lived across the bay
My friend and I that having wherewithal
And in the fallow leisure of my life
A rolling stone of here and everywhere
Did what I would but ere the night we rose
And saunter'd home beneath a moon that just
In crescent dimly rain'd about the leaf
Twilights of airy silver till we reach'd
The limit of the hills and as we sank
From rock to rock upon the gloomy quay
The town was hush'd beneath us lower down
The bay was oily-calm the harbour buoy
With one green sparkle ever and anon
Dipt by itself and we were glad at heart
NOT that I love thy children whose dull eyes
See nothing save their own unlovely woe
Whose minds know nothing nothing care to know 
But that the roar of thy Democracies
Thy reigns of Terror thy great Anarchies
Mirror my wildest passions like the sea
And give my rage a brother  Liberty
For this sake only do thy dissonant cries
Delight my discreet soul else might all kings
By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades
Rob nations of their rights inviolate
And I remain unmoved and yet and yet
These Christs that die upon the barricades
God knows it I am with them in some things
CHRIST dost Thou live indeed or are Thy bones
Still straitened in their rock-hewn sepulchre
And was Thy Rising only dreamed by her
Whose love of Thee for all her sin atones
For here the air is horrid with men groans
The priests who call upon Thy name are slain
Dost Thou not hear the bitter wail of pain
From those whose children lie upon the stones
Come down O Son of God incestuous gloom
Curtains the land and through the starless night
Over Thy Cross a Crescent moon I see
If Thou in very truth didst burst the tomb
Come down O Son of Man and show Thy might
Lest Mahomet be crowned instead of Thee
THERE was a time in Europe long ago
When no man died for freedom anywhere
But England lion leaping from its lair
Laid hands on the oppressor it was so
While England could a great Republic show
Witness the men of Piedmont chiefest care
Of Cromwell when with impotent despair
The Pontiff in his painted portico
Trembled before our stern ambassadors
How comes it then that from such high estate
We have thus fallen save that Luxury
With barren merchandise piles up the gate
Where noble thoughts and deeds should enter by
Else might we still be Milton heritors
THIS mighty empire hath but feet of clay
Of all its ancient chivalry and might
Our little island is forsaken quite
Some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay
And from its hills that voice hath passed away
Which spake of Freedom O come out of it
Come out of it my Soul thou art not fit
For this vile traffic-house where day by day
Wisdom and reverence are sold at mart
And the rude people rage with ignorant cries
Against an heritage of centuries
It mars my calm wherefore in dreams of Art
And loftiest culture I would stand apart
Neither for God nor for his enemies
I REACHED the Alps the soul within me burned
Italia my Italia at thy name
And when from out the mountain heart I came
And saw the land for which my life had yearned
I laughed as one who some great prize had earned
And musing on the marvel of thy fame
I watched the day till marked with wounds of flame
The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned
The pine-trees waved as waves a woman hair
And in the orchards every twining spray
Was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam
But when I knew that far away at Rome
In evil bonds a second Peter lay
I wept to see the land so very fair
WAS this His coming I had hoped to see
A scene of wondrous glory as was told
Of some great God who in a rain of gold
Broke open bars and fell on Danae
Or a dread vision as when Semele
Sickening for love and unappeased desire
Prayed to see God clear body and the fire
Caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly
With such glad dreams I sought this holy place
And now with wondering eyes and heart I stand
Before this supreme mystery of Love
Some kneeling girl with passionless pale face
An angel with a lily in his hand
And over both the white wings of a Dove
NAY Lord not thus white lilies in the spring
Sad olive-groves or silver-breasted dove
Teach me more clearly of Thy life and love
Than terrors of red flame and thundering
The hillside vines dear memories of Thee bring
A bird at evening flying to its nest
Tells me of One who had no place of rest
I think it is of Thee the sparrows sing
Come rather on some autumn afternoon
When red and brown are burnished on the leaves
And the fields echo to the gleaner song
Come when the splendid fulness of the moon
Looks down upon the rows of golden sheaves
And reap Thy harvest we have waited long
THE silver trumpets rang across the Dome
The people knelt upon the ground with awe
And borne upon the necks of men I saw
Like some great God the Holy Lord of Rome
Priest-like he wore a robe more white than foam
And king-like swathed himself in royal red
Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head
In splendour and in light the Pope passed home
My heart stole back across wide wastes of years
To One who wandered by a lonely sea
And sought in vain for any place of rest
'Foxes have holes and every bird its nest
I only I must wander wearily
And bruise my feet and drink wine salt with tears
COME down O Christ and help me reach Thy hand
For I am drowning in a stormier sea
Than Simon on Thy lake of Galilee
The wine of life is spilt upon the sand
My heart is as some famine-murdered land
Whence all good things have perished utterly
And well I know my soul in Hell must lie
If I this night before God throne should stand
'He sleeps perchance or rideth to the chase
Like Baal when his prophets howled that name
From morn to noon on Carmel smitten height
Nay peace I shall behold before the night
The feet of brass the robe more white than flame
The wounded hands the weary human face
I STOOD by the unvintageable sea
Till the wet waves drenched face and hair with spray
The long red fires of the dying day
Burned in the west the wind piped drearily
And to the land the clamorous gulls did flee
'Alas' I cried 'my life is full of pain
And who can garner fruit or golden grain
From these waste fields which travail ceaselessly
My nets gaped wide with many a break and flaw
Nathless I threw them as my final cast
Into the sea and waited for the end
When lo a sudden glory and I saw
From the black waters of my tortured past
The argent splendour of white limbs ascend
A LILY-GIRL not made for this world pain
With brown soft hair close braided by her ears
And longing eyes half veiled by slumberous tears
Like bluest water seen through mists of rain
Pale cheeks whereon no love hath left its stain
Red underlip drawn in for fear of love
And white throat whiter than the silvered dove
Through whose wan marble creeps one purple vein
Yet though my lips shall praise her without cease
Even to kiss her feet I am not bold
Being o'ershadowed by the wings of awe
Like Dante when he stood with Beatrice
Beneath the flaming Lion breast and saw
The seventh Crystal and the Stair of Gold
WHERE hast thou been since round the walls of Troy
The sons of God fought in that great emprise
Why dost thou walk our common earth again
Hast thou forgotten that impassioned boy
His purple galley and his Tyrian men
And treacherous Aphrodite mocking eyes
For surely it was thou who like a star
Hung in the silver silence of the night
Didst lure the Old World chivalry and might
Into the clamorous crimson waves of war
Or didst thou rule the fire-laden moon
In amorous Sidon was thy temple built
Over the light and laughter of the sea
Where behind lattice scarlet-wrought and gilt
Some brown-limbed girl did weave thee tapestry
All through the waste and wearied hours of noon
Till her wan cheek with flame of passion burned
And she rose up the sea-washed lips to kiss
Of some glad Cyprian sailor safe returned
From Calpe and the cliffs of Herakles
No thou art Helen and none other one
It was for thee that young Sarpedon died
And Memnon manhood was untimely spent
It was for thee gold-crested Hector tried
With Thetis' child that evil race to run
In the last year of thy beleaguerment
Ay even now the glory of thy fame
Burns in those fields of trampled asphodel
Where the high lords whom Ilion knew so well
Clash ghostly shields and call upon thy name
Where hast thou been in that enchanted land
Whose slumbering vales forlorn Calypso knew
Where never mower rose at break of day
But all unswathed the trammelling grasses grew
And the sad shepherd saw the tall corn stand
Till summer red had changed to withered grey
Didst thou lie there by some Lethaean stream
Deep brooding on thine ancient memory
The crash of broken spears the fiery gleam
From shivered helm the Grecian battle-cry
Nay thou wert hidden in that hollow hill
With one who is forgotten utterly
That discrowned Queen men call the Erycine
Hidden away that never mightst thou see
The face of Her before whose mouldering shrine
To-day at Rome the silent nations kneel
Who gat from Love no joyous gladdening
But only Love intolerable pain
Only a sword to pierce her heart in twain
Only the bitterness of child-bearing
The lotus-leaves which heal the wounds of Death
Lie in thy hand O be thou kind to me
While yet I know the summer of my days
For hardly can my tremulous lips draw breath
To fill the silver trumpet with thy praise
So bowed am I before thy mystery
So bowed and broken on Love terrible wheel
That I have lost all hope and heart to sing
Yet care I not what ruin time may bring
If in thy temple thou wilt let me kneel
Alas alas thou wilt not tarry here
But like that bird the servant of the sun
Who flies before the north wind and the night
So wilt thou fly our evil land and drear
Back to the tower of thine old delight
And the red lips of young Euphorion
Nor shall I ever see thy face again
But in this poisonous garden-close must stay
Crowning my brows with the thorn-crown of pain
Till all my loveless life shall pass away
O Helen Helen Helen yet a while
Yet for a little while O tarry here
Till the dawn cometh and the shadows flee
For in the gladsome sunlight of thy smile
Of heaven or hell I have no thought or fear
Seeing I know no other god but thee
No other god save him before whose feet
In nets of gold the tired planets move
The incarnate spirit of spiritual love
Who in thy body holds his joyous seat
Thou wert not born as common women are
But girt with silver splendour of the foam
Didst from the depths of sapphire seas arise
And at thy coming some immortal star
Bearded with flame blazed in the Eastern skies
And waked the shepherds on thine island-home
Thou shalt not die no asps of Egypt creep
Close at thy heels to taint the delicate air
No sullen-blooming poppies stain thy hair
Those scarlet heralds of eternal sleep
Lily of love pure and inviolate
Tower of ivory red rose of fire
Thou hast come down our darkness to illume
For we close-caught in the wide nets of Fate
Wearied with waiting for the World Desire
Aimlessly wandered in the House of gloom
Aimlessly sought some slumberous anodyne
For wasted lives for lingering wretchedness
Till we beheld thy re-arisen shrine
And the white glory of thy loveliness
TO that gaunt House of Art which lacks for naught
Of all the great things men have saved from Time
The withered body of a girl was brought
Dead ere the world glad youth had touched its prime
And seen by lonely Arabs lying hid
In the dim womb of some black pyramid
But when they had unloosed the linen band
Which swathed the Egyptian body lo was found
Closed in the wasted hollow of her hand
A little seed which sown in English ground
Did wondrous snow of starry blossoms bear
And spread rich odours through our spring-tide air
With such strange arts this flower did allure
That all forgotten was the asphodel
And the brown bee the lily paramour
Forsook the cup where he was wont to dwell
For not a thing of earth it seemed to be
But stolen from some heavenly Arcady
In vain the sad narcissus wan and white
At its own beauty hung across the stream
The purple dragon-fly had no delight
With its gold dust to make his wings a-gleam
Ah no delight the jasmine-bloom to kiss
Or brush the rain-pearls from the eucharis
For love of it the passionate nightingale
Forgot the hills of Thrace the cruel king
And the pale dove no longer cared to sail
Through the wet woods at time of blossoming
But round this flower of Egypt sought to float
With silvered wing and amethystine throat
While the hot sun blazed in his tower of blue
A cooling wind crept from the land of snows
And the warm south with tender tears of dew
Drenched its white leaves when Hesperos up-rose
Amid those sea-green meadows of the sky
On which the scarlet bars of sunset lie
But when o'er wastes of lily-haunted field
The tired birds had stayed their amorous tune
And broad and glittering like an argent shield
High in the sapphire heavens hung the moon
Did no strange dream or evil memory make
Each tremulous petal of its blossoms shake
Ah no to this bright flower a thousand years
Seemed but the lingering of a summer day
It never knew the tide of cankering fears
Which turn a boy gold hair to withered grey
The dread desire of death it never knew
Or how all folk that they were born must rue
For we to death with pipe and dancing go
Nor would we pass the ivory gate again
As some sad river wearied of its flow
Through the dull plains the haunts of common men
Leaps lover-like into the terrible sea
And counts it gain to die so gloriously
We mar our lordly strength in barren strife
With the world legions led by clamorous care
It never feels decay but gathers life
From the pure sunlight and the supreme air
We live beneath Time wasting sovereignty
It is the child of all eternity
IT is full winter now the trees are bare
Save where the cattle huddle from the cold
Beneath the pine for it doth never wear
The autumn gaudy livery whose gold
Her jealous brother pilfers but is true
From Saturn cave a few thin wisps of hay
Lie on the sharp black hedges where the wain
Dragged the sweet pillage of a summer day
From the low meadows up the narrow lane
Upon the half-thawed snow the bleating sheep
From the shut stable to the frozen stream
And back again disconsolate and miss
The bawling shepherds and the noisy team
And overhead in circling listlessness
The cawing rooks whirl round the frosted stack
Where the gaunt bittern stalks among the reeds
And flaps his wings and stretches back his neck
And hoots to see the moon across the meads
Limps the poor frightened hare a little speck
And a stray seamew with its fretful cry
Full winter and the lusty goodman brings
His load of faggots from the chilly byre
And stamps his feet upon the hearth and flings
The sappy billets on the waning fire
And laughs to see the sudden lightening scare
Already the slim crocus stirs the snow
And soon yon blanched fields will bloom again
With nodding cowslips for some lad to mow
For with the first warm kisses of the rain
The winter icy sorrow breaks to tears
From the dark warren where the fir-cones lie
And treads one snowdrop under foot and runs
Over the mossy knoll and blackbirds fly
Across our path at evening and the suns
Stay longer with us ah how good to see
Dance through the hedges till the early rose
That sweet repentance of the thorny briar
Burst from its sheathed emerald and disclose
The little quivering disk of golden fire
Which the bees know so well for with it come
Then up and down the field the sower goes
While close behind the laughing younker scares
With shrilly whoop the black and thievish crows
And then the chestnut-tree its glory wears
And on the grass the creamy blossom falls
Steal from the bluebells' nodding carillons
Each breezy morn and then white jessamine
That star of its own heaven snap-dragons
With lolling crimson tongues and eglantine
In dusty velvets clad usurp the bed
Red leaf by leaf its folded panoply
And pansies closed their purple-lidded eyes
Chrysanthemums from gilded argosy
Unload their gaudy scentless merchandise
And violets getting overbold withdraw
O happy field and O thrice happy tree
Soon will your queen in daisy-flowered smock
And crown of flower-de-luce trip down the lea
Soon will the lazy shepherds drive their flock
Back to the pasture by the pool and soon
Soon will the glade be bright with bellamour
The flower which wantons love and those sweet nuns
Vale-lilies in their snowy vestiture
Will tell their beaded pearls and carnations
With mitred dusky leaves will scent the wind
Dear bride of Nature and most bounteous spring
That canst give increase to the sweet-breath'd kine
And to the kid its little horns and bring
The soft and silky blossoms to the vine
Where is that old nepenthe which of yore
There was a time when any common bird
Could make me sing in unison a time
When all the strings of boyish life were stirred
To quick response or more melodious rhyme
By every forest idyll do I change
Nay nay thou art the same 'tis I who seek
To vex with sighs thy simple solitude
And because fruitless tears bedew my cheek
Would have thee weep with me in brotherhood
Fool shall each wronged and restless spirit dare
Thou art the same 'tis I whose wretched soul
Takes discontent to be its paramour
And gives its kingdom to the rude control
Of what should be its servitor for sure
Wisdom is somewhere though the stormy sea
To burn with one clear flame to stand erect
In natural honour not to bend the knee
In profitless prostrations whose effect
Is by itself condemned what alchemy
Can teach me this what herb Medea brewed
The minor chord which ends the harmony
And for its answering brother waits in vain
Sobbing for incompleted melody
Dies a swan death but I the heir of pain
A silent Memnon with blank lidless eyes
The quenched-out torch the lonely cypress-gloom
The little dust stored in the narrow urn
The gentle KhAIRE of the Attic tomb 
Were not these better far than to return
To my old fitful restless malady
Nay for perchance that poppy-crowned god
Is like the watcher by a sick man bed
Who talks of sleep but gives it not his rod
Hath lost its virtue and when all is said
Death is too rude too obvious a key
And Love that noble madness whose august
And inextinguishable might can slay
The soul with honeyed drugs alas I must
From such sweet ruin play the runaway
Although too constant memory never can
Which for a little season made my youth
So soft a swoon of exquisite indolence
That all the chiding of more prudent Truth
Seemed the thin voice of jealousy O hence
Thou huntress deadlier than Artemis
My lips have drunk enough no more no more 
Though Love himself should turn his gilded prow
Back to the troubled waters of this shore
Where I am wrecked and stranded even now
The chariot wheels of passion sweep too near
More barren ay those arms will never lean
Down through the trellised vines and draw my soul
In sweet reluctance through the tangled green
Some other head must wear that aureole
For I am hers who loves not any man
Let Venus go and chuck her dainty page
And kiss his mouth and toss his curly hair
With net and spear and hunting equipage
Let young Adonis to his tryst repair
But me her fond and subtle-fashioned spell
Ay though I were that laughing shepherd boy
Who from Mount Ida saw the little cloud
Pass over Tenedos and lofty Troy
And knew the coming of the Queen and bowed
In wonder at her feet not for the sake
Then rise supreme Athena argent-limbed
And if my lips be musicless inspire
At least my life was not thy glory hymned
By One who gave to thee his sword and lyre
Like AEschylos at well-fought Marathon
And yet I cannot tread the Portico
And live without desire fear and pain
Or nurture that wise calm which long ago
The grave Athenian master taught to men
Self-poised self-centred and self-comforted
Alas that serene brow those eloquent lips
Those eyes that mirrored all eternity
Rest in their own Colonos an eclipse
Hath come on Wisdom and Mnemosyne
Is childless in the night which she had made
Nor much with Science do I care to climb
Although by strange and subtle witchery
She drew the moon from heaven the Muse Time
Unrolls her gorgeous-coloured tapestry
To no less eager eyes often indeed
How Asia sent her myriad hosts to war
Against a little town and panoplied
In gilded mail with jewelled scimitar
White-shielded purple-crested rode the Mede
Between the waving poplars and the sea
Its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall
And on the nearer side a little brood
Of careless lions holding festival
And stood amazed at such hardihood
And pitched his tent upon the reedy shore
Some unfrequented height and coming down
The autumn forests treacherously slew
What Sparta held most dear and was the crown
Of far Eurotas and passed on nor knew
How God had staked an evil net for him
Its cadenced Greek delights me not I feel
With such a goodly time too out of tune
To love it much for like the Dial wheel
That from its blinded darkness strikes the noon
Yet never sees the sun so do my eyes
O for one grand unselfish simple life
To teach us what is Wisdom speak ye hills
Of lone Helvellyn for this note of strife
Shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills
Where is that Spirit which living blamelessly
Speak ye Rydalian laurels where is he
Whose gentle head ye sheltered that pure soul
Whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty
Through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal
Where love and duty mingle Him at least
But we are Learning changelings know by rote
The clarion watchword of each Grecian school
And follow none the flawless sword which smote
The pagan Hydra is an effete tool
Which we ourselves have blunted what man now
One such indeed I saw but Ichabod
Gone is that last dear son of Italy
Who being man died for the sake of God
And whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully
O guard him guard him well my Giotto tower
Of the rude tempest vex his slumber or
The Arno with its tawny troubled gold
O'er-leap its marge no mightier conqueror
Clomb the high Capitol in the days of old
When Rome was indeed Rome for Liberty
Fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell
With an old man who grabbled rusty keys
Fled shuddering for that immemorial knell
With which oblivion buries dynasties
Swept like a wounded eagle on the blast
He knew the holiest heart and heights of Rome
He drave the base wolf from the lion lair
And now lies dead by that empyreal dome
Which overtops Valdarno hung in air
By Brunelleschi O Melpomene
Breathe through the tragic stops such melodies
That Joy self may grow jealous and the Nine
Forget awhile their discreet emperies
Mourning for him who on Rome lordliest shrine
Lit for men lives the light of Marathon
O guard him guard him well my Giotto tower
Let some young Florentine each eventide
Bring coronals of that enchanted flower
Which the dim woods of Vallombrosa hide
And deck the marble tomb wherein he lies
Some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings
Being tempest-driven to the farthest rim
Where Chaos meets Creation and the wings
Of the eternal chanting Cherubim
Are pavilioned on Nothing passed away
He is not dead the immemorial Fates
Forbid it and the closing shears refrain
Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates
Ye argent clarions sound a loftier strain
For the vile thing he hated lurks within
Still what avails it that she sought her cave
That murderous mother of red harlotries
At Munich on the marble architrave
The Grecian boys die smiling but the seas
Which wash AEgina fret in loneliness
For lack of our ideals if one star
Flame torch-like in the heavens the unjust
Swift daylight kills it and no trump of war
Can wake to passionate voice the silent dust
Which was Mazzini once rich Niobe
What Easter Day shall make her children rise
Who were not Gods yet suffered what sure feet
Shall find their grave-clothes folded what clear eyes
Shall see them bodily O it were meet
To roll the stone from off the sepulchre
Our Italy our mother visible
Most blessed among nations and most sad
For whose dear sake the young Calabrian fell
That day at Aspromonte and was glad
That in an age when God was bought and sold
See Honour smitten on the cheek and gyves
Bind the sweet feet of Mercy Poverty
Creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives
Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily
And no word said O we are wretched men
Of austere Milton where the mighty sword
Which slew its master righteously the years
Have lost their ancient leader and no word
Breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears
While as a ruined mother in some spasm
Genders unlawful children Anarchy
Freedom own Judas the vile prodigal
Licence who steals the gold of Liberty
And yet has nothing Ignorance the real
One Fraticide since Cain Envy the asp
Is in its extent stiffened moneyed Greed
For whose dull appetite men waste away
Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed
Of things which slay their sower these each day
Sees rife in England and the gentle feet
What even Cromwell spared is desecrated
By weed and worm left to the stormy play
Of wind and beating snow or renovated
By more destructful hands Time worst decay
Will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness
Where is that Art which bade the Angels sing
Through Lincoln lofty choir till the air
Seems from such marble harmonies to ring
With sweeter song than common lips can dare
To draw from actual reed ah where is now
For Southwell arch and carved the House of One
Who loved the lilies of the field with all
Our dearest English flowers the same sun
Rises for us the seasons natural
Weave the same tapestry of green and grey
And yet perchance it may be better so
For Tyranny is an incestuous Queen
Murder her brother is her bedfellow
And the Plague chambers with her in obscene
And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set
For gentle brotherhood the harmony
Of living in the healthful air the swift
Clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free
And women chaste these are the things which lift
Our souls up more than even Agnolo's
Or Titian little maiden on the stair
White as her own sweet lily and as tall
Or Mona Lisa smiling through her hair 
Ah somehow life is bigger after all
Than any painted angel could we see
Which curbs the passion of that level line
Of marble youths who with untroubled eyes
And chastened limbs ride round Athena shrine
And mirror her divine economies
And balanced symmetry of what in man
Between our mother kisses and the grave
Might so inform our lives that we could win
Such mighty empires that from her cave
Temptation would grow hoarse and pallid Sin
Would walk ashamed of his adulteries
To make the body and the spirit one
With all right things till no thing live in vain
From morn to noon but in sweet unison
With every pulse of flesh and throb of brain
The soul in flawless essence high enthroned
Mark with serene impartiality
The strife of things and yet be comforted
Knowing that by the chain causality
All separate existences are wed
Into one supreme whole whose utterance
Of Life in most august omnipresence
Through which the rational intellect would find
In passion its expression and mere sense
Ignoble else lend fire to the mind
And being joined with it in harmony
Strike from their several tones one octave chord
Whose cadence being measureless would fly
Through all the circling spheres then to its Lord
Return refreshed with its new empery
And more exultant power this indeed
Ah it was easy when the world was young
To keep one life free and inviolate
From our sad lips another song is rung
By our own hands our heads are desecrate
Wanderers in drear exile and dispossessed
Somehow the grace the bloom of things has flown
And of all men we are most wretched who
Must live each other lives and not our own
For very pity sake and then undo
All that we lived for it was otherwise
But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
With weary feet to the new Calvary
Where we behold as one who in a glass
Sees his own face self-slain Humanity
And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze
O smitten mouth O forehead crowned with thorn
O chalice of all common miseries
Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne
An agony of endless centuries
And we were vain and ignorant nor knew
Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds
The night that covers and the lights that fade
The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds
The lips betraying and the life betrayed
The deep hath calm the moon hath rest but we
Is this the end of all that primal force
Which in its changes being still the same
From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course
Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame
Till the suns met in heaven and began
Nay nay we are but crucified and though
The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain
Loosen the nails we shall come down I know
Staunch the red wounds we shall be whole again
No need have we of hyssop-laden rod
That which is purely human that is godlike that is God
Prometheus I behold and I would fain
Exhort thee though already subtle enough
To a better wisdom Titan know thyself
And take new softness to thy manners since
A new king rules the gods If words like these
Harsh words and trenchant thou wilt fling abroad
Zeus haply though he sit so far and high
May hear thee do it and so this wrath of his
Which now affects thee fiercely shall appear
A mere child sport at vengeance Wretched god
Rather dismiss the passion which thou hast
And seek a change from grief Perhaps I seem
To address thee with old saws and outworn sense 
Yet such a curse Prometheus surely waits
On lips that speak too proudly thou meantime
Art none the meeker nor dost yield a jot
To evil circumstance preparing still
To swell the account of grief with other griefs
Than what are borne Beseech thee use me then
For counsel do not spurn against the pricks 
Seeing that who reigns reigns by cruelty
Instead of right And now I go from hence
And will endeavour if a power of mine
Can break thy fetters through For thee be calm
And smooth thy words from passion Knowest thou not
Of perfect knowledge thou who knowest too much
That where the tongue wags ruin never lags
I give thee gratulation and applause
Thou lackest no goodwill But as for deeds
Do nought 'twere all done vainly helping nought
Whatever thou wouldst do Rather take rest
And keep thyself from evil If I grieve
I do not therefore wish to multiply
The griefs of others Verily not so
For still my brother doom doth vex my soul 
My brother Atlas standing in the west
Shouldering the column of the heaven and earth
A difficult burden I have also seen
And pitied as I saw the earth-born one
The inhabitant of old Cilician caves
The great war-monster of the hundred heads
All taken and bowed beneath the violent Hand
Typhon the fierce who did resist the gods
And hissing slaughter from his dreadful jaws
Flash out ferocious glory from his eyes
As if to storm the throne of Zeus Whereat
The sleepless arrow of Zeus flew straight at him
The headlong bolt of thunder breathing flame
And struck him downward from his eminence
Of exultation through the very soul
It struck him and his strength was withered up
To ashes thunder-blasted Now he lies
A helpless trunk supinely at full length
Beside the strait of ocean spurred into
By roots of tna high upon whose tops
HephEstus sits and strikes the flashing ore
From thence the rivers of fire shall burst away
Hereafter and devour with savage jaws
The equal plains of fruitful Sicily
Such passion he shall boil back in hot darts
Of an insatiate fury and sough of flame
Fallen Typhon howsoever struck and charred
By Zeus bolted thunder But for thee
Thou art not so unlearned as to need
My teaching let thy knowledge save thyself
I quaff the full cup of a present doom
And wait till Zeus hath quenched his will in wrath
Beseech you think not I am silent thus
Through pride or scorn I only gnaw my heart
With meditation seeing myself so wronged
For see their honours to these new-made gods
What other gave but I and dealt them out
With distribution Ay but here I am dumb
For here I should repeat your knowledge to you
If I spake aught List rather to the deeds
I did for mortals how being fools before
I made them wise and true in aim of soul
And let me tell you not as taunting men
But teaching you the intention of my gifts
How first beholding they beheld in vain
And hearing heard not but like shapes in dreams
Mixed all things wildly down the tedious time
Nor knew to build a house against the sun
With wickered sides nor any woodcraft knew
But lived like silly ants beneath the ground
In hollow caves unsunned There came to them
No steadfast sign of winter nor of spring
Flower-perfumed nor of summer full of fruit
But blindly and lawlessly they did all things
Until I taught them how the stars do rise
And set in mystery and devised for them
Number the inducer of philosophies
The synthesis of Letters and beside
The artificer of all things Memory
That sweet Muse-mother I was first to yoke
The servile beasts in couples carrying
An heirdom of man burdens on their backs
I joined to chariots steeds that love the bit
They champ at the chief pomp of golden ease
And none but I originated ships
The seaman chariots wandering on the brine
With linen wings And I oh miserable 
Who did devise for mortals all these arts
Have no device left now to save myself
And marvel further what more arts and means
I did invent this greatest if a man
Fell sick there was no cure nor esculent
Nor chrism nor liquid but for lack of drugs
Men pined and wasted till I showed them all
Those mixtures of emollient remedies
Whereby they might be rescued from disease
I fixed the various rules of mantic art
Discerned the vision from the common dream
Instructed them in vocal auguries
Hard to interpret and defined as plain
The wayside omens flights of crook-clawed birds 
Showed which are by their nature fortunate
And which not so and what the food of each
And what the hates affections social needs
Of all to one another taught what sign
Of visceral lightness coloured to a shade
May charm the genial gods and what fair spots
Commend the lung and liver Burning so
The limbs encased in fat and the long chine
I led my mortals on to an art abstruse
And cleared their eyes to the image in the fire
Erst filmed in dark Enough said now of this
For the other helps of man hid underground
The iron and the brass silver and gold
Can any dare affirm he found them out
Before me none I know unless he choose
To lie in his vaunt In one word learn the whole 
That all arts came to mortals from Prometheus
But trust you nymphs and tell you all ye ask
In clear words though I sob amid my speech
In speaking of the storm-curse sent from Zeus
And of my beauty from what height it took
Its swoop on me poor wretch left thus deformed
And monstrous to your eyes For evermore
Around my virgin-chamber wandering went
The nightly visions which entreated me
With syllabled smooth sweetness Blessed maid
Why lengthen out thy maiden hours when fate
Permits the noblest spousal in the world
When Zeus burns with the arrow of thy love
And fain would touch thy beauty Maiden thou
Despise not Zeus depart to LernE mead
That green around thy father flocks and stalls
Until the passion of the heavenly Eye
Be quenched in sight Such dreams did all night long
Constrain me me unhappy till I dared
To tell my father how they trod the dark
With visionary steps Whereat he sent
His frequent heralds to the Pythian fane
And also to Dodona and inquired
How best by act or speech to please the gods
The same returning brought back oracles
Of doubtful sense indefinite response
Dark to interpret but at last there came
To Inachus an answer that was clear
Thrown straight as any bolt and spoken out 
This he should drive me from my home and land
And bid me wander to the extreme verge
Of all the earth or if he willed it not
Should have a thunder with a fiery eye
Leap straight from Zeus to burn up all his race
To the last root of it By which Loxian word
Subdued he drove me forth and shut me out
He loth me loth but Zeus violent bit
Compelled him to the deed when instantly
My body and soul were changEd and distraught
And hornEd as ye see and spurred along
By the fanged insect with a maniac leap
I rushed on to Cenchrea limpid stream
And LernE fountain-water There the earth-born
The herdsman Argus most immitigable
Of wrath did find me out and track me out
With countless eyes set staring at my steps
And though an unexpected sudden doom
Drew him from life I curse-tormented still
Am driven from land to land before the scourge
The gods hold o'er me So thou hast heard the past
And if a bitter future thou canst tell
Speak on I charge thee do not flatter me
Through pity with false words for in my mind
Deceiving works more shame than torturing doth
The uttermost of her wandering There it ends
But that she may be certain not to have heard
All vainly I will speak what she endured
Ere coming hither and invoke the past
To prove my prescience true And so to leave
A multitude of words and pass at once
To the subject of thy course when thou hadst gone
To those Molossian plains which sweep around
Dodona shouldering Heaven whereby the fane
Of Zeus Thesprotian keepeth oracle
And wonder past belief where oaks do wave
Articulate adjurations ay the same
Saluted thee in no perplexEd phrase
But clear with glory noble wife of Zeus
That shouldst be there some sweetness took thy sense
Thou didst rush further onward stung along
The ocean-shore toward Rhea mighty bay
And tost back from it wast tost to it again
In stormy evolution and know well
In coming time that hollow of the sea
Shall bear the name Ionian and present
A monument of Io passage through
Unto all mortals Be these words the signs
Of my soul power to look beyond the veil
Of visible things The rest to you and her
I will declare in common audience nymphs
Returning thither where my speech brake off
There is a town Canobus built upon
The earth fair margin at the mouth of Nile
And on the mound washed up by it Io there
Shall Zeus give back to thee thy perfect mind
And only by the pressure and the touch
Of a hand not terrible and thou to Zeus
Shalt bear a dusky son who shall be called
Thence Epaphus Touched That son shall pluck the fruit
Of all that land wide-watered by the flow
Of Nile but after him when counting out
As far as the fifth full generation then
Full fifty maidens a fair woman-race
Shall back to Argos turn reluctantly
To fly the proffered nuptials of their kin
Their father brothers These being passion struck
Like falcons bearing hard on flying doves
Shall follow hunting at a quarry of love
They should not hunt till envious Heaven maintain
A curse betwixt that beauty and their desire
And Greece receive them to be overcome
In murtherous woman-war by fierce red hands
Kept savage by the night For every wife
Shall slay a husband dyeing deep in blood
The sword of a double edge I wish indeed
As fair a marriage-joy to all my foes
One bride alone shall fail to smite to death
The head upon her pillow touched with love
Made impotent of purpose and impelled
To choose the lesser evil shame on her cheeks
Than blood-guilt on her hands which bride shall bear
A royal race in Argos Tedious speech
Were needed to relate particulars
Of these things 'tis enough that from her seed
Shall spring the strong He famous with the bow
Whose arm shall break my fetters off Behold
My mother Themis that old Titaness
Delivered to me such an oracle 
But how and when I should be long to speak
And thou in hearing wouldst not gain at all
This is not heaven even in a dream nor earth
As earth was once first breathed among the stars
Articulate glory from the mouth divine
To which the myriad spheres thrilled audibly
Touched like a lute-string and the sons of God
Said AMEN singing it I know that this
Is earth not new created but new cursed 
This Eden gate not opened but built up
With a final cloud of sunset Do I dream
Alas not so this is the Eden lost
By Lucifer the serpent this the sword
This sword alive with justice and with fire
That smote upon the forehead Lucifer
The angel Wherefore angel go depart
Here a brave earth to sin and suffer on
It holds fast still it cracks not under curse
It holds like mine immortal Presently
We'll sow it thick enough with graves as green
Or greener certes than its knowledge-tree
We'll have the cypress for the tree of life
More eminent for shadow for the rest
We'll build it dark with towns and pyramids
And temples if it please you we'll have feasts
And funerals also merrymakes and wars
Till blood and wine shall mix and run along
Right o'er the edges And good Gabriel
Ye like that word in heaven I too have strength 
Strength to behold Him and not worship Him
Strength to fall from Him and not cry on Him
Strength to be in the universe and yet
Neither God nor his servant The red sign
Burnt on my forehead which you taunt me with
Is God sign that it bows not unto God
The potter mark upon his work to show
It rings well to the striker I and the earth
I CHOSE this ruin I elected it
Of my will not of service What I do
I do volitient not obedient
And overtop thy crown with my despair
My sorrow crowns me Get thee back to heaven
And leave me to the earth which is mine own
In virtue of her ruin as I hers
In virtue of my revolt Turn thou from both
That bright impassive passive angelhood
And spare to read us backward any more
By the lie in me which I keep myself
Thou'rt a false swearer Were it otherwise
What dost thou here vouchsafing tender thoughts
To that earth-angel or earth-demon which
Thou and I have not solved the problem yet
Enough to argue that fallen Adam there 
That red-clay and a breath who must forsooth
Live in a new apocalypse of sense
With beauty and music waving in his trees
And running in his rivers to make glad
His soul made perfect is it not for hope
A hope within thee deeper than thy truth
Of finally conducting him and his
To fill the vacant thrones of me and mine
Which affront heaven with their vacuity
Which seals the gate up to the final doom
Is God seal manifest There seem to lie
A hundred thunders in it dark and dead
The unmolten lightnings vein it motionless
And outward from its depth the self-moved sword
Swings slow its awful gnomon of red fire
From side to side in pendulous horror slow
Across the stagnant ghastly glare thrown flat
On the intermediate ground from that to this
The angelic hosts the archangelic pomps
Thrones dominations princedoms rank on rank
Rising sublimely to the feet of God
On either side and overhead the gate
Show like a glittering and sustainEd smoke
Drawn to an apex That their faces shine
Betwixt the solemn clasping of their wings
Clasped high to a silver point above their heads 
We only guess from hence and not discern
Thine Eve thy life which suits me little now
Seeing that I now confess myself thy death
And thine undoer as the snake was mine 
I do adjure thee put me straight away
Together with my name Sweet punish me
O Love be just and ere we pass beyond
The light cast outward by the fiery sword
Into the dark which earth must be to us
Bruise my head with thy foot as the curse said
My seed shall the first tempter strike with curse
As God struck in the garden and as HE
Being satisfied with justice and with wrath
Did roll his thunder gentler at the close 
Thou peradventure mayst at last recoil
To some soft need of mercy Strike my lord
I also after tempting writhe on the ground
And I would feed on ashes from thine hand
Who gave the right and joyaunce of the world
Both unto thee and me gave thee to me
The best gift last the last sin was the worst
Which sinned against more complement of gifts
And grace of giving God I render back
Strong benediction and perpetual praise
From mortal feeble lips as incense-smoke
Out of a little censer may fill heaven
That thou in striking my benumbEd hands
And forcing them to drop all other boons
Of beauty and dominion and delight 
Hast left this well-beloved Eve this life
Within life this best gift between their palms
Running as it might seem my life from me
They run so fast and warm Let me lie so
And weep so as if in a dream or prayer
Unfastening clasp by clasp the hard tight thought
Which clipped my heart and showed me evermore
Loathed of thy justice as I loathe the snake
And as the pure ones loathe our sin To-day
All day beloved as we fled across
This desolating radiance cast by swords
Not suns my lips prayed soundless to myself
Striking against each other O Lord God
'Twas so I prayed I ask Thee by my sin
And by thy curse and by thy blameless heavens
Make dreadful haste to hide me from thy face
And from the face of my beloved here
For whom I am no helpmeet quick away
Into the new dark mystery of death
I will lie still there I will make no plaint
I will not sigh nor sob nor speak a word
Nor struggle to come back beneath the sun
Where peradventure I might sin anew
Against thy mercy and his pleasure Death
O death whatever it be is good enough
For such as I am while for Adam here
No voice shall say again in heaven or earth
Who thought me once part worthy of her ear
And somewhat wiser than the other beasts 
Drawing together her large globes of eyes
The light of which is throbbing in and out
Their steadfast continuity of gaze 
Knots her fair eyebrows in so hard a knot
And down from her white heights of womanhood
Looks on me so amazed I scarce should fear
To wager such an apple as she plucked
Against one riper from the tree of life
That she could curse too as a woman may 
For this time he speaks truth which we should hear
And asks for mercy which I most should grant
In like wise as he tells us in like wise
And therefore I thee pardon Lucifer
As freely as the streams of Eden flowed
When we were happy by them So depart
Leave us to walk the remnant of our time
Out mildly in the desert Do not seek
To harm us any more or scoff at us
Or ere the dust be laid upon our face
To find there the communion of the dust
Thou canst not choose but think as I praise God
Unwillingly but fully that I stand
Most absolute in beauty As yourselves
Were fashioned very good at best so we
Sprang very beauteous from the creant Word
Which thrilled behind us God himself being moved
When that august work of a perfect shape
His dignities of sovran angel-hood
Swept out into the universe divine
With thunderous movements earnest looks of gods
And silver-solemn clash of cymbal wings
Whereof was I in motion and in form
A part not poorest And yet yet perhaps
This beauty which I speak of is not here
As God voice is not here nor even my crown 
I do not know What is this thought or thing
Which I call beauty Is it thought or thing
Is it a thought accepted for a thing
Or both or neither a pretext a word
Its meaning flutters in me like a flame
Under my own breath my perceptions reel
For evermore around it and fall off
Like what coil like the serpent when he fell
From all the emerald splendour of his height
And writhed and could not climb against the curse
Not a ring length I am afraid afraid 
I think it is God will to make me afraid 
Permitting THESE to haunt us in the place
Of his belovEd angels gone from us
Because we are not pure Dear Pity of God
That didst permit the angels to go home
And live no more with us who are not pure
Save us too from a loathly company 
Almost as loathly in our eyes perhaps
As we are in the purest Pity us 
Us too nor shut us in the dark away
From verity and from stability
Or what we name such through the precedence
Of earth adjusted uses leave us not
To doubt betwixt our senses and our souls
Which are the more distraught and full of pain
Which rounds us with a visionary dread
Responding with twelve shadowy signs of earth
In fantasque apposition and approach
To those celestial constellated twelve
Which palpitate adown the silent nights
Under the pressure of the hand of God
Stretched wide in benediction At this hour
Not a star pricketh the flat gloom of heaven
But girdling close our nether wilderness
The zodiac-figures of the earth loom slow 
Drawn out as suiteth with the place and time
In twelve colossal shades instead of stars
Through which the ecliptic line of mystery
Strikes bleakly with an unrelenting scope
As earth contains it Gaze on them beloved
By stricter apprehension of the sight
Suggestions of the creatures shall assuage
The terror of the shadows what is known
Subduing the unknown and taming it
From all prodigious dread That phantasm there
Presents a lion albeit twenty times
As large as any lion with a roar
Set soundless in his vibratory jaws
And a strange horror stirring in his mane
And there a pendulous shadow seems to weigh 
Good against ill perchance and there a crab
Puts coldly out its gradual shadow-claws
Like a slow blot that spreads till all the ground
Crawled over by it seems to crawl itself
A bull stands hornEd here with gibbous glooms
And a ram likewise and a scorpion writhes
Its tail in ghastly slime and stings the dark
This way a goat leaps with wild blank of beard
And here fantastic fishes duskly float
Using the calm for waters while their fins
Throb out quick rhythms along the shallow air
I pray you humbly in the name of God
Not to say of these tears which are impure 
Grant me such pardoning grace as can go forth
From clean volitions toward a spotted will
From the wronged to the wronger this and no more
I do not ask more I am 'ware indeed
That absolute pardon is impossible
From you to me by reason of my sin 
And that I cannot evermore as once
With worthy acceptation of pure joy
Behold the trances of the holy hills
Beneath the leaning stars or watch the vales
Dew-pallid with their morning ecstasy 
Or hear the winds make pastoral peace between
Two grassy uplands and the river-wells
Work out their bubbling mysteries underground 
And all the birds sing till for joy of song
They lift their trembling wings as if to heave
The too-much weight of music from their heart
And float it up the Ether I am 'ware
That these things I can no more apprehend
With a pure organ into a full delight 
The sense of beauty and of melody
Being no more aided in me by the sense
Of personal adjustment to those heights
Of what I see well-formed or hear well-tuned
But rather coupled darkly and made ashamed
By my percipiency of sin and fall
In melancholy of humiliant thoughts
But oh fair dreadful Spirits albeit this
Your accusation must confront my soul
And your pathetic utterance and full gaze
Must evermore subdue me be content
Conquer me gently as if pitying me
Not to say loving let my tears fall thick
As watering dews of Eden unreproached
And when your tongues reprove me make me smooth
Not ruffled smooth and still with your reproof
And peradventure better while more sad
For look to it sweet Spirits look well to it
It will not be amiss in you who kept
The law of your own righteousness and keep
The right of your own griefs to mourn themselves 
To pity me twice fallen from that and this
From joy of place and also right of wail
I wail being not for me only I sin
At that last sunset seen in Paradise
When all the westering clouds flashed out in throngs
Of sudden angel-faces face by face
All hushed and solemn as a thought of God
Held them suspended was I not that hour
The lady of the world princess of life
Mistress of feast and favour Could I touch
A rose with my white hand but it became
Redder at once Could I walk leisurely
Along our swarded garden but the grass
Tracked me with greenness Could I stand aside
A moment underneath a cornel-tree
But all the leaves did tremble as alive
With songs of fifty birds who were made glad
Because I stood there Could I turn to look
With these twain eyes of mine now weeping fast
Now good for only weeping upon man
Angel or beast or bird but each rejoiced
Because I looked on him Alas alas
And is not this much woe to cry alas
Speaking of joy And is not this more shame
To have made the woe myself from all that joy
To have stretched my hand and plucked it from the tree
And chosen it for fruit Nay is not this
Still most despair to have halved that bitter fruit
And ruined so the sweetest friend I have
Turning the GREATEST to mine enemy
O Spirits have patience 'stead of reverence
And let me speak for not being innocent
It little doth become me to be proud
And I am prescient by the very hope
And promise set upon me that henceforth
Only my gentleness shall make me great
My humbleness exalt me Awful Spirits
Be witness that I stand in your reproof
But one sun length off from my happiness 
Happy as I have said to look around
Clear to look up And now I need not speak 
Ye see me what I am ye scorn me so
Because ye see me what I have made myself
From God best making Alas peace forgone
Love wronged and virtue forfeit and tears wept
Upon all vainly Alas me alas
Who have undone myself from all that best
Fairest and sweetest to this wretchedest
Saddest and most defiled cast out cast down 
What word metes absolute loss let absolute loss
Suffice you for revenge For I who lived
Beneath the wings of angels yesterday
Wander to-day beneath the roofless world
I reigning the earth empress yesterday
Put off from me to-day your hate with prayers
I yesterday who answered the Lord God
Composed and glad as singing-birds the sun
Might shriek now from our dismal desert God
And hear him make reply What is thy need
Who yesterday was helpmate and delight
Unto mine Adam am to-day the grief
And curse-mete for him And so pity us
Ye gentle Spirits and pardon him and me
And let some tender peace made of our pain
Grow up betwixt us as a tree might grow
With boughs on both sides In the shade of which
When presently ye shall behold us dead 
For the poor sake of our humility
Breathe out your pardon on our breathless lips
And drop your twilight dews against our brows
And stroking with mild airs our harmless hands
Left empty of all fruit perceive your love
Distilling through your pity over us
And suffer it self-reconciled to pass
Of expiation wrought by loss and fall
Of hate subduable to pity Eve
Take counsel from thy counsellor the snake
And boast no more in grief nor hope from pain
My docile Eve I teach you to despond
Who taught you disobedience Look around 
Earth spirits and phantasms hear you talk unmoved
As if ye were red clay again and talked
What are your words to them your grief to them 
Your deaths indeed to them Did the hand pause
For their sake in the plucking of the fruit
That they should pause for you in hating you
Or will your grief or death as did your sin
Bring change upon their final doom Behold
Your grief is but your sin in the rebound
Took us in Eden On a mountain-peak
Half-sheathed in primal woods and glittering
In spasms of awful sunshine at that hour
A lion couched part raised upon his paws
With his calm massive face turned full on thine
And his mane listening When the ended curse
Left silence in the world right suddenly
He sprang up rampant and stood straight and stiff
As if the new reality of death
Were dashed against his eyes and roared so fierce
Such thick carnivorous passion in his throat
Tearing a passage through the wrath and fear
And roared so wild and smote from all the hills
Such fast keen echoes crumbling down the vales
Precipitately that the forest beasts
One after one did mutter a response
Of savage and of sorrowful complaint
Which trailed along the gorges Then at once
He fell back and rolled crashing from the height
That I struck out from nature in a blot
The outcast and the mildew of things good
The leper of angels the excepted dust
Under the common rain of daily gifts 
I the snake I the tempter I the cursed 
To whom the highest and the lowest alike
Say Go from us we have no need of thee 
Was made by God like others Good and fair
He did create me ask him if not fair
Ask if I caught not fair and silverly
His blessing for chief angels on my head
Until it grew there a crown crystallized
Ask if he never called me by my name
Lucifer kindly said as Gabriel 
Lucifer soft as Michael while serene
I standing in the glory of the lamps
Answered my Father innocent of shame
And of the sense of thunder Ha ye think
White angels in your niches I repent
And would tread down my own offences back
To service at the footstool that read wrong
I cry as the beast did that I may cry 
Expansive not appealing Fallen so deep
Against the sides of this prodigious pit
I cry cry dashing out the hands of wail
On each side to meet anguish everywhere
And to attest it in the ecstasy
And exaltation of a woe sustained
Adam and Eve Say grace as after meat
After my curses May your tears fall hot
On all the hissing scorns o' the creatures here 
And yet rejoice Increase and multiply
Ye in your generations in all plagues
Corruptions melancholies poverties
And hideous forms of life and fears of death 
The thought of death being always imminent
Immoveable and dreadful in your life
And deafly and dumbly insignificant
Of any hope beyond as death itself
Whichever of you lieth dead the first
Shall seem to the survivor yet rejoice
My curse catch at you strongly body and soul
And HE find no redemption nor the wing
Of seraph move your way and yet rejoice
Rejoice because ye have not set in you
This hate which shall pursue you this fire-hate
Which glares without because it burns within 
Which kills from ashes this potential hate
Wherein I angel in antagonism
To God and his reflex beatitudes
Moan ever in the central universe
With the great woe of striving against Love 
And gasp for space amid the Infinite
And toss for rest amid the Desertness
Self-orphaned by my will and self-elect
To kingship of resistant agony
Toward the Good round me hating good and love
And willing to hate good and to hate love
And willing to will on so evermore
Scorning the past and damning the to-come 
HERE where Vespasian legions struck the sands
And Cerdic with his Saxons entered in
And Henry army leapt afloat to win
Convincing triumphs over neighbour lands
Vaster battalions press for further strands
To argue in the self-same bloody mode
Which this late age of thought and pact and code
Still fails to mend Now deckward tramp the bands
Yellow as autumn leaves alive as spring
And as each host draws out upon the sea
Beyond which lies the tragical To-be
None dubious of the cause none murmuring
Wives sisters parents wave white hands and smile
As if they knew not that they weep the while
WHILE the far farewell music thins and fails
And the broad bottoms rip the bearing brine 
All smalling slowly to the gray sea line 
And each significant red smoke-shaft pales
Keen sense of severance everywhere prevails
Which shapes the late long tramp of mounting men
To seeming words that ask and ask again
How long O striving Teutons Slavs and Gaels
Must your wroth reasonings trade on lives like these
That are as puppets in a playing hand 
When shall the saner softer polities
Whereof we dream have play in each proud land
And patriotism grown Godlike scorn to stand
Bondslave to realms but circle earth and seas
THE quay recedes Hurrah Ahead we go 
It true I've been accustomed now to home
And joints get rusty and one limbs may grow
But I can stand as yet fair stress and strain
There not a little steel beneath the rust
My years mount somewhat but here to't again
God knows that for myself I've scanty care
Past scrimmages have proved as much to all
In Eastern lands and South I've had my share
And where those villains ripped me in the flitch
With their old iron in my early time
I'm apt at change of wind to feel a twitch
And what my mirror shows me in the morning
Has more of blotch and wrinkle than of bloom
My eyes too heretofore all glasses scorning
Now sounds 'The Girl I've left behind me' Ah
The years the ardours wakened by that tune
Time was when with the crowd farewell 'Hurrah
But now it late to leave behind me one
Who if poor soul her man goes underground
Will not recover as she might have done
She waving from the wharfside palely grieving
As down we draw Her tears make little show
Yet now she suffers more than at my leaving
I pray those left at home will care for her
I shall come back I have before though when
The Girl you leave behind you is a grandmother
THESE numbered cliffs and gnarls of masonry
Outskeleton Time central city Rome
Whereof each arch entablature and dome
Lies bare in all its gaunt anatomy
And cracking frieze and rotten metope
Express as though they were an open tome
Top-lined with caustic monitory gnome
Dunces Learn here to spell Humanity
And yet within these ruins' very shade
The singing workmen shape and set and join
Their frail new mansion stuccoed cove and quoin
With no apparent sense that years abrade
Though each rent wall their feeble works invade
Once shamed all such in power of pier and groin
THIRTY-TWO years since up against the sun
Seven shapes thin atomies to lower sight
Labouringly leapt and gained thy gabled height
And four lives paid for what the seven had won
They were the first by whom the deed was done
And when I look at thee my mind takes flight
To that day tragic feat of manly might
As though till then of history thou hadst none
Yet ages ere men topped thee late and soon
Thou watch'dst each night the planets lift and lower
Thou gleam'dst to Joshua pausing sun and moon
And brav'dst the tokening sky when Caesar power
Approached its bloody end yea saw'st that Noon
When darkness filled the earth till the ninth hour
IF but some vengeful god would call to me
From up the sky and laugh Thou suffering thing
Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy
That thy love loss is my hate profiting
Then would I bear and clench myself and die
Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited
Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I
Had willed and meted me the tears I shed
But not so How arrives it joy lies slain
And why unblooms the best hope ever sown
 Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain
And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan 
These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown
Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain
IN vision I roamed the flashing Firmament
So fierce in blazon that the Night waxed wan
As though with an awed sense of such ostent
And as I thought my spirit ranged on and on
In footless traverse through ghast heights of sky
To the last chambers of the monstrous Dome
Where stars the brightest here to darkness die
Then any spot on our own Earth seemed Home
And the sick grief that you were far away
Grew pleasant thankfulness that you were near
Who might have been set on some outstep sphere
Less than a Want to me as day by day
I lived unware uncaring all that lay
Locked in that Universe taciturn and drear
WHEN you paced forth to wait maternity
A dream of other offspring held my mind
Compounded of us twain as Love designed
Rare forms that corporate now will never be
Should I too wed as slave to Mode decree
And each thus found apart of false desire
A stolid line whom no high aims will fire
As had fired ours could ever have mingled we
And grieved that lives so matched should mis-compose
Each mourn the double waste and question dare
To the Great Dame whence incarnation flows
Why those high-purposed children never were
What will she answer That she does not care
If the race all such sovereign types unknows
YOUR troubles shrink not though I feel them less
Here far away than when I tarried near
I even smile old smiles with listlessness 
Yet smiles they are not ghastly mockeries mere
A thought too strange to house within my brain
Haunting its outer precincts I discern
 That I will not show zeal again to learn
Your griefs and sharing them renew my pain 
It goes like murky bird or buccaneer
That shapes its lawless figure on the main
And each new impulse tends to make outflee
The unseemly instinct that had lodgment here
Yet comrade old can bitterer knowledge be
Than that though banned such instinct was in me
THE two were silent in a sunless church
Whose mildewed walls uneven paving-stones
And wasted carvings passed antique research
And nothing broke the clock dull monotones
Leaning against a wormy poppy-head
So wan and worn that he could scarcely stand
 For he was soon to die he softly said
Tell me you love me holding hard her hand
She would have given a world to breathe yes truly
So much his life seemed handing on her mind
And hence she lied her heart persuaded throughly
'Twas worth her soul to be a moment kind
But the sad need thereof his nearing death
So mocked humanity that she shamed to prize
A world conditioned thus or care for breath
Where Nature such dilemmas could devise
THOUGH I waste watches framing words to fetter
Some spirit to mine own in clasp and kiss
Out of the night there looms a sense 'twere better
To fail obtaining whom one fails to miss
For winning love we win the risk of losing
And losing love is as one life were riven
It cuts like contumely and keen ill-using
To cede what was superfluously given
Let me then feel no more the fateful thrilling
That devastates the love-worn wooer frame
The hot ado of fevered hopes the chilling
That agonizes disappointed aim
So may I live no junctive law fulfilling
And my heart table bear no woman name
WHEN you shall see me in the toils of Time
My lauded beauties carried off from me
My eyes no longer stars as in their prime
My name forgot of Maiden Fair and Free
When in your being heart concedes to mind
And judgment though you scarce its process know
Recalls the excellencies I once enshrined
And you are irked that they have withered so
Remembering that with me lies not the blame
That Sportsman Time but rears his brood to kill
Knowing me in my soul the very same 
One who would die to spare you touch of ill 
Will you not grant to old affection claim
The hand of friendship down Life sunless hill
PERHAPS long hence when I have passed away
Some other feature accent thought like mine
Will carry you back to what I used to say
And bring some memory of your love decline
Then you may pause awhile and think Poor jade
And yield a sigh to me as ample due
Not as the tittle of a debt unpaid
To one who could resign her all to you 
And thus reflecting you will never see
That your thin thought in two small words conveyed
Was no such fleeting phantom-thought to me
But the Whole Life wherein my part was played
And you amid its fitful masquerade
A Thought as I in yours but seem to be
I WILL be faithful to thee aye I will
And Death shall choose me with a wondering eye
That he did not discern and domicile
One his by right ever since that last Good-bye
I have no care for friends or kin or prime
Of manhood who deal gently with me here
Amid the happy people of my time
Who work their love fulfilment I appear
Numb as a vane that cankers on its point
True to the wind that kissed ere canker came
Despised by souls of Now who would disjoint
The mind from memory and make Life all aim
My old dexterities of hue quite gone
And nothing left for Love to look upon
This love puts all humanity from me
I can but maledict her pray her dead
For giving love and getting love of thee 
Feeding a heart that else mine own had fed
How much I love I know not life not known
Save as some unit I would add love by
But this I know my being is but thine own 
Fused from its separateness by ecstasy
And thus I grasp thy amplitudes of her
Ungrasped though helped by nigh-regarding eyes
Canst thou then hate me as an envier
Who see unrecked what I so dearly prize
Believe me Lost One Love is lovelier
The more it shapes its moan in selfish-wise
THE sun had wheeled from Grey to Dammer Crest
And still I mused on that Thing imminent
At length I sought the High-street to the West
The level flare raked pane and pediment
And my wrecked face and shaped my nearing friend
Like one of those the Furnace held unshent
I've news concerning her he said Attend
They fly to-night at the late moon first gleam
Watch with thy steel two righteous thrusts will end
Her shameless visions and his passioned dream
I'll watch with thee to testify thy wrong 
To aid maybe Law consecrates the scheme
I started and we paced the flags along
Till I replied Since it has come to this
I'll do it But alone I can be strong
Three hours past Curfew when the Froom mild hiss
Reigned sole undulled by whirr of merchandize
From Pummery-Tout to where the Gibbet is
I crossed my pleasaunce hard by Glyd'path Rise
And stood beneath the wall Eleven strokes went
And to the door they came contrariwise
And met in clasp so close I had but bent
My lifted blade upon them to have let
Their two souls loose upon the firmament
But something held my arm A moment yet
As pray-time ere you wantons die I said
And then they saw me Swift her gaze was set
With eye and cry of love illimited
Upon her Heart-king Never upon me
Had she thrown look of love so thorough-sped 
At once she flung her faint form shieldingly
On his against the vengeance of my vows
The which o'erruling her shape shielded he
Blanked by such love I stood as in a drowse
And the slow moon edged from the upland nigh
My sad thoughts moving thuswise I may house
And I may husband her yet what am I
But licensed tyrant to this bonded pair
Says Charity Do as ye would be done by 
Hurling my iron to the bushes there
I bade them stay And as if brain and breast
Were passive they walked with me to the stair
Inside the house none watched and on we prest
Before a mirror in whose gleam I read
Her beauty his and mine own mien unblest
Till at her room I turned Madam I said
Have you the wherewithal for this Pray speak
Love fills no cupboard You'll need daily bread
We've nothing sire said she and nothing seek
'Twere base in me to rob my lord unware
Our hands will earn a pittance week by week
And next I saw she'd piled her raiment rare
Within the garde-robes and her household purse
Her jewels and least lace of personal wear
And stood in homespun Now grown wholly hers
I handed her the gold her jewels all
And him the choicest of her robes diverse
I'll take you to the doorway in the wall
And then adieu I to them Friends withdraw
They did so and she went beyond recall
And as I paused beneath the arch I saw
Their moonlit figures slow as in surprise 
Descend the slope and vanish on the haw
'Fool' some will say I thought But who is wise
Save God alone to weigh my reasons why
 Hast thou struck home came with the boughs' night-sighs
It was my friend I have struck well They fly
But carry wounds that none can cicatrize
 Not mortal said he Lingering worse said I
NOW that my page upcloses doomed maybe
Never to press thy cosy cushions more
Or wake thy ready Yeas as heretofore
Or stir thy gentle vows of faith in me
Knowing thy natural receptivity
I figure that as flambeaux banish eve
My sombre image warped by insidious heave
Of those less forthright must lose place in thee
So be it I have borne such Let thy dreams
Of me and mine diminish day by day
And yield their space to shine of smugger things
Till I shape to thee but in fitful gleams
And then in far and feeble visitings
And then surcease Truth will be truth alway
No tale of streaming plumes and harness bright
Dwells on the poet maiden harp to-night
No trumpet clamour and no battle fire
Breathes in the trembling accents of his lyre
Enough for him if in his lowly strain
He wakes one household echo not in vain
Enough for him if in his boldest word
The beating heart of MAN be dimly heard
Its solemn music which like strains that sigh
Through charmEd gardens all who hearing die
Its solemn music he does not pursue
To distant ages out of human view
Nor listen to its wild and mournful chime
In the dead caverns on the shore of Time
But musing with a calm and steady gaze
Before the crackling flames of living days
He hears it whisper through the busy roar
Of what shall be and what has been before
Awake the Present Shall no scene display
The tragic passion of the passing day
Is it with Man as with some meaner things
That out of death his single purpose springs
Can his eventful life no moral teach
Until he be for aye beyond its reach
Obscurely shall he suffer act and fade
Dubb'd noble only by the sexton spade
Awake the Present Though the steel-clad age
Find life alone within its storied page
Iron is worn at heart by many still 
The tyrant Custom binds the serf-like will
If the sharp rack and screw and chain be gone
These later days have tortures of their own
The guiltless writhe while Guilt is stretch'd in sleep
And Virtue lies too often dungeon deep
Awake the Present what the Past has sown
Be in its harvest garner'd reap'd and grown
How pride breeds pride and wrong engenders wrong
Read in the volume Truth has held so long
Assured that where life flowers freshest blow
The sharpest thorns and keenest briars grow
How social usage has the pow'r to change
Good thoughts to evil in its highest range
To cramp the noble soul and turn to ruth
The kindling impulse of our glorious youth
Crushing the spirit in its house of clay
Learn from the lessons of the present day
Not light its import and not poor its mien
Yourselves the actors and your homes the scene
In some there lies a sorrow too profound
To find a voice or to reveal itself
Throughout the strain of daily toil or thought
Or during converse born of souls allied
As aught men understand And though mayhap
Their cheeks will thin or droop and wane their eyes
Frank lustre hair may lose its hue or fall
And health may slacken low in force and they
Are older than the warrant of their years
Yet they to others seem to gild their lives
With cheerfulness and every duty tend
As if their aspects told the truth within
But they are not as others not for them
The bounding pulse and ardour of desire
The rapture and the wonder in things new
The hope that palpitating enters where
Perfection smiles on universal life
Nor do they with elastic enterprise
Forecast delight in compassing results
Nor having won their ends fall godlike back
And taste the calm completion of content
But in a sober chilled grey atmosphere
Work out their lives more various though they are
Than creatures in the unknown ocean depths
Yet each in whom this vital grief has root
Is dull to what makes everything of worth
And though may be a shallow bodily joy
Oft tingles through them at the breathing spring
Or first-heard exultation of the lark
Still that deep weight draws ever steadily
Their thoughts and passions back to secret woe
Though if endowed with light heroic deeds
May be achieved and if benignly bent
They may be treasured blessings through their lives
Yet power and goodness are to them as dreams
And they heed vaguely if their waking sight
Be met with slanting storm against the pane
Or sunshine glittering on the leaves that play
In purest blue of breezy summer morns
Whence springs this well of mournfulness profound
Unfathomable to plummet cast by man
Alas for who can tell Whence comes the wind
Heaving the ocean into maddened arms
That clutch and dash huge vessels on the rocks
And scatter them as if compacted slight
As little eggs boys star against a tree
In wanton mischief Whence detestable
To man who suffers from the monster-jaws
The power that in the logging crocodiles
Outrageous bulk puts evil fire of life
That spouts from mountain-pyramids a flood
Of lava overwhelming works and men
In burning fetid ruin The power that stings
A city with a pestilence or turns
The pretty babe who in his mother lap
Babbles her back the lavished kiss and laugh
Through lusts and vassalage to obdurate sin
Into a knife-armed midnight murderer
Our lives are mysteries and rarely scanned
As we read stories writ by mortal pen
We can perchance but catch a straying weft
And trace the hinted texture here or there
Of that stupendous loom weaving our fates
Two parents late in life are haply blessed
With one bright child a wonder in his years
For loveliness and genius versatile
Some common ill destroys him parents both
Until their death are left but living tombs
That hold the one dead image of their joy
A man the flower of honour who has found
His well-beloved young daughter fled from home
Fallen from her maidenhood a nameless thing
Tainting his blood A youth who throws the strength
Of his whole being into love for one
Answering him honeyed smiles and leaves his land
For some far country seeking wealth he hopes
Will grace her daintily with choice delights
And on returning sees the honeyed smiles
Are sweetening other lips A husband who
Has found that household curse a faithless wife
A thinker whose far-piercing care perceives
His nation goes the road that ends in shame
A gracious woman whose reserve denies
The power to utter what consumes her heart
Such instances and some a loss to know
Which steadfast reticence will shield from those
Debased or garrulous whose hearts corrupt
But learn the gloomy secrets of their kind
To poison-tip their wit or grope and grin
With pharisaic laughter at disgrace 
Such instances as these demand no guide
To thrid the dismal issues from their source
But others are there lying fast concealed
Dark hopeless and unutterably sad
Which have not been and never may be known
Then we may well call happy one whose grief
Mixed up with sacred memories of the past
Can tell to others how the tempest rose
That struck and left him lonely in the world
And who narrating feels his sorrow soothed
By that respect which love and sorrow claim
It much behoves us all but chiefly those
Whom fate has favoured with an easy trust
To keep a bridle upon restless speech
And thought and not in flagrant haste prejudge
The first presentment as the rounded truth
For true it is that rapid thoughts and freak
Of skimming word and glance more frequently
Than either malice settled hate or scorn
Support confusion and pervert the right
Set up the weakling in the strong man place
And yoke the great one strength to idleness
Pour gold into the squanderer purse and suck
The wealth which is a power from their control
Who would have turned it unto noble use
And oftentimes a man will strike his friend
By random verbiage with sharper pain
Than could a foe yet scarcely mean him wrong
For none can strip this complex masquerade
And know who languishes with secret wounds
They whom the brunt of war has maimed in limb
Who lean on crutches to sustain their weight
Are manifest to all and reverence
For their misfortunes kindly gains them place
But wounds sometimes more deep and dangerous
We may in careless jostle through the crowd
Gall and oppress because to us unknown
Then howsoever by our needs impelled
Let us resolve to move in gentleness
Judge mildly when we doubt and pause awhile
Before injustice palpably proclaimed
Ere we let fall the judgment stroke against
Their ignominious craft who ever wait
To filch another right we will maintain
Majestic peace in silence knowing well
Their craft takes something richer from themselves
It is but seemly to respect the great
But never let us fail toward lowly ones
Respecting more in that they lack the force
To claim it of the world For souls there are
Of poor capacities whose purpose holds
Throughout their unregarded lives a worth
And earnest law of fixed integrity
That were an honour even unto those
Whose genius marks the boundaries of our race
Love comes divinely gladdening mortal life
As sunrise dawns upon the gaze of one
Bewildered in some outland waste and lost
Who lonely faint and shuddering through the night
Heard savage creatures nigh and far-off moan
Of tempests on the wind Auroral joy
Flushes the brow of childhood warms his cheek
To rosier redness at the name of Love
And earlier thoughts awake in darkness strive
As unfledged nestlings move their sightless heads
At sound toward a fair world to them unknown
Young Hope scales azure mountain heights to gaze
In Love first golden and delicious dream
He sees the earth a maze of tempting paths
For blissful sauntering mid the crowded flowers
And music of the rills No ambushed wrongs
Or thwarting storms there baffle and surprise
But lingering man treads long an odorous way
And at the close with Love clasped hand in hand
Sets in proud glory thence to rise anon
With Love beyond the stars and rest in heaven
Man nerved by Love can steadily endure
Clash of opposing interests perplexed web
Of crosses that distracting clog advance
In thickest storm of contest waxes stronger
At momentary thought of home of her
His gracious wife and bright-faced joys
The wrinkled patriarch who sits and suns
His shrunken form beneath the boughs he climbed
A lissom boy whence comes that brooding smile
Whose secret lifts his cheeks and overflows
His sight with tender dew What through his frame
Melts languor sweeter than approaching sleep
To one made weary by a hard day toil
It is the memory of primal love
Whose visionary splendour steeped his life
In hues of heaven and which grown open day
Revealing perilous falls his steps confined
Within the pathways to the noblest end
Now following this dimmed glory tired his soul
Haunts ever the mysterious gates of Death
And waits in patient reverence till his doom
Unfolding them fulfils immortal Love
As from some height on a wild day of cloud
A wanderer chilled and worn perchance beholds
Move toward him through the landscape soaked in gloom
A golden beam of light creating lakes
And verdant pasture farms and villages
And touching spires atop to flickering flame
Disclosing herds of sober feeding kine
And brightening on its way the woods to song
As he that wanderer brightens when the shaft
Suddenly falls on him A moment warmed
He scarcely feels its loveliness before
The light departing leaves his saddened soul
More cold than ere it came Thus love once shone
And blessed my life so vanished into gloom
What trite old folly unharmonious sages
In dull books write or prattle day by day
Of sin original and growing crime
And commentating the advance of time
Say wrong has fostered wrong for countless ages
The strong ones marking down the weak for prey
They bruit of wars that thunder heard in dreams
Huge insurrections and dynastic changes
Resolved in blood I marvel they of thought
By apprehensions are so often wrought
To state as fact what unto all men seems
Who watch cloud-struggles blown through stormy ranges
Why fill they not with love the printed page
Illuminating as yon moon the night
Serenely shining on a world of beauty
Where love moves ever hand in hand with duty
And life a long aspiring pilgrimage
Makes labour but a pastime of delight
It was delightfulness to him I found
Whistling this afternoon behind his team
That stepped an easy comfortable pace
While off the mould-iron curved in rolling grace
Dark earth wave lapping wave without a sound
And all passed by me blissful like a dream
And those I noticed hoeing on the hill
Talking familiarly of homely things
A daughter marriage-day a son first child
How the good Squire at length was reconciled
Had overlooked the pheasant shot by Will 
Chirruping on as any cricket sings
And that complete Arcadian pastoral
The piping boy who watched his feeding sheep
And as a little bird o'erflows with joy
Piped on for hours my happy shepherd boy
While coiled below his faithful animal
Basked in the sunshine blinking half asleep
This silent night-wind bloweth heavenly pure
Like dimpled warmth of an infantine face
Lo glimmering starlike in yon balmy vale
The village lights each tells a little tale
Of humble comfort where its inmates sure
In hope feel grateful in their lowly place
And here My Lady lighted oriel shines
A giant glowworm in the odorous gloom
Ah stands she smiling there in loose white gown
Hearing the music of her future drown
The stillness and hushed whispering of the vines
Whose lattice-clasping leaves o'ershade her room
Or kneels she worshipful beside her bed
In large-eyed hope and bended lowliness
To crave that He the Giver may impart
Enough of strength to bind her trembling heart
Steadfast and true and that her will be led
To own His chastening cares pain but to bless
Or sits she at her mirror face to face
With her own loveliness O blessed land
That owns such twin perfections both together
If guessed aright Ah me I wonder whether
She now her braided opulent hair unlace
And drop it billowing from her moonwhite hand
Then what a fount of wealth to lover sight
Her loosened hair I heard her mother say
When she is seated tumbles to the floor
And trails the length of her own foot and more
And dare I lapt in bliss dream my delight
Ere long shall watch its rippling softness play
Dare I O vanity but do I dare
Think she now looks upon the sorry rhyme
I wrote long ere that well-loved setting sun
What time love conquering dread My Lady won
While I unblessed adored in mute despair 
Even now I gave it her at parting time
At matin time where creepers interlace
We sauntered slowly for we loved the place
And talked of passing things I pleased to trace
Through leafy mimicry the true leaves made
The stateliness and beauty of her shade
A wavering of strange purples dimly seen
It gloomed the daisy light the kingcup sheen
And drank up sunshine from the vital green
That silent shadow moving on the grass
Struck me with terror it should ever pass
And be blank nothing in the coming years
Where in the dreadful shadow of my fears
Her shrouded form I saw through blurring tears
My Darling shrouded form in beauty bloom
Born with funereal sadness to her tomb
What idle dreaming I abruptly cried
My Lady turned half startled at my side
And looked inquiry I through shame or pride
Bantered the words as mockery of sense
Mere aimless freak of fostered indolence
She did not urge me gentle wise and kind
But clasped my hand and talked her beaming mind
Arrayed in brightness all it touched Behind
Her shadow fell forgot as she and I
Went homeward musing smiling at the sky
Thro' pastures and thro' fields where corn grew strong
By cottage nests that could not harbour wrong
Across the bridge where laughed the stream along
The road to where her gabled mansion stood
Old tall and spacious in a massy wood
We loitered toward the porch but paused meanwhile
Where Psyche holds a dial to beguile
The hours of sunshine by her golden smile
And holds it like a goblet brimmed with wine
Nigh clad in trails of tangled eglantine
In the deep peacefulness which shone around
My soul was soothed no darksome vision frowned
Before my sight while cast upon the ground
Where Psyche and My Lady shadows lay
Twin graces on the flower-edged gravel way
I then but yearned for Titian glorious power
That I by toiling one devoted hour
Might check the march of Time and leave a dower
Of rich delight that beauty I could see
For broadening generations yet to be
The wind that good for neither man nor beast
Weeks long incessant from the blighting East
Drove gloom and havoc through the land and ceased
When swaying mildly over wide Atlantic seas
Bland and dewy soft streamed the Western breeze
In walking forth I felt with vague alarm
Closer than wont her pressure on my arm
As through morn fragrant air we sought what harm
That Eastern wind despite had done the garden growth
Where much lay dead or languished low for drouth
Her own parterre was bounded by a red
Old buttressed wall of brick moss-broidered
Where grew mid pink and azure plots a bed
Of shining lilies intermixed in wondrous light
She called them Radiant spirits robed in white
Here the mad gale had rioted and thrown
Far drifts of snowy petals fiercely blown
The stalks in twisted heaps one flower alone
Yet hung and lit the waste the latest blossom born
Among its fallen kinsmen left forlorn
Thy pallid droop cried I but more than all
Thy lonely sweetness takes my soul in thrall
O Seraph Lily Blanch so stately tall
By violets adored regarded by the rose
Well loved by every gentle flower that blows
My Lady dovelike to the lily went
Took in curved palms a cup and forward leant
Deep draining to the gold its dreamy scent
I see her now pale beauty as she bending stands
The wind-worn blossom resting in her hands
Then slowly rising she in gazing trance
Affrayed long pored on vacancy A glance
Of chilly splendour tinged her countenance
And told the saddened truth that stress of blighting weather
Had made her lilies and My Lady droop together
What art thou whispering lowly to thy babe
O wan girl-mother with Madonna lids
Downcast Why pressest thou so close his pale
Geranium cheek to thy yet whiter breast
Ah doubtless sweet to feel him draw the stream
That fills with strength his lily limbs And laughs
Thine own heart with his deeply dimpled laughter
Answering straight thy dainty finger touch
And understandeth he that murmurous moan
Wherewith thou hushest patting him to rest
What visions charm thy gaze now resting wide
In settled sweet content Beholdest thou
Thy babe now sprung a man walk sunhazed slopes
With one lovelier than visions lovely as
The truth O Love when thou dost smile on me
Or seest thou him still greater grown in might
And stout of action marching on to reach
That changeful coloured flag whose waving crests
The glittering heights of fame for which men pant
Unmindful there what tempests rage and sweep
Alas what dream has made that watery veil
Hide thine eye light from mine even as a mist
Passing between me and a harvest moon
And whence this shadowy wall that baulks my gaze
Why fadest thou thyself in mist O Love
Whither hath fled thy babe and where art thou 
Where am I Is it life a dream or death
Ah me alas this crushing wretchedness
And I a vainer fool than one who yearns
Clutching at rainbows spanned across the sky
Ah hope diseased My spirit lured astray
By siren hope drifts hard by some dark fate
And hope alternating despair has mixed
My life so long with charnelled death that I
Can scarce resolve the present from my past
Nor what might once have been from what is now
Ah Dearest shall I never see thy face
Again not ever never any more
I know that fancy was but naught and one
Born of past hope I know thy earthly form
Is mouldering in its tomb but yet O Love
Thy spirit must dwell somewhere in this waste
Of worlds that fill the overwhelming heavens
With light and motion that could never die
And wilt thou not vouchsafe one beaming look
To ease a lonely heart that beats in pain
For loss of thee and only thee O Love
Or hast thou found in that pure life thou livest
My soul was an unworthy choice for thine
And therefore takest no count of its despair
And yet yea verily thy love was true
I would not wrong thee with another thought
I would not enter at the gates of heaven
By thinking else than that thy love was true
But I obtain no response to my cries
Making within my soul all void and cold
And comfortless Ay empty as this grate
Of life wherefrom the fire has well nigh fled
Leaving but chasmed ugliness and ruin
And weak as faltering of these taper flames
Half sunken in their sockets by whose gleam
I see though faintly where my books stand ranged
Most mute though sometime eloquent to me
And where my pictures hang with other forms
Instinct from what I know where friends portrayed
Like ghosts loom on me from another world
Then what remains but like a child worn out
With weeping that I sink me down to rest
To sleep not dream and if I could to die
Our world has spun ten circles round the light
Since here she vanished In my helpless gaze
To mark the spot was fixed this carven stone
Raw garish stolidly obtrusive then
Now harmonising kindly with the rest
A spray of centipedal ivy creeps
From death to birth and reaches to her name
With kisslike touch its tender leaflets feel
The letter edge I scarce can think it chance
Now scene by scene that strange old long-ago
Crowding my opened memory presents
Tumultuous as in dreams some dreadful state
Wherein I knew not falsehood from the truth
Where hope ascending struck the star of Love
Then fell down headlong grovelling in despair
But rose at length and walked the beaten way
So dim and far these things so worn and changed
I scarcely feel that I am he who sought
And won her love And is it true indeed
That I absorbed in tenderest intercourse
Of trustful glance and trustful clasping hands
With her went wandering by the river side
While over head melodious branches sang
Scattering the gold of sunset-dazzled flowers
Breathing their perfumed sweetness from our path
That flickering went to where in purple woods
The rugged church tower burned a wall of fire
Did I when silence awed the winter woods
And giant shadows trenched the frosty ground
From bole and limb whose vault held in the night
Love to behold the full-grown magic moon
Cast splendour glittering on the silver rime
Yes mid the notes and emerald flush of spring
With swollen brooks exulting through the fields
And rainy wind that in an ocean-roar
Bore down the forest tops the livelong day
Through straggling gleams through random wafts of shade
Rejoicingly I trod the glistening paths
Yes I it was in dreamy golden haze
Beheld poor men hard toiling all the hours
And thought them happier than the birds that sang
That sang and trilled in gurgles of delight
Dallying I loitered in the golden time
Long after the loved nightingale had ceased
To pour his passionate impulse over plains
Of shivering corn now ripened into wealth
When sunset-coloured fruit in orchard crofts
Hung slowly mellowing under azure noons
And hushed in darkened leaves the dreaming air
Swelled gently to a whispering sound and died
With joy I wandered on from knoll to knoll
And lost in marvel drank the lisping winds
The fairy winds that lisped me all was good
Nor marked I when the clogged horizon flew
In dusky vapour crowding up the skies
But woke anon when deathlike pallor thrown
From wrathful drift laid the whole land in gloom
When war enormous war broke through the heavens
In sheets and streaking fire and thunderous clap
With shock on shock that crushed the ripened corn
And swept the piled up midsummer to ruin
That wrenched great timbers of a thousand years
Shaking the strong foundations of the land
And when at last the terrible tempest fell
Wide heaven was emptied of the sun and stars
And void of more than all their light to me
Like fretted me to hollow weariness
When my sweet Dove of Paradise went off
Ascending glory-guarded into heaven
Then feeding on the past and fondling death
I grew in livid horror soon had grown
By foul self cankered to a charnel ghoule
Had not Almighty God gracious in love
Permitted her own presence once again
Mysterious as a vision yet once more
To come a shining warning and reveal
Athwart my path unfathomable gulfs
And kindle hope wherewith I still might gain
The hills that shine for ever to the blessed
Much striving has been mine since those events
Ruled the pulsation of my daily life
And now they are a vulgar chronicle
And gossiped over by the rudest tongues
A haunting song of old felicities
Lured me scarce consciously down here to muse
Upon my shattered dreams safe from the roar
Of interests in our grim metropolis
The beating heart of England and the world
Not seen by me since on that wondrous night
Her consolation came into my soul
Yet here again I stand beside her tomb 
And here I muse more wise and not so sad
Hers was a gracious and a gentle house
Rich in obliging nice observances
And famed ancestral hospitality
A cool repose lay grateful through the place
And pleasant duties promptly truly done
And every service moved by hidden springs
Sped with intelligence went smoothly round
The steward to that stately country home
Looked native there as lichen to the oak
He first held station chief in care and trust
That day which gave his baby mistress birth
And her he loved as father loves his own
Bearing her too that reverence which we feel
Toward those who born to loftier state than ours
Sit their high fortune with becoming grace
His love she ever sumptuously returned
In bounteous thankfulness for service done
How brightly twinkled then his shrewd grey eyes
And shone the roundness where his honest cheeks
Played to the rippling gladness of his mouth
In childhood rambles it was mostly he
She chose for partner spite of blandishment
And to her winsome ways he would forego
His pompous surveillance of wine and plate
To guard her lilting where the summer lay
On honeyed murmuring limes and under elms
August with knotted centuries of strength
And rooks sonorous in their shadowy heights
By thymy slopes foot-deep in sward they roved
Both lightly garrulous and she sweet child
Fusing her whole attention into joy
Until they stood before the lake that gleamed
With water-lilies sun and moving cloud
Then straight the flanking sedge and reeds remote
Gave clattering ducks and wild outlandish fowl
That tore in stormy scampering and splash
To snap with clamour at the crumbled bread
He had provided slyly bent on fun
The swans meanwhile majestic puffed and slow
Came proudly into action but alas
To small result for by mischance the spoil
Through dexterous skirmish fell to meaner bills
Our bread is all cast on the waters now
And well I'd like to know how many days
It must bide there before 'tis found again 
Some fool dull joke repeated good man he
Unversed in deep text comment never dreamed
What time its Abyssinian mountain roots
Swollen by fresh torrents mixed in Nubian lands
And thundered down from rocky ledge to ledge
How sacred Nilus flooding bank and plain
Transformed old Egypt to a shining sea
And slaves in swarthy crowds despised as dirt
Paddled upon the water scattering corn
While swam to their sad eyes a raking glance
Of temple sphinxes palms and pyramids
Faint sacrificial fire with dismal cries
And small hard masters armed with blooded thongs
Jocose and fierce scourged out their utmost toil
Long ages ere man heard this promised hope
But the dear child his vacant prattle heard
In wonder and believed it lore profound
And ever after when in solemn church
The very church I have before me now
Or household prayer these words were touched upon
Pert visions would intrude of gabbling fowls
Mid splashing water sedge and lily stars
In wending home he filled her lap with flowers
And she ere yet the house was reached unloosed
His guarding hand ran forward glinted through
The porch and with a joyous outcry lit
The room where sat in converse or at books
Her parents then as she an hour before
Had seen those mirrored marvels of the lake
All trembling merge to one confused turmoil
Of beauty broken into shattered light
When o'er its surface swept the hungry fowls
So blurred with shifting catches so involved
Through eagerness her babbled narrative
To the kind mother who embracing her
Felt satisfied her child had been well pleased
Then the great father he would lightly lift
To knee his darling girl with fingers cup
The tiny chin and kiss the rosebud mouth
And gently his large tawny hand would stroke
That woven sunshine glowing down her back
Which changed to deepest auburn glossed with gold
Calling her tricksy names But when at length
Appeared the calm inevitable nurse
He laughed and she in screaming laughter flew
By stalwart arm thrust high above his head
Immeshed in wild flowers emptied from her lap
Which shaking off he brought the screamer down
And gaily swung her into willing arms
She talked these childhood memories while we strolled
Among the scenes which bred them for she loved
To dwell on things which some regard as slight
But in her presence told by her own self
With clear apt words and satisfying voice
The violet poise of her most graceful head
Flung forth in lighted gesture to reveal
The very fact her hovering white hand
Almost in music warbling with her words
And bounding all the tenderest care to please 
Now one by one these aits of memory glow
In hallowed splendour and have made less dark
A life I feel not altogether vain
So common was her mother lot that who
Can say Like is not mine is blessed indeed
For they are countless that on shades have thrown
Their passion had been chilled for evermore
Scarce at her bloom and years before she met
The destined man her husband girl-like she
Adored a youth with sparkling genius graced
Who bound on great adventure spread all sail
But needed ballast working common sense
And meeting storms he foundered and was lost
For long his fate dragged at her heart it drained
Her strength it left her vague and desolate
Her life became as chill uneasy dreams
Wherefrom we cannot break Yet be it said
Lowly and truly gentle were her ways
She was a tender and obedient wife
And in a sweet and plaintive graciousness
Her every act performed I trust her mind
Subdued by constant sadness unavowed
Grew clear of shadows and at last could dwell
Upon the future that in one straight path
Reached Justice throned in everlasting light
And learned to feel that chastisement is love
Somewhat through lethargy and partly sense
Of duty in forgetfulness of grief
With pleadings due to her own kindliness
She came to take another as her lord
Then came to yield herself in all and wed
Her husband own indomitable will
He having gained her cherished her and loved
Her mild compliance with the strength of life
He was a man of thews and goodly frame
Made swart in battle Under Indian suns
Our foes had often there been taught to know
That weight of arm resistless when he closed
Charging upon them with his sword and eye
But when his father died he left the East
For England here to rule his own estate
And reign among the county gentlemen
Who duly came with pride to own him chief
He had the kingly look of born command
An eagle set of eye and curve of neck
A cutting insight backed by solid sense
Vast knowledge and the facile use of it
To break obstruction or direct the force
Of will resolved to compass every end
Withal a broad and generous natured man
Who ever kindly turned the doubtful scale
Against himself no tenant ever mourned
The day when the new master came to rule
Nor were old village gossips heard lament
The good times fled with their departed lord
Culture went hand in hand with strength in him
Broad-versed was he in science rock and soil
Plant shell bird beast to complex form of man
With something of the stars Historic works
He mostly read and ofttimes dug for trace
Of steps long past in archaeology
He loved the singers of our native land
Who take our souls up to the worth of life
And those deep thinkers whose conclusions show
The secret principles that work the world
He prized laborious Hallam but declared
Carlyle half mad A coil of restive thoughts
That touch on nothing sound or practical
Told in outrageous jargon cumbersome
As any Laplander costume Which I
In ruffled pride would always straight oppose
Sound or unsound his word is daylight truth
That breeding heroes once was England boast
And now we brag of making millionaires
Your 'practical' means shortest cut to wealth
But far too frequently purse robs the heart
One growing heavy drains the other dry
His style poetically pregnant oft
By note of admiration merely hints
More than crammed Pro Con of your favourite page
At this he shouts a scornful roaring laugh
The table shaking and the vessels chinked
As fell his weighty arm with massive gaze
In hurly-burly sort he bantered me
Young bubble-dreamer plotting stanza rhymes
What can you know of laws what know of plans
Which bound these varied interests of ours
Through crossing currents fixed for certain ends
To frame this state we call society
The full outcome of immemorial time
Know here on earth wealth must not be despised
For we are as we are While men subsist
By interchanging goods and service gold
Will be the grease that smooths the whole machine
I grant a few the greatest live content
To give forth what has ripened in their minds
But greed alone brings each result to grow
And spread its uses through the mass Beside
Where honour reason or instinctive life
Quite fails there gold will prick the sluggard loon
It wakes the drowsy lounger of the East
Who lolls in sunshine idle as a gourd
To toil like Irish hodmen Roused he hears
Coin ringing lively music falls to work
And digs and hews and grinds he sees not far
Himself a chief of horsemen richly clad
Armed with long spears and silver-halted blades
Seizing pachalic power by a swift blow
But labour having brought him gold brings fears
The weight of wealth has made his footfall staid
He longs for order settled government
And stands a stern upholder by the law
I know you flout this 'gold materialism
For what you call the 'gold of evening skies
But let me tell you boy for you 'tis well
My lands are broad and bankers true or else
Your maiden she poor girl I often think
Would want a crust to eat and shoes to wear
Thus he in what I call his 'copper-gilt
For which I paid him tinsel She want shoes
Her feet will press the flowers of paradise
And being angel she will need no food
Eugh Get your tackle let us catch some trout
She never stayed a long while from her home
But lived a quiet life contentedly
Taking the continent and many things
On trust feeling our landscapes satisfied
Her love for scenes When from a visit she
Returned no lovelier picture ever blessed
My sight than when she swam into his arms
And stood in beauty frail against his strength
Supporting her and kissed his lips and cheeks
And brow He then as if his daughter yet
Were but a child would press the upturned head
Between his hands where peered the innocent face
Rosy with smile and blush like a sweet flower
Bursting its tawny sheath whereon he gazed
A father gaze immeasurably kind
And long in tenderness akin to pity
There held her who was beautiful and good
One eve full late in balmy summer time
We feared the wind breathing of night had chilled
Her tranquil mother as we paced a walk
Leading espalier-trellised to the house
She ever heedful parted silently
And flushed with sunset vanished from our gaze
But we beheld her soon dawn from the porch
In haste bringing her mother mantle When
As comes the tide-wave up an easy beach
Played with a billowy sound and look of foam
The thousand folds round her advancing feet
Her shape divine looking as great as ocean's
Light beyond yet no sea bird that gleams
From the blue-arched illimitable heaven
Could glide with lightness airier than she
To hang the garment round her mother neck
And then strike womanlike the folds in place
Kissing the thankful lips and deftly fix
The fastening at her throat While pondering thus
And patching these rich fragments strange it seems
What little things obtrude on my regard
I now remember every sculptured group
And painted scene and portrait figured vase
Each print unique and gem we once beheld
When visiting a mansion near enriched
By generations of collected Art
The masters by whose hands the works were wrought
Long mouldered into dust Ah well I know
Why some have burned their symbols in my brain
And rise before me now Stone-bound Narcissus
Droops melting in himself and Echo by
In shrunk despair hangs envying what he wastes
Through smouldering morning mists a glorious sun
The mountain-shoulder burns above transmutes
The zenith cloudlets into airy gold
And deep down seen through pure crystalline blue
Glimmer the village lake and mountain range
Superb at ease a Lady stands and smiles
Sweet welcome to the world though centuries
Have lapsed since she approved her painter work
Her smile has such sincerity all feel
They must have known her some time in their lives
Here bossed on silver vase a marriage train
Moves round to music lookers-on cast flowers
Before the timid bending bride meanwhile
Stalwart and proud her bridegroom smiles abroad
As at a dazzling sun the pipers blow
The harpers twang the cymbals clash youths sing
Six maidens walk behind to hold her veil
One pair are sad the next look vain and two
Prettily whisper secrets to themselves
Here from old paper stands and looks of men
The manliest and king of English kings
The lion Cromwell in his dress of war
Beneath him coils a monster welling blood
Whose severed heads stretch round in scattered gleam
Of mitre jewelled coronet and crown
Sharp cut on gem set in a thick gold ring
The size and roundness of a lady nail
Love bleeding on the dart himself doth point
Who thus had died had not with tenderest touch
Immortal Psyche held the anguished heart
Fast to her own and purified the pain
And fanned him with her wings And now as then
Along those hushed rich corridors we moved
Poring each masterpiece we favoured most
And would no longer stay but felt some chance
Must serve us for the rest musing I pass
From scene to scene of My Dear Lady life
And leave my other memories undisturbed
Beneath this airy sapphire brooding rest
Its shadows overcast me with a chill
Like coming storm that black calamity
Which struck and took our Darling from their charge
And mine Grief stupefied us all At once
The childless mother lost her wavering strength
And lay prostrated never tasting life
On earth again Beside her husband sat
And watched her fading saw the last poor smile
Wane from her features till the closing eyes
Lit into tearful rapture when he knew
Love immortality to her revealed
With both her own she mutely clasped his hand
And held it in most gentle pressures fixed
But when the tender grasp relaxed and fell
The world closed round him to a stony blank
And now was stricken down the mighty man
As the ripe harvest levelled by a storm
At morningtide which ere sun warmth anew
Can flatter into strength a second storm
O'erwhelms and scattereth to waste at even
When that torpidity which follows pain
Through strangeness passed to natural regard
For daily wants his vacant home he loathed
His spacious garden grounds his lake his woods
The breezy air the overhanging heaven
He loathed he loathed them all When spring aroused
The amorous songsters of the copse and field
To seasonable joy their music mocked
His sadness with its echoes babbling tales
Of what had been and he in bitterness
Resolved to quit a place where every turn
Stood like a foe whose settled leering eye
In silence gloared with hope to mark his fall
He left our country Far in Eastern climes
His nation serving well he fought and died
And never had a nobler man upheld
The majesty of England worth and name
Long toil-devoted years have gloomed and shone
Since these events closed up my doors of life
Partly from choice and part necessity
With constancy have I sustained and urged
The work it was my duty to advance
For when my vision cleared again I looked
And saw how mean a thing was man who used
The produce of his fellows' energies
And gave back nothing Then my spirit saw
This Island race two thousand years ago
In simple savagery controlled by priests
More fell and bloody than the wolves that howled
At midnight round their monstrous altar-stones
Scenting the sacrificial human blood
Saw girt with legions lynx-eyed Caesar come
To taste of Briton valour When appeared
Legions succeeding legions and the swarms
Marshalled by skilful discipline had fallen
To tributaries of all-conquering Rome
Saw when Rome grip through fierce luxurious guilt
Could hold no longer and with tattered plume
Her eagles left her slaves to stem or tide
The hungry Pict incursions as they could
Next when a burly genial race here raised
The White Horse Standard men who wrought the soil
Till yellow corn responsive sunned the plains
When lured by booty Ravens from the North
Bent hitherward stiffly the contest tugged
Long years till both the wearied champions joined
Their hands as common home to share the Isle
With peace the land grew fat and wholesome bonds
Of nobles to their kings and serfs to them
Fell slackened or distorted to misrule
When Norman William hard as rocks and fierce
As fire with charge of mailed horse and showers
Of steel won England Her rough sons he drilled
Grimly by stern command and strength of sword
He forced obedience where he fixed a law
For ages long against men stubborn minds
With give and take the bold Plantagenets
Kept up the drill At length the race now grown
By constant wrestle into thews of power
Moved calm with strength beneath the Tudor sway
And then a Northern Stuart wore their crown
Whose son unmindful he was over men
Truth-lovers lied to them and lost his head
For Puritans held no respect for lies
Next flared Charles Satyr saturnalia
Of Lely Nymphs who panting sang More gold
We yield our beauties freely gold more gold
Hapless explosions folly frenzied plots
Till well coerced by Lowland William craft
Then plans that led to nought or worse enforced
By Marlborough cannon thundering over-seas
Then through the Guelphic line our race now grows
To that great power which is to sway the world
Down from those human shambles wolf-belapt
To when in pardonably grand excess
Of pity through our people will was bought
Free indolence for Isles of Western slaves
And now when thousands blandly would deny
The proven murderer his rope the thief
Due chastisement and when a General
May blunder troops to death yea and receive
His Senate vote of thanks and all made smooth
And when as much from universal trust
In other states' goodwill as from the pinch
Of blinking parsimony we our fleets
Let rot and regiments shrink to skeletons 
From those fell rights to such urbanity
The march indeed is long tho' kindly freaks
May sometimes clamour Justice from her throne
Yet gentleness is still a noble gain
And we will trust such freaks are nobly meant
To touch the power we hold what work has been
Of vigorous brawn and keen contriving brains
Stout men with mighty battle in their limbs
Thinkers whose cunning struck beyond the strength
Of hosts priests sworn to God whose daily lives
Preached gospel purity and kindliness
Wise chroniclers whose patience garnered facts
For present want and food for coming time
And dames who made their homes a paradise
And kept their husbands great have greatly given
The light and choicest substance of their lives
For generations mingling each with each
Wave multitudinously urging wave
Toward the one great broadening flow of things
Then passed into the gloom that swallows all
Could I dwell here in our proud Island Home
Preserved by countless victories made strong
By kings and kingly councillors enriched
By artisans whose skill surpassed all men's
And by such wondrous song immortalised
It glorifies mankind could I dwell here
Here feed on this accumulated wealth
Like senseless swine on acorns of the wood
And own no wish to render thanks in kind
Surely there could be found some waste wild flower
To yield one honey-drop that I might drain
To swell the general hive At last resolved
Out to its utmost spray my force should strive
And bring to fruit its yet unopened buds
I craving gracious aid of Heaven straightway
Began the work which shall be mine till death
If it be granted me that I disroot
Some evil weeds or plant a seed which time
Shall nourish to a tree of pleasant shade
To wearied limbs a boon and fair to view
I then shall know the Hand that struck me down
Has been my guide into the paths of truth
And She my lost adored One where is She
Where has She been throughout these dragging years
Of labour She has been my light of life
The lustrous dawn and radiance of the day
At noon and She has burned the colours in
To richer depth across the sun at setting
And my tired lids She closes then in dreams
Descends a shaft of glory barred with stairs
And leads my spirit up where I behold
My dear ones lost And thus through sleep not death
Remote from earthly cares and vexing jars
I taste the stillness of the life to come
What time his scythe in misty summer morns
With cheery ring the mower whets and kine
Move slowly breathing sweetness toward the pail
Their milking-maid is jingling as she calls
Hi Strawberry and Blossom hither Cows
While slung against the upland with his team
The ploughman dimly like a phantom glides
What time that noisy spot of life the lark
Climbs shrill with ecstasy the trembling air
And Cuckoo Cuckoo baffling whence it comes
Shouts the blithe egotist who cries himself
And every hedge and coppice sings What time
The lover restless through his waking dream
Nigh wins the hoped-for great unknown delight
Which never comes to flower maybe elsewhere
The worshipped Maid a folded rose o'er-rosed
By rosy dawn asleep lies breathing smiles
Then ofttime through the emptied London streets
When every house is closed and spectral still
And save the sparrow chirping from the tower
Where tolls the passing time all sounds are hushed
Then walk I pondering on the ways of fate
And file the past before me in review
Counting my losses and my treasured gains
And feel I lost a glory such as man
Can never know but once but how there sprung
From out the chastening wear of grief a scope
Of sobered interest bent on vaster ends
Than hitherto were mine and sympathy
For struggling souls that each held dear within
A sacred meaning known or unrevealed 
And these in their complexities and far
Relations with the sum of general power
Which is the living world now are my gain
And grant my spirit from this widened truth
A glimpse of that high duty claimed of all
How wildly flares the West about the sun
Now fallen low And as one nameless sails
Lost deep in witching reverie along
A silent river passing villages
Busy with toil flowered banks and shadowy coves
And cattle browsing peaceful in the meads
Who only wakes to consciousness when full
A burst of sunshine from the sinking orb
Smiting the flood first strikes his dazzled sight 
So to the present hour am I recalled
By yon red sun-light flaming up the spire
And vane that sparkles in the warm blue heaven
And that too-well-remembered tolling bell
Now on the broad mysterious ocean leans
The sailor o'er his vessel side and feels
The buzzing joys of home wondering if fate
Will bear him on to end his being there
Now pleased the housewife down the path descries
Her husband footsteps hitherward his meal
Prepared the children each made tidy she
With smiling comfort means to soothe her man
By labour wearied through the evening hours
They whirl their life web humming like a wheel
These airy insects Birds have ceased to sing
But twitter faintly settling to their rest
And not a rook caw rends the placid air
I must begone but ere I go will kneel
To kiss this ivy modest earthly type
That would with constant verdure grace her name
As I enshroud her memory with my love
For She has been the blessing that has nerved
My strength in failing hours of blackest night
When doubts oppress and fears distract and when
Gigantic Evil hoofs are crushing good
And pity burns in terror while appalled
Blanched Justice shrinks aloof and not a voice
The smallest dares uplift itself against
The dripping blood-red horror which pollutes
With death and danger heaven and earth and sea
When men belief grows wild seeing alone
The dreadful black abominable sin
Forgetful that the light still shines beyond
And doubting last the very truth of God
They hate their fellow creatures and themselves
Groaning beneath a Despot who thinks less
Of precious human blood than shipwrights count
Of water in the dock so many feet
Will bear so many tons if it but aid
One little step his brutalising aims
Who as an armed thief sacks his people wealth
Then shines my Love star-brightness thro' the gloom
And comes as comes a glorious Conqueror
Returning from that Despot overthrow
His brow yet flashed and pale with victory
Whose prowess long withstood the charging shocks
Of hosts that swarmed who baffling with his skill
Their cunning combinations in good time
Closed his own force and wrought them utmost woe
Smashed the huge liners of the hostile fleet
Their swiftest frigates sank to watery hell
Others he scared like fowls and trailed the rest
In foamed victorious wake a captured prize
Where thronged his people stand in proud acclaim
Of Welcome Welcome Welcome To our hearts
O Saviour of thy country to our hearts
O Father of thy people welcome back
And shout in exultation his dear name
Who moves through storms of music and beholds
Gay seas of faces tossed with happiness
And lit through rapture into wondering awe
And as that grateful multitude forgets
Whatever wrong he may have done do I
My scathing sorrow and embrace the good
And when in after years that honoured One
Returns at last unto his native land
From having wrought his last great victory
A solemn corpse in state his people close
Solemnly to do honour to the dead
And stand in silence mid the mournful sway
Of martial music wailing he is gone
Who saved them from the shackles they abhorred
And in all reverence with tenderest hands
And tearful eyes and hearts that burn and throb
They lower their consecrated Hero down
Down sinking slowly to his lasting rest
Whose glory rises to a settled star
Lighting the land he loved for evermore
So comes my love to me its glorious light
Yet hovers sacredly and guides me on
To grander prospects and more noble use
Of powers entrusted me Henceforth my soul
Will never lack a spot whither to flee
When crowding evils war to shake my faith
In righteousness for thinking of Her life
Made up of gracious act and sweet regard
Compassionately tender and enshrined
In such a form that oft to my fond eyes
She seemed divine I scarcely can withhold
My wonder Heaven could spare Her to a world
So stained as ours And now whatever come
Of wrong and bitterness to break my strength
Whatever darkness may be mine to know
A ray has pierced me from the highest heaven 
I have believed in worth and do believe
Sweet is the moisture of the trellis-rose
Dripping in music down through glistening leaves
And sweeter still its fragrance that we breathe
On throwing wide our lattice to the morn
Sweet to see thrushes bright-eyed speckle-bosomed
Search dew-grey lawns with keen inspective glance
And rabbits nimbly nibble tender grasses
Or pause when startled at each other shade
And when the orchard boughs bend low with fruit
With joy we watch the mounded harvest wains
Glide amid singing hedgerows smoothly by
'Tis fair to watch hung pale in milky azure
Mist slowly closing into wandering cloud
Driven by the clean and light elastic wind
And through that lone harmonious sunshine hum
Of unseen life mark how the floating seeds
Pass like flown fancies out beyond regard
But sweeter than all roses sights of birds
Richer than fruit more than whole lands of corn
Fairer than glories of the brightest day
Dearer than any old familiar sound
Of childhood hours than every glittering joy
Thrown from the teeming fountain of the earth
Is our impulsive answer to the call
Of Duty
They who would be something more
Than they who feast and laugh and die will hear
The voice of Duty as the note of war
Nerving their spirits to great enterprise
And knitting every sinew for the charge
It makes them quit a happy silvan life
For contest in the roaring capital
And in its ever-widening roar stand firm
And fixed amid the thunder foot to foot
With opposition smiting for the truth
To such the rage of battle charms beyond
The heaviest ocean-plunges dashed on cliffs
The tempest fury on the grinding woods
Or elemental crashing in the heavens
Beyond a lover gladness when he feels
His maiden bosom throbbing tremulously
Beyond a father when he feels in hand
The rounded warmth of little firstborn limb
Or in beholding him grown tall and strong
And their delight will never wane but wax
In greatness with the roll of time and burn
More brightly fed with noble deeds For souls
Obedient to divine impulse who urge
Their force in steadfastness until the rocks
Be hewn of their obstruction till the swamp's
Insatiability be choked and bound
A hardened road for traffic and disport
Tall giant arches stride across the flood
Till tortured earth release its mysteries
Which straight become slaves pliant unto man
Till labours at the desk at length result
In law who pondering on the stars proclaim
Their size and distance and pursue their course
Who work whatever will give greater power
Or profit man with leisure to observe
The wondrous heavens and loveliness of earth
Who will instruct him in the truth whereby
He learns to reverence more his fellow man
Who point his spirit to the worshipping
Imperishable things from which he comes
To scorn the fluttering vanities of wealth
As poisoned sweets and baubles should they dim
His eyes one instant to that awful light
Wherein he moves who do and who have done
All that has ever aided man to free
Himself imperfectly from grosser self
And made his seeing pure such souls sublime
Will never want for blessed joy in work
Working for Duty which can never die
Men may seem playthings of ironic fate
One stoutly shod paces a velvet sward
And one is forced with naked feet to climb
Sharp slaty ways alive with scorpions
While wolfish hunger strains to catch his throat
One lingers o'er his purple draught and laughs
One shuddering tastes his bitter cup and groans
But there is hope for all Though not for all
To sail through sunny ripples to the end
Chatting of shipwrecks as pathetic tales
All are not born to nurse the dainty pangs
That herald love completion and behold
Their darlings flourish in the tempered air
Of comfort till themselves become the springs
Of a yet milder race all are not born
To touch majestic eminence and shine
Directing spirits in their nations' sight
And radiate unformed posterity
But through transcendent mercy all are born
To enter on a nobler heritage
Than these if each but wills to choose aright
In serving Duty man prerogative
Which is far pleasanter than paths of flowers
Than warmest clustering of household joys
And prouder than the proudest shouts of fame
That follow action not in conscience wrought
Fair Duty most unlike the blight of death
Whose dismal presence levels men to ruin
Lifts up his nature into rarer life
Hers is a broad estate open to poor
And rich alike here rudest peasant may
Move as their equal with baronial lords
And those who serve be great as those who rule
Here a smirched artisan who merely bolts
The plates of iron fortress breathes the pride
Of that trained chieftain who commands its guns
And one that points or fires a single piece
Claims honour with the mind who planned the war
Fair Duty hard and perilous to serve
Exacts devotion that is absolute
Ere she reveal the heaven of her smile
And gnaws with misery the traitor slave
Who having known her countenance and moved
At her behest relapses into sloth
Or drudges serf to his own base desires 
Sworn knight and armed with mail and sword of proof
But coaxing brutish ignorance with praise
And with the wasted hearts of honest men
Gorging the monster he went forth to slay
But whoso faithfully reveres her law
As primal and of every want supreme
Making edged danger discipline his strength
That changes hindrance into past delight
Fair Duty dowers with her celestial love
From which the mystic blessing glory grows
And glory born of Duty is a crown
Of light And all thus crowned illume their work
In splendour that no earthly eye may pierce
And know that every seed they set and stone
They fix and truth they reach unite to found
A well-planned city in a governed land
That rising babes high a Temple built
Firm in its centre to the praise of God
And each beholds his labours glorified
Alike the toiler at the desk a king
Upon his throne or builder of the bridge
The desk in lustre shines a kingly throne
The throne diffuses radiance like a sun
The bridge spans death a pathway to the stars
Pauline mine own bend o'er me thy soft breast
Shall pant to mine bend o'er me thy sweet eyes
And loosened hair and breathing lips and arms
Drawing me to thee these build up a screen
To shut me in with thee and from all fear
So that I might unlock the sleepless brood
Of fancies from my soul their lurking-place
Nor doubt that each would pass ne'er to return
To one so watched so loved and so secured
But what can guard thee but thy naked love
Ah dearest whoso sucks a poisoned wound
Envenoms his own veins Thou art so good
So calm if thou shouldst wear a brow less light
For some wild thought which but for me were kept
From out thy soul as from a sacred star
Yet till I have unlocked them it were vain
To hope to sing some woe would light on me
Nature would point at one whose quivering lip
Was bathed in her enchantments whose brow burned
Beneath the crown to which her secrets knelt
Who learned the spell which can call up the dead
And then departed smiling like a fiend
Who has deceived God if such one should seek
Again her altars and stand robed and crowned
Amid the faithful Sad confession first
Remorse and pardon and old claims renewed
Ere I can be as I shall be no more
I had been spared this shame if I had sat
By thee forever from the first in place
Of my wild dreams of beauty and of good
Or with them as an earnest of their truth
No thought nor hope having been shut from thee
No vague wish unexplained no wandering aim
Sent back to bind on fancy wings and seek
Some strange fair world where it might be a law
But doubting nothing had been led by thee
Through youth and saved as one at length awaked
Who has slept through a peril Ah vain vain
Thou lovest me the past is in its grave
Though its ghost haunts us still this much is ours
To cast away restraint lest a worse thing
Wait for us in the dark Thou lovest me
And thou art to receive not love but faith
For which thou wilt be mine and smile and take
All shapes and shames and veil without a fear
That form which music follows like a slave
And I look to thee and I trust in thee
As in a Northern night one looks alway
Unto the East for morn and spring and joy
Thou seest then my aimless hopeless state
And resting on some few old feelings won
Back by thy beauty wouldst that I essay
The task which was to me what now thou art
And why should I conceal one weakness more
Thou wilt remember one warm morn when winter
Crept aged from the earth and spring first breath
Blew soft from the moist hills the black-thorn boughs
So dark in the bare wood when glistening
In the sunshine were white with coming buds
Like the bright side of a sorrow and the banks
Had violets opening from sleep like eyes
I walked with thee who knew'st not a deep shame
Lurked beneath smiles and careless words which sought
To hide it till they wandered and were mute
As we stood listening on a sunny mound
To the wind murmuring in the damp copse
Like heavy breathings of some hidden thing
Betrayed by sleep until the feeling rushed
That I was low indeed yet not so low
As to endure the calmness of thine eyes
And so I told thee all while the cool breast
I leaned on altered not its quiet beating
And long ere words like a hurt bird complaint
Bade me look up and be what I had been
I felt despair could never live by thee
Thou wilt remember Thou art not more dear
Than song was once to me and I ne'er sung
But as one entering bright halls where all
Will rise and shout for him sure I must own
That I am fallen having chosen gifts
Distinct from theirs that I am sad and fain
Would give up all to be but where I was
Not high as I had been if faithful found
But low and weak yet full of hope and sure
Of goodness as of life that I would lose
All this gay mastery of mind to sit
Once more with them trusting in truth and love
And with an aim not being what I am
O Pauline I am ruined who believed
That though my soul had floated from its sphere
Of wild dominion into the dim orb
Of self that it was strong and free as ever
It has conformed itself to that dim orb
Reflecting all its shades and shapes and now
Must stay where it alone can be adored
I have felt this in dreams in dreams in which
I seemed the fate from which I fled I felt
A strange delight in causing my decay
I was a fiend in darkness chained forever
Within some ocean-cave and ages rolled
Till through the cleft rock like a moonbeam came
A white swan to remain with me and ages
Rolled yet I tired not of my first free joy
In gazing on the peace of its pure wings
And then I said It is most fair to me
Yet its soft wings must sure have suffered change
From the thick darkness sure its eyes are dim
Its silver pinions must be cramped and numbed
With sleeping ages here it cannot leave me
For it would seem in light beside its kind
Withered though here to me most beautiful
And then I was a young witch whose blue eyes
As she stood naked by the river springs
Drew down a god I watched his radiant form
Growing less radiant and it gladdened me
Till one morn as he sat in the sunshine
Upon my knees singing to me of heaven
He turned to look at me ere I could lose
The grin with which I viewed his perishing
And he shrieked and departed and sat long
By his deserted throne but sunk at last
Murmuring as I kissed his lips and curled
Around him I am still a god to thee
Still I can lay my soul bare in its fall
Since all the wandering and all the weakness
Will be a saddest comment on the song
And if that done I can be young again
I will give up all gained as willingly
As one gives up a charm which shuts him out
From hope or part or care in human kind
As life wanes all its care and strife and toil
Seem strangely valueless while the old trees
Which grew by our youth home the waving mass
Of climbing plants heavy with bloom and dew
The morning swallows with their songs like words
All these seem clear and only worth our thoughts
So aught connected with my early life
My rude songs or my wild imaginings
How I look on them most distinct amid
The fever and the stir of after years
I ne'er had ventured e'en to hope for this
Had not the glow I felt at His award
Assured me all was not extinct within
His whom all honor whose renown springs up
Like sunlight which will visit all the world
So that e'en they who sneered at him at first
Come out to it as some dark spider crawls
From his foul nets which some lit torch invades
Yet spinning still new films for his retreat
Thou didst smile poet but can we forgive
Sun-treader life and light be thine forever
Thou art gone from us years go by and spring
Gladdens and the young earth is beautiful
Yet thy songs come not other bards arise
But none like thee they stand thy majesties
Like mighty works which tell some spirit there
Hath sat regardless of neglect and scorn
Till its long task completed it hath risen
And left us never to return and all
Rush in to peer and praise when all in vain
The air seems bright with thy past presence yet
But thou art still for me as thou hast been
When I have stood with thee as on a throne
With all thy dim creations gathered round
Like mountains and I felt of mould like them
And with them creatures of my own were mixed
Like things half-lived catching and giving life
But thou art still for me who have adored
Though single panting but to hear thy name
Which I believed a spell to me alone
Scarce deeming thou wast as a star to men
As one should worship long a sacred spring
Scarce worth a moth flitting which long grasses cross
And one small tree embowers droopingly 
Joying to see some wandering insect won
To live in its few rushes or some locust
To pasture on its boughs or some wild bird
Stoop for its freshness from the trackless air
And then should find it but the fountain-head
Long lost of some great river washing towns
And towers and seeing old woods which will live
But by its banks untrod of human foot
Which when the great sun sinks lie quivering
In light as some thing lieth half of life
Before God foot waiting a wondrous change
Then girt with rocks which seek to turn or stay
Its course in vain for it does ever spread
Like a sea arm as it goes rolling on
Being the pulse of some great country so
Wast thou to me and art thou to the world
And I perchance half feel a strange regret
That I am not what I have been to thee
Like a girl one has silently loved long
In her first loneliness in some retreat
When late emerged all gaze and glow to view
Her fresh eyes and soft hair and lips which bloom
Like a mountain berry doubtless it is sweet
To see her thus adored but there have been
Moments when all the world was in our praise
Sweeter than any pride of after hours
Yet sun-treader all hail From my heart heart
I bid thee hail E'en in my wildest dreams
I proudly feel I would have thrown to dust
The wreaths of fame which seemed o'erhanging me
To see thee for a moment as thou art
And if thou livest if thou lovest spirit
Remember me who set this final seal
To wandering thought that one so pure as thou
Could never die Remember me who flung
All honor from my soul yet paused and said
There is one spark of love remaining yet
For I have naught in common with him shapes
Which followed him avoid me and foul forms
Seek me which ne'er could fasten on his mind
And though I feel how low I am to him
Yet I aim not even to catch a tone
Of harmonies he called profusely up
So one gleam still remains although the last
Remember me who praise thee e'en with tears
For never more shall I walk calm with thee
Thy sweet imaginings are as an air
A melody some wondrous singer sings
Which though it haunt men oft in the still eve
They dream not to essay yet it no less
But more is honored I was thine in shame
And now when all thy proud renown is out
I am a watcher whose eyes have grown dim
With looking for some star which breaks on him
Altered and worn and weak and full of tears
Autumn has come like spring returned to us
Won from her girlishness like one returned
A friend that was a lover nor forgets
The first warm love but full of sober thoughts
Of fading years whose soft mouth quivers yet
With the old smile but yet so changed and still
And here am I the scoffer who have probed
Life vanity won by a word again
Into my own life by one little word
Of this sweet friend who lives in loving me
Lives strangely on my thoughts and looks and words
As fathoms down some nameless ocean thing
Its silent course of quietness and joy
O dearest if indeed I tell the past
May'st thou forget it as a sad sick dream
Or if it linger my lost soul too soon
Sinks to itself and whispers we shall be
But closer linked two creatures whom the earth
Bears singly with strange feelings unrevealed
Save to each other or two lonely things
Created by some power whose reign is done
Having no part in God or his bright world
I am to sing whilst ebbing day dies soft
As a lean scholar dies worn o'er his book
And in the heaven stars steal out one by one
As hunted men steal to their mountain watch
I must not think lest this new impulse die
In which I trust I have no confidence
So I will sing on fast as fancies come
Rudely the verse being as the mood it paints
I strip my mind bare whose first elements
I shall unveil not as they struggle forth
In infancy nor as they now exist
When I am grown above them and can rule 
But in that middle stage when they were full
Yet ere I had disposed them to my will
And then I shall show how these elements
Produced my present state and what it is
I am made up of an intensest life
Of a most clear idea of consciousness
Of self distinct from all its qualities
From all affections passions feelings powers
And thus far it exists if tracked in all
But linked in me to self-supremacy
Existing as a centre to all things
Most potent to create and rule and call
Upon all things to minister to it
And to a principle of restlessness
Which would be all have see know taste feel all 
This is myself and I should thus have been
Though gifted lower than the meanest soul
And of my powers one springs up to save
From utter death a soul with such desire
Confined to clay of powers the only one
Which marks me an imagination which
Has been a very angel coming not
In fitful visions but beside me ever
And never failing me so though my mind
Forgets not not a shred of life forgets
Yet I can take a secret pride in calling
The dark past up to quell it regally
A mind like this must dissipate itself
But I have always had one lode-star now
As I look back I see that I have halted
Or hastened as I looked towards that star 
A need a trust a yearning after God
A feeling I have analyzed but late
But it existed and was reconciled
With a neglect of all I deemed his laws
Which yet when seen in others I abhorred
I felt as one beloved and so shut in
From fear and thence I date my trust in signs
And omens for I saw God everywhere
And I can only lay it to the fruit
Of a sad after-time that I could doubt
Even his being e'en the while I felt
His presence never acted from myself
Still trusted in a hand to lead me through
All danger and this feeling ever fought
Against my weakest reason and resolve
And I can love nothing and this dull truth
Has come the last but sense supplies a love
Encircling me and mingling with my life
These make myself I have long sought in vain
To trace how they were formed by circumstance
Yet ever found them mould my wildest youth
Where they alone displayed themselves converted
All objects to their use now see their course
They came to me in my first dawn of life
Which passed alone with wisest ancient books
All halo-girt with fancies of my own
And I myself went with the tale a god
Wandering after beauty or a giant
Standing vast in the sunset an old hunter
Talking with gods or a high-crested chief
Sailing with troops of friends to Tenedos
I tell you naught has ever been so clear
As the place the time the fashion of those lives
I had not seen a work of lofty art
Nor woman beauty nor sweet nature face
Yet I say never morn broke clear as those
On the dim clustered isles in the blue sea
The deep groves and white temples and wet caves
And nothing ever will surprise me now 
Who stood beside the naked Swift-footed
Who bound my forehead with Proserpine hair
And strange it is that I who could so dream
Should e'er have stooped to aim at aught beneath 
Aught low or painful but I never doubted
So as I grew I rudely shaped my life
To my immediate wants yet strong beneath
Was a vague sense of power though folded up 
A sense that though those shades and times were past
Their spirit dwelt in me with them should rule
Then came a pause and long restraint chained down
My soul till it was changed I lost myself
And were it not that I so loathe that loss
I could recall how first I learned to turn
My mind against itself and the effects
In deeds for which remorse were vain as for
The wanderings of delirious dream yet thence
Came cunning envy falsehood all world wrong
That spotted me at length I cleansed my soul
Yet long world influence remained and naught
But the still life I led apart once more
Which left me free to seek soul old delights
Could e'er have brought me thus far back to peace
As peace returned I sought out some pursuit
And song rose no new impulse but the one
With which all others best could be combined
My life has not been that of those whose heaven
Was lampless save where poesy shone out
But as a clime where glittering mountain-tops
And glancing sea and forests steeped in light
Give back reflected the far-flashing sun
For music which is earnest of a heaven
Seeing we know emotions strange by it
Not else to be revealed is like a voice
A low voice calling fancy as a friend
To the green woods in the gay summer time
And she fills all the way with dancing shapes
Which have made painters pale and they go on
Till stars look at them and winds call to them
As they leave life path for the twilight world
Where the dead gather This was not at first
For I scarce knew what I would do I had
An impulse but no yearning only sang
And first I sang as I in dream have seen
Music wait on a lyrist for some thought
Yet singing to herself until it came
I turned to those old times and scenes where all
That beautiful had birth for me and made
Rude verses on them all and then I paused 
I had done nothing so I sought to know
What other minds achieved No fear outbroke
As on the works of mighty bards I gazed
In the first joy at finding my own thoughts
Recorded my own fancies justified
And their aspirings but my very own
With them I first explored passion and mind 
All to begin afresh I rather sought
To rival what I wondered at than form
Creations of my own if much was light
Lent by the others much was yet my own
I paused again a change was coming came
I was no more a boy the past was breaking
Before the future and like fever worked
I thought on my new self and all my powers
Burst out I dreamed not of restraint but gazed
On all things schemes and systems went and came
And I was proud being vainest of the weak
In wandering o'er thought world to seek some one
To be my prize as if you wandered o'er
The White Way for a star And my choice fell
Not so much on a system as a man 
On one whom praise of mine shall not offend
Who was as calm as beauty being such
Unto mankind as thou to me Pauline 
Believing in them and devoting all
His soul strength to their winning back to peace
Who sent forth hopes and longings for their sake
Clothed in all passion melodies such first
Caught me and set me slave of a sweet task
To disentangle gather sense from song
Since song-inwoven lurked there words which seemed
A key to a new world the muttering
Of angels something yet unguessed by man
How my heart leapt as still I sought and found
Much there I felt my own soul had conceived
But there living and burning Soon the orb
Of his conceptions dawned on me its praise
Lives in the tongues of men men brows are high
When his name means a triumph and a pride
So my weak voice may well forbear to shame
What seemed decreed my fate I threw myself
To meet it I was vowed to liberty
Men were to be as gods and earth as heaven
And I ah what a life was mine to prove
My whole soul rose to meet it Now Pauline
I shall go mad if I recall that time
Oh let me look back ere I leave forever
The time which was an hour one fondly waits
For a fair girl that comes a withered hag
And I was lonely far from woods and fields
And amid dullest sights who should be loose
As a stag yet I was full of bliss who lived
With Plato and who had the key to life
And I had dimly shaped my first attempt
And many a thought did I build up on thought
As the wild bee hangs cell to cell in vain
For I must still advance no rest for mind
'T was in my plan to look on real life
The life all new to me my theories
Were firm so them I left to look and learn
Mankind its cares hopes fears its woes and joys
And as I pondered on their ways I sought
How best life end might be attained an end
Comprising every joy I deeply mused
And suddenly without heart-wreck I awoke
As from a dream I said 'T was beautiful
Yet but a dream and so adieu to it
As some world-wanderer sees in a far meadow
Strange towers and high-walled gardens thick with trees
Where song takes shelter and delicious mirth
From laughing fairy creatures peeping over
And on the morrow when he comes to lie
Forever 'neath those garden-trees fruit-flushed
Sung round by fairies all his search is vain
First went my hopes of perfecting mankind
Next faith in them and then in freedom self
And virtue self then my own motives ends
And aims and loves and human love went last
I felt this no decay because new powers
Rose as old feelings left wit mockery
Light-heartedness for I had oft been sad
Mistrusting my resolves but now I cast
Hope joyously away I laughed and said
No more of this I must not think at length
I looked again to see if all went well
My powers were greater as some temple seemed
My soul where naught is changed and incense rolls
Around the altar only God is gone
And some dark spirit sitteth in his seat
So I passed through the temple and to me
Knelt troops of shadows and they cried Hail king
We serve thee now and thou shalt serve no more
Call on us prove us let us worship thee
And I said Are ye strong Let fancy bear me
Far from the past And I was borne away
As Arab birds float sleeping in the wind
O'er deserts towers and forests I being calm
And I said I have nursed up energies
They will prey on me And a band knelt low
And cried Lord we are here and we will make
Safe way for thee in thine appointed life
But look on us And I said Ye will worship
Me should my heart not worship too They shouted
Thyself thou art our king So I stood there
Smiling oh vanity of vanities
For buoyant and rejoicing was the spirit
With which I looked out how to end my course
I felt once more myself my powers all mine
I knew while youth and health so lifted me
That spite of all life nothingness no grief
Came nigh me I must ever be light-hearted
And that this knowledge was the only veil
Betwixt joy and despair so if age came
I should be left a wreck linked to a soul
Yet fluttering or mind-broken and aware
Of my decay So a long summer morn
Found me and ere noon came I had resolved
No age should come on me ere youth was spent
For I would wear myself out like that morn
Which wasted not a sunbeam every hour
I would make mine and die And thus I sought
To chain my spirit down which erst I freed
For flights to fame I said The troubled life
Of genius seen so gay when working forth
Some trusted end grows sad when all proves vain 
How sad when men have parted with truth peace
For falsest fancy sake which waited first
As an obedient spirit when delight
Came without fancy call but alters soon
Comes darkened seldom hastens to depart
Leaving a heavy darkness and warm tears
But I shall never lose her she will live
Dearer for such seclusion I but catch
A hue a glance of what I sing so pain
Is linked with pleasure for I ne'er may tell
Half the bright sights which dazzle me but now
Mine shall be all the radiance let them fade
Untold others shall rise as fair as fast
And when all done the few dim gleams transferred 
For a new thought sprang up how well it were
Discarding shadowy hope to weave such lays
As straight encircle men with praise and love
So I should not die utterly should bring
One branch from the gold forest like the knight
Of old tales witnessing I had been there 
And when all done how vain seems e'en success 
The vaunted influence poets have o'er men
'Tis a fine thing that one weak as myself
Should sit in his lone room knowing the words
He utters in his solitude shall move
Men like a swift wind that though dead and gone
New eyes shall glisten when his beauteous dreams
Of love come true in happier frames than his
Ay the still night brings thoughts like these but morn
Comes and the mockery again laughs out
At hollow praises smiles allied to sneers
And my soul idol ever whispers me
To dwell with him and his unhonored song
And I foreknow my spirit that would press
First in the struggle fail again to make
All bow enslaved and I again should sink
And then know that this curse will come on us
To see our idols perish we may wither
No marvel we are clay but our low fate
Should not extend to those whom trustingly
We sent before into time yawning gulf
To face what dread may lurk in darkness there
To find the painter glory pass and feel
Music can move us not as once or worst
To weep decaying wits ere the frail body
Decays Naught makes me trust some love is true
But the delight of the contented lowness
With which I gaze on him I keep forever
Above me I to rise and rival him
Feed his fame rather from my heart best blood
Wither unseen that he may flourish still
Pauline my soul friend thou dost pity yet
How this mood swayed me when that soul found thine
When I had set myself to live this life
Defying all past glory Ere thou camest
I seemed defiant sweet for old delights
Had flocked like birds again music my life
Nourished me more than ever then the lore
Loved for itself and all it shows that king
Treading the purple calmly to his death
While round him like the clouds of eve all dusk
The giant shades of fate silently flitting
Pile the dim outline of the coming doom
And him sitting alone in blood while friends
Are hunting far in the sunshine and the boy
With his white breast and brow and clustering curls
Streaked with his mother blood but striving hard
To tell his story ere his reason goes
And when I loved thee as love seemed so oft
Thou lovedst me indeed I wondering searched
My heart to find some feeling like such love
Believing I was still much I had been
Too soon I found all faith had gone from me
And the late glow of life like change on clouds
Proved not the morn-blush widening into day
But eve faint-colored by the dying sun
While darkness hastens quickly I will tell
My state as though 't were none of mine despair
Cannot come near us this it is my state
Souls alter not and mine must still advance
Strange that I knew not when I flung away
My youth chief aims their loss might lead to loss
Of what few I retained and no resource
Be left me for behold how changed is all
I cannot chain my soul it will not rest
In its clay prison this most narrow sphere
It has strange impulse tendency desire
Which nowise I account for nor explain
But cannot stifle being bound to trust
All feelings equally to hear all sides
How can my life indulge them yet they live
Referring to some state of life unknown
My selfishness is satiated not
It wears me like a flame my hunger for
All pleasure howsoe'er minute grows pain
I envy how I envy him whose soul
Turns its whole energies to some one end
To elevate an aim pursue success
However mean So my still baffled hope
Seeks out abstractions I would have one joy
But one in life so it were wholly mine
One rapture all my soul could fill and this
Wild feeling places me in dream afar
In some vast country where the eye can see
No end to the far hills and dales bestrewn
With shining towers and towns till I grow mad
Well-nigh to know not one abode but holds
Some pleasure while my soul could grasp the world
But must remain this vile form slave I look
With hope to age at last which quenching much
May let me concentrate what sparks it spares
This restlessness of passion meets in me
A craving after knowledge the sole proof
Of yet commanding will is in that power
Repressed for I beheld it in its dawn
The sleepless harpy with just-budding wings
And I considered whether to forego
All happy ignorant hopes and fears to live
Finding a recompense in its wild eyes
And when I found that I should perish so
I bade its wild eyes close from me forever
And I am left alone with old delights
See it lies in me a chained thing still prompt
To serve me if I loose its slightest bond
I cannot but be proud of my bright slave
How should this earth life prove my only sphere
Can I so narrow sense but that in life
Soul still exceeds it In their elements
My love outsoars my reason but since love
Perforce receives its object from this earth
While reason wanders chainless the few truths
Caught from its wanderings have sufficed to quell
Love chained below then what were love set free
Which with the object it demands would pass
Reason companioning the seraphim
No what I feel may pass all human love
Yet fall far short of what my love should be
And yet I seem more warped in this than aught
Myself stands out more hideously of old
I could forget myself in friendship fame
Liberty nay in love of mightier souls
But I begin to know what thing hate is 
To sicken and to quiver and grow white 
And I myself have furnished its first prey
Hate of the weak and ever-wavering will
The selfishness the still-decaying frame 
But I must never grieve whom wing can waft
Far from such thoughts as now Andromeda
And she is with me years roll I shall change
But change can touch her not so beautiful
With her fixed eyes earnest and still and hair
Lifted and spread by the salt-sweeping breeze
And one red beam all the storm leaves in heaven
Resting upon her eyes and hair such hair
As she awaits the snake on the wet beach
By the dark rock and the white wave just breaking
At her feet quite naked and alone a thing
I doubt not nor fear for secure some god
To save will come in thunder from the stars
Let it pass Soul requires another change
I will be gifted with a wondrous mind
Yet sunk by error to men sympathy
And in the wane of life yet only so
As to call up their fears and there shall come
A time requiring youth best energies
And lo I fling age sorrow sickness off
And rise triumphant triumph through decay
And thus it is that I supply the chasm
'Twixt what I am and all I fain would be
But then to know nothing to hope for nothing
To seize on life dull joys from a strange fear
Lest losing them all lost and naught remains
There  some vile juggle with my reason here
I feel I but explain to my own loss
These impulses they live no less the same
Liberty what though I despair my blood
Rose never at a slave name proud as now
Oh sympathies obscured by sophistries 
Why else have I sought refuge in myself
But from the woes I saw and could not stay
Love is not this to love thee my Pauline
I cherish prejudice lest I be left
Utterly loveless witness my belief
In poets though sad change has come there too
No more I leave myself to follow them 
Unconsciously I measure me by them 
Let me forget it and I cherish most
My love of England how her name a word
Of hers in a strange tongue makes my heart beat
Pauline could I but break the spell Not now 
All fever but when calm shall come again
I am prepared I have made life my own
I would not be content with all the change
One frame should feel but I have gone in thought
Through all conjuncture I have lived all life
When it is most alive where strangest fate
New-shapes it past surmise the throes of men
Bit by some curse or in the grasps of doom
Half-visible and still-increasing round
Or crowning their wide being general aim
These are wild fancies but I feel sweet friend
As one breathing his weakness to the ear
Of pitying angel dear as a winter flower
A slight flower growing alone and offering
Its frail cup of three leaves to the cold sun
Yet joyous and confiding like the triumph
Of a child and why am I not worthy thee
I can live all the life of plants and gaze
Drowsily on the bees that flit and play
Or bare my breast for sunbeams which will kill
Or open in the night of sounds to look
For the dim stars I can mount with the bird
Leaping airily his pyramid of leaves
And twisted boughs of some tall mountain tree
Or rise cheerfully springing to the heavens
Or like a fish breathe deep the morning air
In the misty sun-warm water or with flower
And tree can smile in light at the sinking sun
Just as the storm comes as a girl would look
On a departing lover most serene
Pauline come with me see how I could build
A home for us out of the world in thought
I am uplifted fly with me Pauline
Night and one single ridge of narrow path
Between the sullen river and the woods
Waving and muttering for the moonless night
Has shaped them into images of life
Like the uprising of the giant-ghosts
Looking on earth to know how their sons fare
Thou art so close by me the roughest swell
Of wind in the tree-tops hides not the panting
Of thy soft breasts No we will pass to morning 
Morning the rocks and valleys and old woods
How the sun brightens in the mist and here
Half in the air like creatures of the place
Trusting the element living on high boughs
That swing in the wind look at the silver spray
Flung from the foam-sheet of the cataract
Amid the broken rocks Shall we stay here
With the wild hawks No ere the hot noon come
Dive we down safe See this our new retreat
Walled in with a sloped mound of matted shrubs
Dark tangled old and green still sloping down
To a small pool whose waters lie asleep
Amid the trailing boughs turned water-plants
And tall trees overarch to keep us in
Breaking the sunbeams into emerald shafts
And in the dreamy water one small group
Of two or three strange trees are got together
Wondering at all around as strange beasts herd
Together far from their own land all wildness
No turf nor moss for boughs and plants pave all
And tongues of bank go shelving in the lymph
Where the pale-throated snake reclines his head
And old gray stones lie making eddies there
The wild-mice cross them dry-shod Deeper in
Shut thy soft eyes now look still deeper in
This is the very heart of the woods all round
Mountain-like heaped above us yet even here
One pond of water gleams far off the river
Sweeps like a sea barred out from land but one 
One thin clear sheet has overleaped and wound
Into this silent depth which gained it lies
Still as but let by sufferance the trees bend
O'er it as wild men watch a sleeping girl
And through their roots long creeping plants out-stretch
Their twined hair steeped and sparkling farther on
Tall rushes and thick flag-knots have combined
To narrow it so at length a silver thread
It winds all noiselessly through the deep wood
Till through a cleft-way through the moss and stone
It joins its parent-river with a shout
Up for the glowing day leave the old woods
See they part like a ruined arch the sky
Nothing but sky appears so close the roots
And grass of the hill-top level with the air 
Blue sunny air where a great cloud floats laden
With light like a dead whale that white birds pick
Floating away in the sun in some north sea
Air air fresh life-blood thin and searching air
The clear dear breath of God that loveth us
Where small birds reel and winds take their delight
Water is beautiful but not like air
See where the solid azure waters lie
Made as of thickened air and down below
The fern-ranks like a forest spread themselves
As though each pore could feel the element
Where the quick glancing serpent winds his way
Float with me there Pauline but not like air
Down the hill Stop a clump of trees see set
On a heap of rock which look o'er the far plain
So envious climbing shrubs would mount to rest
And peer from their spread boughs wide they wave looking
At the muleteers who whistle on their way
To the merry chime of morning bells past all
The little smoking cots mid fields and banks
And copses bright in the sun My spirit wanders
Hedgerows for me those living hedgerows where
The bushes close and clasp above and keep
Thought in I am concentrated I feel
But my soul saddens when it looks beyond
I cannot be immortal taste all joy
O God where do they tend these struggling aims
What would I have What is this sleep which seems
To bound all can there be a waking point
Of crowning life The soul would never rule
It would be first in all things it would have
Its utmost pleasure filled but that complete
Commanding for commanding sickens it
The last point I can trace is rest beneath
Some better essence than itself in weakness
This is myself not what I think should be
And what is that I hunger for but God
My God my God let me for once look on thee
As though naught else existed we alone
And as creation crumbles my soul spark
Expands till I can say Even from myself
I need thee and I feel thee and I love thee
I do not plead my rapture in thy works
For love of thee nor that I feel as one
Who cannot die but there is that in me
Which turns to thee which loves or which should love
Why have I girt myself with this hell-dress
Why have I labored to put out my life
Is it not in my nature to adore
And e'en for all my reason do I not
Feel him and thank him and pray to him now
Can I forego the trust that he loves me
Do I not feel a love which only ONE
O thou pale form so dimly seen deep-eyed
I have denied thee calmly do I not
Pant when I read of thy consummate power
And burn to see thy calm pure truths out-flash
The brightest gleams of earth philosophy
Do I not shake to hear aught question thee
If I am erring save me madden me
Take from me powers and pleasures let me die
Ages so I see thee I am knit round
As with a charm by sin and lust and pride
Yet though my wandering dreams have seen all shapes
Of strange delight oft have I stood by thee 
Have I been keeping lonely watch with thee
In the damp night by weeping Olivet
Or leaning on thy bosom proudly less
Or dying with thee on the lonely cross
Or witnessing thine outburst from the tomb
A mortal sin familiar friend doth here
Avow that he will give all earth reward
But to believe and humbly teach the faith
In suffering and poverty and shame
Only believing he is not unloved
And now my Pauline I am thine forever
I feel the spirit which has buoyed me up
Desert me and old shades are gathering fast
Yet while the last light waits I would say much
This chiefly it is gain that I have said
Somewhat of love I ever felt for thee
But seldom told our hearts so beat together
That speech seemed mockery but when dark hours come
And joy departs and thou sweet deem'st it strange
A sorrow moves me thou canst not remove
Look on this lay I dedicate to thee
Which through thee I began which thus I end
Collecting the last gleams to strive to tell
How I am thine and more than ever now
That I sink fast yet though I deeplier sink
No less song proves one word has brought me bliss
Another still may win bliss surely back
Thou knowest dear I could not think all calm
For fancies followed thought and bore me off
And left all indistinct ere one was caught
Another glanced so dazzled by my wealth
I knew not which to leave nor which to choose
For all so floated naught was fixed and firm
And then thou said'st a perfect bard was one
Who chronicled the stages of all life
And so thou bad'st me shadow this first stage
'T is done and even now I recognize
The shift the change from last to past discern
Faintly how life is truth and truth is good
And why thou must be mine is that e'en now
In the dim hush of night that I have done
Despite the sad forebodings love looks through 
Whispers E'en at the last I have her still
With her delicious eyes as clear as heaven
When rain in a quick shower has beat down mist
And clouds float white above like broods of swans
How the blood lies upon her cheek outspread
As thinned by kisses only in her lips
It wells and pulses like a living thing
And her neck looks like marble misted o'er
With love-breath a Pauline from heights above
Stooping beneath me looking up one look
As I might kill her and be loved the more
So love me me Pauline and naught but me
Never leave loving Words are wild and weak
Believe them not Pauline I stained myself
But to behold thee purer by my side
To show thou art my breath my life a last
Resource an extreme want never believe
Aught better could so look on thee nor seek
Again the world of good thoughts left for mine
There were bright troops of undiscovered suns
Each equal in their radiant course there were
Clusters of far fair isles which ocean kept
For his own joy and his waves broke on them
Without a choice and there was a dim crowd
Of visions each a part of some grand whole
And one star left his peers and came with peace
Upon a storm and all eyes pined for him
And one isle harbored a sea-beaten ship
And the crew wandered in its bowers and plucked
Its fruits and gave up all their hopes of home
And one dream came to a pale poet sleep
And he said I am singled out by God
No sin must touch me Words are wild and weak
But what they would express is Leave me not
Still sit by me with beating breast and hair
Loosened be watching earnest by my side
Turning my books or kissing me when I
Look up like summer wind Be still to me
A help to music mystery which mind fails
To fathom its solution no mere clue
O reason pedantry life rule prescribed
I hopeless I the loveless hope and love
Wiser and better know me now not when
You loved me as I was Smile not I have
Much yet to dawn on you to gladden you
No more of the past I'll look within no more
I have too trusted my own lawless wants
Too trusted my vain self vague intuition 
Draining soul wine alone in the still night
And seeing how as gathering films arose
As by an inspiration life seemed bare
And grinning in its vanity while ends
Foul to be dreamed of smiled at me as fixed
And fair while others changed from fair to foul
As a young witch turns an old hag at night
No more of this We will go hand in hand
I with thee even as a child love slave
Looking no farther than his liege commands
And thou hast chosen where this life shall be
The land which gave me thee shall be our home
Where nature lies all wild amid her lakes
And snow-swathed mountains and vast pines begirt
With ropes of snow where nature lies all bare
Suffering none to view her but a race
Or stinted or deformed like the mute dwarfs
Which wait upon a naked Indian queen
And there the time being when the heavens are thick
With storm I'll sit with thee while thou dost sing
Thy native songs gay as a desert bird
Which crieth as it flies for perfect joy
Or telling me old stories of dead knights
Or I will read great lays to thee how she
The fair pale sister went to her chill grave
With power to love and to be loved and live
Or we will go together like twin gods
Of the infernal world with scented lamp
Over the dead to call and to awake
Over the unshaped images which lie
Within my mind cave only leaving all
That tells of the past doubt So when spring comes
With sunshine back again like an old smile
And the fresh waters and awakened birds
And budding woods await us I shall be
Prepared and we will question life once more
Till its old sense shall come renewed by change
Like some clear thought which harsh words veiled before
Feeling God loves us and that all which errs
Is but a dream which death will dissipate
And then what need of longer exile Seek
My England and again there calm approach
All I once fled from calmly look on those
The works of my past weakness as one views
Some scene where danger met him long before
Ah that such pleasant life should be but dreamed
But whate'er come of it and though it fade
And though ere the cold morning all be gone
As it may be though music wait to wile
And strange eyes and bright wine lure laugh like sin
Which steals back softly on a soul half saved
And I the first deny decry despise
With this avowal these intents so fair 
Still be it all my own this moment pride
No less I make an end in perfect joy
E'en in my brightest time a lurking fear
Possessed me I well knew my weak resolves
I felt the witchery that makes mind sleep
Over its treasure as one half afraid
To make his riches definite but now
These feelings shall not utterly be lost
I shall not know again that nameless care
Lest leaving all undone in youth some new
And undreamed end reveal itself too late
For this song shall remain to tell forever
That when I lost all hope of such a change
Suddenly beauty rose on me again
No less I make an end in perfect joy
For I who thus again was visited
Shall doubt not many another bliss awaits
And though this weak soul sink and darkness whelm
Some little word shall light it raise aloft
To where I clearlier see and better love
As I again go o'er the tracts of thought
Like one who has a right and I shall live
With poets calmer purer still each time
And beauteous shapes will come for me to seize
And unknown secrets will be trusted me
Which were denied the waverer once but now
I shall be priest and prophet as of old
Sun-treader I believe in God and truth
And love and as one just escaped from death
Would bind himself in bands of friends to feel
He lives indeed so I would lean on thee
Thou must be ever with me most in gloom
If such must come but chiefly when I die
For I seem dying as one going in the dark
To fight a giant but live thou forever
And be to all what thou hast been to me
All in whom this wakes pleasant thoughts of me
Know my last state is happy free from doubt
Or touch of fear Love me and wish me well
This is the bookful thus far take the truth
The untempered gold the fact untampered with
The mere ring-metal ere the ring be made
And what has hitherto come of it Who preserves
The memory of this Guido and his wife
Pompilia more than Ademollo name
The etcher of those prints two crazie each
Saved by a stone from snowing broad the Square
With scenic backgrounds Was this truth of force
Able to take its own part as truth should
Sufficient self-sustaining Why if so 
Yonder  a fire into it goes my book
As who shall say me nay and what the loss
You know the tale already I may ask
Rather than think to tell you more thereof 
Ask you not merely who were he and she
Husband and wife what manner of mankind
But how you hold concerning this and that
Other yet-unnamed actor in the piece
The young frank handsome courtly Canon now
The priest declared the lover of the wife
He who no question did elope with her
For certain bring the tragedy about
Giuseppe Caponsacchi his strange course
I' the matter was it right or wrong or both
Then the old couple slaughtered with the wife
By the husband as accomplices in crime
Those Comparini Pietro and his spouse 
What say you to the right or wrong of that
When at a known name whispered through the door
Of a lone villa on a Christmas night
It opened that the joyous hearts inside
Might welcome as it were an angel-guest
Come in Christ name to knock and enter sup
And satisfy the loving ones he saved
And so did welcome devils and their death
I have been silent on that circumstance
Although the couple passed for close of kin
To wife and husband were by some accounts
Pompilia very parents you know best
Also that infant the great joy was for
That Gaetano the wife two-weeks' babe
The husband first-born child his son and heir
Whose birth and being turned his night to day 
Why must the father kill the mother thus
Because she bore his son and saved himself
Well British Public ye who like me not
God love you and will have your proper laugh
At the dark question laugh it I laugh first
Truth must prevail the proverb vows and truth
 Here is it all i' the book at last as first
There it was all i' the heads and hearts of Rome
Gentle and simple never to fall nor fade
Nor be forgotten Yet a little while
The passage of a century or so
Decads thrice five and here  time paid his tax
Oblivion gone home with her harvesting
And all left smooth again as scythe could shave
Far from beginning with you London folk
I took my book to Rome first tried truth power
On likely people Have you met such names
Is a tradition extant of such facts
Your law-courts stand your records frown a-row
What if I rove and rummage  Why you 'll waste
Your pains and end as wise as you began
Every one snickered names and facts thus old
Are newer much than Europe news we find
Down in to-day Diario Records quotha
Why the French burned them what else do the French
The rap-and-rending nation And it tells
Against the Church no doubt another gird
At the Temporality your Trial of course
 Quite otherwise this time submitted I
Clean for the Church and dead against the world
The flesh and the devil does it tell for once
 The rarer and the happier All the same
Content you with your treasure of a book
And waive what  wanting Take a friend advice
It  not the custom of the country Mend
Your ways indeed and we may stretch a point
Go get you manned by Manning and new-manned
By Newman and mayhap wise-manned to boot
By Wiseman and we 'll see or else we won't
Thanks meantime for the story long and strong
A pretty piece of narrative enough
Which scarce ought so to drop out one would think
From the more curious annals of our kind
Do you tell the story now in off-hand style
Straight from the book Or simply here and there
The while you vault it through the loose and large
Hang to a hint Or is there book at all
And don't you deal in poetry make-believe
And the white lies it sounds like Yes and no
From the book yes thence bit by bit I dug
The lingot truth that memorable day
Assayed and knew my piecemeal gain was gold 
Yes but from something else surpassing that
Something of mine which mixed up with the mass
Made it bear hammer and be firm to file
Fancy with fact is just one fact the more
To wit that fancy has informed transpierced
Thridded and so thrown fast the facts else free
As right through ring and ring runs the djereed
And binds the loose one bar without a break
I fused my live soul and that inert stuff
Before attempting smithcraft on the night
After the day when truth thus grasped and gained 
The book was shut and done with and laid by
On the cream-colored massive agate broad
'Neath the twin cherubs in the tarnished frame
O' the mirror tall thence to the ceiling-top
And from the reading and that slab I leant
My elbow on the while I read and read
I turned to free myself and find the world
And stepped out on the narrow terrace built
Over the street and opposite the church
And paced its lozenge-brickwork sprinkled cool
Because Felice-church-side stretched aglow
Through each square window fringed for festival
Whence came the clear voice of the cloistered ones
Chanting a chant made for midsummer nights 
I know not what particular praise of God
It always came and went with June Beneath
I' the street quick shown by openings of the sky
When flame fell silently from cloud to cloud
Richer than that gold snow Jove rained on Rhodes
The townsmen walked by twos and threes and talked
Drinking the blackness in default of air 
A busy human sense beneath my feet
While in and out the terrace-plants and round
One branch of tall datura waxed and waned
The lamp-fly lured there wanting the white flower
Over the roof o' the lighted church I looked
A bowshot to the street end north away
Out of the Roman gate to the Roman road
By the river till I felt the Apennine
And there would lie Arezzo the man town
The woman trap and cage and torture-place
Also the stage where the priest played his part
A spectacle for angels ay indeed
There lay Arezzo Farther then I fared
Feeling my way on through the hot and dense
Romeward until I found the wayside inn
By Castelnuovo few mean hut-like homes
Huddled together on the hill-foot bleak
Bare broken only by that tree or two
Against the sudden bloody splendor poured
Cursewise in day departure by the sun
O'er the low house-roof of that squalid inn
Where they three for the first time and the last
Husband and wife and priest met face to face
Whence I went on again the end was near
Step by step missing none and marking all
Till Rome itself the ghastly goal I reached
Why all the while how could it otherwise 
The life in me abolished the death of things
Deep calling unto deep as then and there
Acted itself over again once more
The tragic piece I saw with my own eyes
In Florence as I trod the terrace breathed
The beauty and the fearfulness of night
How it had run this round from Rome to Rome 
Because you are to know they lived at Rome
Pompilia parents as they thought themselves
Two poor ignoble hearts who did their best
Part God way part the other way than God's
To somehow make a shift and scramble through
The world mud careless if it splashed and spoiled
Provided they might so hold high keep clean
Their child soul one soul white enough for three
And lift it to whatever star should stoop
What possible sphere of purer life than theirs
Should come in aid of whiteness hard to save
I saw the star stoop that they strained to touch
And did touch and depose their treasure on
As Guido Franceschini took away
Pompilia to be his forevermore
While they sang Now let us depart in peace
Having beheld thy glory Guido wife
I saw the star supposed but fog o' the fen
Gilded star-fashion by a glint from hell
Having been heaved up haled on its gross way
By hands unguessed before invisible help
From a dark brotherhood and specially
Two obscure goblin creatures fox-faced this
Cat-clawed the other called his next of kin
By Guido the main monster cloaked and caped
Making as they were priests to mock God more 
Abate Paul Canon Girolamo
These who had rolled the starlike pest to Rome
And stationed it to suck up and absorb
The sweetness of Pompilia rolled again
That bloated bubble with her soul inside
Back to Arezzo and a palace there 
Or say a fissure in the honest earth
Whence long ago had curled the vapor first
Blown big by nether fires to appall day
It touched home broke and blasted far and wide
I saw the cheated couple find the cheat
And guess what foul rite they were captured for 
Too fain to follow over hill and dale
That child of theirs caught up thus in the cloud
And carried by the Prince o' the Power of the Air
Whither he would to wilderness or sea
I saw them in the potency of fear
Break somehow through the satyr-family
For a gray mother with a monkey-mien
Mopping and mowing was apparent too
As confident of capture all took hands
And danced about the captives in a ring
 Saw them break through breathe safe at Rome again
Saved by the selfish instinct losing so
Their loved one left with haters These I saw
In recrudescency of baffled hate
Prepare to wring the uttermost revenge
From body and soul thus left them all was sure
Fire laid and caldron set the obscene ring traced
The victim stripped and prostrate what of God
The cleaving of a cloud a cry a crash
Quenched lay their caldron cowered i' the dust the crew
As in a glory of armor like Saint George
Out again sprang the young good beauteous priest
Bearing away the lady in his arms
Saved for a splendid minute and no more
For whom i' the path did that priest come upon
He and the poor lost lady borne so brave
 Checking the song of praise in me had else
Swelled to the full for God will done on earth 
Whom but a dusk misfeatured messenger
No other than the angel of this life
Whose care is lest men see too much at once
He made the sign such God-glimpse must suffice
Nor prejudice the Prince o' the Power of the Air
Whose ministration piles us overhead
What we call first earth roof and last heaven floor
Now grate o' the trap then outlet of the cage
So took the lady left the priest alone
And once more canopied the world with black
But through the blackness I saw Rome again
And where a solitary villa stood
In a lone garden-quarter it was eve
The second of the year and oh so cold
Ever and anon there flittered through the air
A snow-flake and a scanty couch of snow
Crusted the grass-walk and the garden-mould
All was grave silent sinister when ha
Glimmeringly did a pack of were-wolves pad
The snow those flames were Guido eyes in front
And all five found and footed it the track
To where a threshold-streak of warmth and light
Betrayed the villa-door with life inside
While an inch outside were those blood-bright eyes
And black lips wrinkling o'er the flash of teeth
And tongues that lolled O God that madest man
They parleyed in their language Then one whined 
That was the policy and master-stroke 
Deep in his throat whispered what seemed a name 
Open to Caponsacchi Guido cried
Gabriel cried Lucifer at Eden-gate
Wide as a heart opened the door at once
Showing the joyous couple and their child
The two-weeks' mother to the wolves the wolves
To them Close eyes And when the corpses lay
Stark-stretched and those the wolves their wolf-work done
Were safe-embosomed by the night again
I knew a necessary change in things
As when the worst watch of the night gives way
And there comes duly to take cognizance
The scrutinizing eye-point of some star 
And who despairs of a new daybreak now
Lo the first ray protruded on those five
It reached them and each felon writhed transfixed
Awhile they palpitated on the spear
Motionless over Tophet stand or fall
I say the spear should fall should stand I say
Cried the world come to judgment granting grace
Or dealing doom according to world wont
Those world's-bystanders grouped on Rome cross-road
At prick and summons of the primal curse
Which bids man love as well as make a lie
There prattled they discoursed the right and wrong
Turned wrong to right proved wolves sheep and sheep wolves
So that you scarce distinguished fell from fleece
Till out spoke a great guardian of the fold
Stood up put forth his hand that held the crook
And motioned that the arrested point decline
Horribly off the wriggling dead-weight reeled
Rushed to the bottom and lay ruined there
Though still at the pit mouth despite the smoke
O' the burning tarriers turned again to talk
And trim the balance and detect at least
A touch of wolf in what showed whitest sheep
A cross of sheep redeeming the whole wolf 
Vex truth a little longer less and less
Because years came and went and more and more
Brought new lies with them to be loved in turn
Till all at once the memory of the thing 
The fact that wolves or sheep such creatures were 
Which hitherto however men supposed
Had somehow plain and pillar-like prevailed
I' the midst of them indisputably fact
Granite time tooth should grate against not graze 
Why this proved sandstone friable fast to fly
And give its grain away at wish o' the wind
Ever and ever more diminutive
Base gone shaft lost only entablature
Dwindled into no bigger than a book
Lay of the column and that little left
By the roadside 'mid the ordure shards and weeds
Until I haply wandering that lone way
Kicked it up turned it over and recognized
For all the crumblement this abacus
This square old yellow book could calculate
By this the lost proportions of the style
This was it from my fancy with those facts
I used to tell the tale turned gay to grave
But lacked a listener seldom such alloy
Such substance of me interfused the gold
Which wrought into a shapely ring therewith
Hammered and filed fingered and favored last
Lay ready for the renovating wash
O' the water How much of the tale was true
I disappeared the book grew all in all
The lawyers' pleadings swelled back to their size 
Doubled in two the crease upon them yet
For more commodity of carriage see 
And these are letters veritable sheets
That brought post-haste the news to Florence writ
At Rome the day Count Guido died we find
To stay the craving of a client there
Who bound the same and so produced my book
Lovers of dead truth did ye fare the worse
Lovers of live truth found ye false my tale
Well now there  nothing in nor out o' the world
Good except truth yet this the something else
What  this then which proves good yet seems untrue
This that I mixed with truth motions of mine
That quickened made the inertness malleolable
O' the gold was not mine what  your name for this
Are means to the end themselves in part the end
Is fiction which makes fact alive fact too
I waited thirty years may it please the Court
Saw meanwhile many a denizen o' the dung
Hop skip jump o'er my shoulder make him wings
And fly aloft succeed in the usual phrase
Every one soon or late comes round by Rome
Stand still here you'll see all in turn succeed
Why look you so and so the physician here
My father lacquey son we sent to school
Doctored and dosed this Eminence and that
Salved the last Pope his certain obstinate sore
Soon bought land as became him names it now
I grasp bell at his griffin-guarded gate
Traverse the half-mile avenue a term
A cypress and a statue three and three 
Deliver message from my Monsignor
With varletry at lounge i' the vestibule
I 'm barred from who bear mud upon my shoe
My father chaplain nephew Chamberlain 
Nothing less please you courteous all the same
 He does not see me though I wait an hour
At his staircase-landing 'twixt the brace of busts
A noseless Sylla Marius maimed to match
My father gave him for a hexastich
Made on my birthday but he sends me down
To make amends that relic I prize most 
The unburnt end o' the very candle Sirs
Purfled with paint so prettily round and round
He carried in such state last Peter's-day 
In token I his gentleman and squire
Had held the bridle walked his managed mule
Without a tittup the procession through
Nay the official one you know sweet lords 
Who drew the warrant for my transfer late
To the New Prisons from Tordinona he
Graciously had remembrance  Francesc ha
His sire now how a thing shall come about 
Paid me a dozen florins above the fee
For drawing deftly up a deed of sale
When troubles fell so thick on him good heart
And I was prompt and pushing By all means
At the New Prisons be it his son shall lie 
Anything for an old friend and thereat
Signed name with triple flourish underneath
These were my fellows such their fortunes now
While I kept fasts and feasts innumerable
Matins and vespers functions to no end
I' the train of Monsignor and Eminence
As gentleman-squire and for my zeal reward
Have rarely missed a place at the table-foot
Except when some Ambassador or such like
Brought his own people Brief one day I felt
The tick of time inside me turning-point
And slight sense there was now enough of this
That I was near my seventh climacteric
Hard upon if not over the middle life
And although fed by the east-wind fulsome-fine
With foretaste of the Land of Promise still
My gorge gave symptom it might play me false
Better not press it further be content
With living and dying only a nobleman
Who merely had a father great and rich
Who simply had one greater and richer yet
And so on back and back till first and best
Began i' the night I finish in the day
The mother must be getting old I said
The sisters are well wedded away our name
Can manage to pass a sister off at need
And do for dowry both my brothers thrive 
Regular priests they are nor bat-like 'bide
'Twixt flesh and fowl with neither privilege
My spare revenue must keep me and mine
I am tired Arezzo air is good to breathe
Vittiano one limes flocks of thrushes there
A leathern coat costs little and lasts long
Let me bid hope good-by content at home
Thus one day I disbosomed me and bowed
Whereat began the little buzz and thrill
O' the gazers round me each face brightened up
As when at your Casino deep in dawn
A gamester says at last I play no more
Forego gain acquiesce in loss withdraw
Anyhow and the watchers of his ways
A trifle struck compunctious at the word
Yet sensible of relief breathe free once more
Break up the ring venture polite advice 
How Sir So scant of heart and hope indeed
Retire with neither cross nor pile from play 
So incurious so short-casting give your chance
To a younger stronger bolder spirit belike
Just when luck turns and the fine throw sweeps all
Such was the chorus and its goodwill meant 
See that the loser leave door handsomely
There  an ill look it  sinister spoils sport
When an old bruised and battered year-by-year
Fighter with fortune not a penny in poke
Reels down the steps of our establishment
And staggers on broad daylight and the world
In shagrag beard and doleful doublet drops
And breaks his heart on the outside people prate
'Such is the profit of a trip upstairs
Contrive he sidle forth balked of the blow
Best dealt by way of moral bidding down
No curse but blessings rather on our heads
For some poor prize he bears at tattered breast
Some palpable sort of kind of good to set
Over and against the grievance give him quick
Whereon protested Paul Go hang yourselves
Leave him to me Count Guido and brother of mine
A word in your ear Take courage since faint heart
Ne'er won aha fair lady don't men say
There  a sors there  a right Virgilian dip
Do you see the happiness o' the hint At worst
If the Church want no more of you the Court
No more and the Camp as little the ingrates come
Count you are counted still you've coat to back
Not cloth of gold and tissue as we hoped
But cloth with sparks and spangles on its frieze
From Camp Court Church enough to make a shine
Entitle you to carry home a wife
With the proper dowry let the worst betide
Why it was just a wife you meant to take
Now Paul advice was weighty priests should know
And Paul apprised me ere the week was out
That Pietro and Violante the easy pair
The cits enough with stomach to be more
Had just the daughter and exact the sum
To truck for the quality of myself She  young
Pretty and rich you 're noble classic choice
Is it to be a match A match said I
Done He proposed all I accepted all
And we performed all So I said and did
Simply As simply followed not at first
But with the outbreak of misfortune still
One comment on the saying and doing What
No blush at the avowal you dared buy
A girl of age beseems your granddaughter
Like ox or ass Are flesh and blood a ware
Are heart and soul a chattel
Softly Sirs
Will the Court of its charity teach poor me
Anxious to learn of any way i' the world
Allowed by custom and convenience save
This same which taught from my youth up I trod
Take me along with you where was the wrong step
If what I gave in barter style and state
And all that hangs to Franceschinihood
Were worthless why society goes to ground
Its rules are idiot's-rambling Honor of birth 
If that thing has no value cannot buy
Something with value of another sort
You 've no reward nor punishment to give
I' the giving or the taking honor straight
Your social fabric pinnacle to base
Comes down a-clatter like a house of cards
Get honor and keep honor free from flaw
Aim at still higher honor gabble o' the goose
Go bid a second blockhead like myself
Spend fifty years in guarding bubbles of breath
Soapsuds with air i' the belly gilded brave
Guarded and guided all to break at touch
O' the first young girl hand and first old fool purse
All my privation and endurance all
Love loyalty and labor dared and did
Fiddle-de-dee why doer and darer both 
Count Guido Franceschini had hit the mark
Far better spent his life with more effect
As a dancer or a prizer trades that pay
On the other hand bid this buffoonery cease
Admit that honor is a privilege
The question follows privilege worth what
Why worth the market-price now up now down
Just so with this as with all other ware
Therefore essay the market sell your name
Style and condition to who buys them best
Does my name purchase had I dared inquire
Your niece my lord there would have been rebuff
Though courtesy your Lordship cannot else 
Not altogether Rank for rank may stand
But I have wealth beside you poverty
Your scale flies up there bid a second bid
Rank too and wealth too Reasoned like yourself
But was it to you I went with goods to sell
This time 't was my scale quietly kissed the ground
Mere rank against mere wealth some youth beside
Some beauty too thrown into the bargain just
As the buyer likes or lets alone I thought
To deal o' the square others find fault it seems
The thing is those my offer most concerned
Pietro Violante cried they fair or foul
What did they make o' the terms Preposterous terms
Why then accede so promptly close with such
Nor take a minute to chaffer Bargain struck
They straight grew bilious wished their money back
Repented them no doubt why so did I
So did your Lordship if town-talk be true
Of paying a full farm worth for that piece
By Pietro of Cortona probably
His scholar Ciro Ferri may have retouched 
You caring more for color than design 
Getting a little tired of cupids too
That  incident to all the folk who buy
I am charged I know with gilding fact by fraud
I falsified and fabricated wrote
Myself down roughly richer than I prove
Rendered a wrong revenue grant it all
Mere grace mere coquetry such fraud I say
A flourish round the figures of a sum
For fashion sake that deceives nobody
The veritable back-bone understood
Essence of this same bargain blank and bare
Being the exchange of quality for wealth 
What may such fancy-flights be Flecks of oil
Flirted by chapmen where plain dealing grates
I may have dripped a drop My name I sell
Not but that I too boast my wealth as they
 We bring you riches still our ancestor
Was hardly the rapscallion folk saw flogged
But heir to we know who were rights of force
They knew and I knew where the back-bone lurked
I' the writhings of the bargain lords believe
I paid down all engaged for to a doit
Delivered them just that which their life long
They hungered in the hearts of them to gain 
Incorporation with nobility thus
In word and deed for that they gave me wealth
But when they came to try their gain my gift
Quit Rome and qualify for Arezzo take
The tone o' the new sphere that absorbed the old
Put away gossip Jack and goody Joan
And go become familiar with the Great
Greatness to touch and taste and handle now 
Why then they found that all was vanity
Vexation and what Solomon describes
The old abundant city-fare was best
The kindly warmth o' the commons the glad clap
Of the equal on the shoulder the frank grin
Of the underling at all so many spoons
Fire-new at neighborly treat best best and best
Beyond compare down to the loll itself
O' the pot-house settle better such a bench
Than the stiff crucifixion by my dais
Under the piecemeal damask canopy
With the coroneted coat-of-arms a-top
Poverty and privation for pride sake
All they engaged to easily brave and bear 
With the fit upon them and their brains a-work 
Proved unendurable to the sobered sots
A banished prince now will exude a juice
And salamander-like support the flame
He dines on chestnuts chucks the husks to help
The broil o' the brazier pays the due baioc
Goes off light-hearted his grimace begins
At the funny humors of the christening-feast
Of friend the money-lender then he  touched
By the flame and frizzles at the babe to kiss
Here was the converse trial opposite mind
Here did a petty nature split on rock
Of vulgar wants predestinate for such 
One dish at supper and weak wine to boot
The prince had grinned and borne the citizen shrieked
Summoned the neighborhood to attest the wrong
Made noisy protest he was murdered stoned
And burned and drowned and hanged then broke away
He and his wife to tell their Rome the rest
And this you admire you men o' the world my lords
This moves compassion makes you doubt my faith
Why I appeal to sun and moon Not I
Rather to Plautus Terence Boccaccio Book
My townsman frank Ser Franco merry Tales 
To all who strip a vizard from a face
A body from its padding and a soul
From froth and ignorance it styles itself 
If this be other than the daily hap
Of purblind greed that dog-like still drops bone
Grasps shadow and then howls the case is hard
So much for them so far now for myself
My profit or loss i' the matter married am I
Text whereon friendly censors burst to preach
Ay at Rome even long ere I was left
To regulate her life for my young bride
Alone at Arezzo friendliness outbroke
Sifting my future to predict its fault
Purchase and sale being thus so plain a point
How of a certain soul bound up maybe
I' the barter with the body and money-bags
From the bride soul what is it you expect
Why loyalty and obedience wish and will
To settle and suit her fresh and plastic mind
To the novel not disadvantageous mould
Father and mother shall the woman leave
Cleave to the husband be it for weal or woe
There is the law what sets this law aside
In my particular case My friends submit
Guide guardian benefactor fee faw fum
The fact is you are forty-five years old
Nor very comely even for that age
Girls must have boys Why let girls say so then
Nor call the boys and men who say the same
Brute this and beast the other as they do
Come cards on table When you chant us next
Epithalamium full to overflow
With praise and glory of white womanhood
The chaste and pure troll no such lies o'er lip
Put in their stead a crudity or two
Such short and simple statement of the case
As youth chalks on our walls at spring of year
No I shall still think nobler of the sex
Believe a woman still may take a man
For the short period that his soul wears flesh
And for the soul sake understand the fault
Of armor frayed by fighting Tush it tempts
One tongue too much I 'll say the law the law
With a wife I look to find all wifeliness
As when I buy timber and twig a tree 
I buy the song o' the nightingale inside
Such was the pact Pompilia from the first
Broke it refused from the beginning day
Either in body or soul to cleave to mine
And published it forthwith to all the world
No rupture you must join ere you can break 
Before we had cohabited a month
She found I was a devil and no man 
Made common cause with those who found as much
Her parents Pietro and Violante moved
Heaven and earth to the rescue of all three
In four months' time the time o' the parents' stay
Arezzo was a-ringing bells in a blaze
With the unimaginable story rife
I' the mouth of man woman and child to wit
My misdemeanor First the lighter side
Ludicrous face of things how very poor
The Franceschini had become at last
The meanness and the misery of each shift
To save a soldo stretch and make ends meet
Next the more hateful aspect how myself
With cruelty beyond Caligula's
Had stripped and beaten robbed and murdered them
The good old couple I decoyed abused
Plundered and then cast out and happily so
Since in due course the abominable comes 
Woe worth the poor young wife left lonely here
Repugnant in my person as my mind
I sought was ever heard of such revenge
 To lure and bind her to so cursed a couch
Such co-embrace with sulphur snake and toad
That she was fain to rush forth call the stones
O' the common street to save her not from hate
Of mine merely but must I burn my lips
With the blister of the lie the satyr-love
Of who but my own brother the young priest
Too long enforced to lenten fare belike
Now tempted by the morsel tossed him full
I' the trencher where lay bread and herbs at best
Mark this yourselves say this none disallows
Was charged to me by the universal voice
At the instigation of my four-months' wife 
And then you ask Such charges so preferred
Truly or falsely here concerns us not
Pricked you to punish now if not before 
Did not the harshness double itself the hate
Harden I answer Have it your way and will
Say my resentment grew apace what then
Do you cry out on the marvel When I find
That pure smooth egg which laid within my nest
Could not but hatch a comfort to us all
Issues a cockatrice for me and mine
Do you stare to see me stamp on it Swans are soft
Is it not clear that she you call my wife
That any wife of any husband caught
Whetting a sting like this against his breast 
Speckled with fragments of the fresh-broke shell
Married a month and making outcry thus 
Proves a plague-prodigy to God and man
She married what was it she married for
Counted upon and meant to meet thereby
Love suggests some one love a little word
Whereof we have not heard one syllable
So the Pompilia child girl wife in one
Wanted the beating pulse the rolling eye
The frantic gesture the devotion due
From Thyrsis to Neaera Guido love 
Why not Provencal roses in his shoe
Plume to his cap and trio of guitars
At casement with a bravo close beside
Good things all these are clearly claimable
When the fit price is paid the proper way
Had it been some friend wife now threw her fan
At my foot with just this pretty scrap attached
Shame death damnation fall these as they may
So I find you for a minute Come this eve
 Why at such sweet self-sacrifice who knows
I might have fired up found me at my post
Ardent from head to heel nor feared catch cough
Nay had some other friend say daughter tripped
Upstairs and tumbled flat and frank on me
Bareheaded and barefooted with loose hair
And garments all at large cried Take me thus
Duke So-and-So the greatest man in Rome 
To escape his hand and heart have I broke bounds
Traversed the town and reached you Then indeed
The lady had not reached a man of ice
I would have rummaged ransacked at the word
Those old odd corners of an empty heart
For remnants of dim love the long disused
And dusty crumblings of romance But here
We talk of just a marriage if you please 
The every-day conditions and no more
Where do these bind me to bestow one drop
Of blood shall dye my wife true-love-knot pink
Pompilia was no pigeon Venus' pet
That shuffled from between her pressing paps
To sit on my rough shoulder but a hawk
I bought at a hawk price and carried home
To do hawk service at the Rotunda say
Where six o' the callow nestlings in a row
You pick and choose and pay the price for such
I have paid my pound await my penny worth
So hoodwink starve and properly train my bird
And should she prove a haggard twist her neck
Did I not pay my name and style my hope
And trust my all Through spending these amiss
I am here 'T is scarce the gravity of the Court
Will blame me that I never piped a tune
Treated my falcon-gentle like my finch
The obligation I incurred was just
To practise mastery prove my mastership 
Pompilia duty was submit herself
Afford me pleasure perhaps cure my bile
Am I to teach my lords what marriage means
What God ordains thereby and man fulfils
Who docile to the dictate treads the house
My lords have chosen the happier part with Paul
And neither marry nor burn yet priestliness
Can find a parallel to the marriage-bond
In its own blessed special ordinance
Whereof indeed was marriage made the type
The Church may show her insubordinate
As marriage her refractory How of the Monk
Who finds the claustral regimen too sharp
After the first month essay What  the mode
With the Deacon who supports indifferently
The rod o' the Bishop when he tastes its smart
Full four weeks Do you straightway slacken hold
Of the innocents the all-unwary ones
Who eager to profess mistook their mind 
Remit a fast-day rigor to the Monk
Who fancied Francis' manna meant roast quails 
Concede the Deacon sweet society
He never thought the Levite-rule renounced 
Or rather prescribe short chain and sharp scourge
Corrective of such peccant humors This 
I take to be the Church mode and mine
If I was over-harsh the worse i' the wife
Who did not win from harshness as she ought
Wanted the patience and persuasion lore
Of love should cure me and console herself
Put case that I mishandle flurry and fright
My hawk through clumsiness in sportsmanship
Twitch out five pens where plucking one would serve 
What shall she bite and claw to mend the case
And if you find I pluck five more for that
Shall you weep How he roughs the turtle there
Such was the starting now of the further step
In lieu of taking penance in good part
The Monk with hue and cry summons a mob
To make a bonfire of the convent say 
And the Deacon pretty piece of virtue save
The ears o' the Court I try to save my head
Instructed by the ingenuous postulant
Taxes the Bishop with adultery mud
Needs must pair off with mud and filth with filth 
Such being my next experience Who knows not 
The couple father and mother of my wife
Returned to Rome published before my lords
Put into print made circulate far and wide
That they had cheated me who cheated them
Pompilia I supposed their daughter drew
Breath first 'mid Rome worst rankness through the deed
Of a drab and a rogue was by-blow bastard-babe
Of a nameless strumpet passed off palmed on me
As the daughter with the dowry Daughter Dirt
O' the kennel Dowry Dust o' the street Naught more
Naught less naught else but oh ah assuredly
A Franceschini and my very wife
Now take this charge as you will for false or true 
This charge preferred before your very selves
Who judge me now I pray you adjudge again
Classing it with the cheats or with the lies
By which category I suffer most
But of their reckoning theirs who dealt with me
In either fashion I reserve my word
Justify that in its place I am now to say
Whichever point o' the charge might poison most
Pompilia duty was no doubtful one
You put the protestation in her mouth
Henceforward and forevermore avaunt
Ye fiends who drop disguise and glare revealed
In your own shape no longer father mine
Nor mother mine Too nakedly you hate
Me whom you looked as if you loved once me
Whom whether true or false your tale now damns
Divulged thus to my public infamy
Private perdition absolute overthrow
For hate my husband to your hearts' content
I spoil and prey of you from first to last
I who have done you the blind service lured
The lion to your pitfall I thus left
To answer for my ignorant bleating there
I should have been remembered and withdrawn
From the first o' the natural fury not flung loose
A proverb and a byword men will mouth
At the cross-way in the corner up and down
Rome and Arezzo there full in my face
If my lord missing them and finding me
Content himself with casting his reproach
To drop i' the street where such impostors die
Ah but that husband what the wonder were 
If far from casting thus away the rag
Smeared with the plague his hand had chanced upon
Sewn to his pillow by Locusta wile 
Far from abolishing root stem and branch
The misgrowth of infectious mistletoe
Foisted into his stock for honest graft 
If he repudiate not renounce nowise
But guarding guiding me maintain my cause
By making it his own what other way
 To keep my name for me he call it his
Claim it of who would take it by their lie 
To save my wealth for me or babe of mine
Their lie was framed to beggar at the birth 
He bid them loose grasp give our gold again
If he become no partner with the pair
Even in a game which played adroitly gives
Its winner life great wonderful new chance 
Of marrying to wit a second time 
Ah if he did thus what a friend were he
Anger he might show who can stamp out flame
Yet spread no black o' the brand yet rough albeit
In the act as whose bare feet feel embers scorch
What grace were his what gratitude were mine
Such protestation should have been my wife's
Looking for this do I exact too much
Why here  the word for word so much no more 
Avowal she made her pure spontaneous speech
To my brother the Abate at first blush
Ere the good impulse had begun to fade
So did she make confession for the pair
So pour forth praises in her own behalf
Ay the false letter interpose my lords 
The simulated writing 't was a trick
You traced the signs she merely marked the same
The product was not hers but yours Alack
I want no more impulsion to tell truth
From the other trick the torture inside there
I confess all let it be understood 
And deny nothing If I baffle you so
Can so fence in the plentitude of right
That my poor lathen dagger puts aside
Each pass o' the Bilboa beats you all the same 
What matters inefficiency of blade
Mine and not hers the letter conceded lords
Impute to me that practice take as proved
I taught my wife her duty made her see
What it behoved her see and say and do
Feel in her heart and with her tongue declare
And whether sluggish or recalcitrant
Forced her to take the right step I myself
Was marching in marital rectitude
Why who finds fault here say the tale be true
Would not my lords commend the priest whose zeal
Seized on the sick morose or moribund
By the palsy-smitten finger made it cross
His brow correctly at the critical time
 Or answered for the inarticulate babe
At baptism in its stead declared the faith
And saved what else would perish unprofessed
True the incapable hand may rally yet
Renounce the sign with renovated strength 
The babe may grow up man and Molinist 
And so Pompilia set in the good path
And left to go alone there soon might see
That too frank-forward all too simple-straight
Her step was and decline to tread the rough
When here lay tempting foot the meadow-side
And there the coppice rang with singing-birds
Soon she discovered she was young and fair
That many in Arezzo knew as much 
Yes this next cup of bitterness my lords
Had to begin go filling drop by drop
Its measure up of full disgust for me
Filtered into by every noisome drain 
Society sink toward which all moisture runs
Would not you prophesy She on whose brow is stamped
The note of the imputation that we know 
Rightly or wrongly mothered with a whore 
Such an one to disprove the frightful charge
What will she but exaggerate chastity
Err in excess of wifehood as it were
Renounce even levities permitted youth
Though not youth struck to age by a thunderbolt
Cry 'wolf' i' the sheepfold where the sheep dares bleat
Knowing the shepherd listens for a growl
So you expect How did the devil decree
Why my lords just the contrary of course
It was in the house from the window at the church
From the hassock where the theatre lent its lodge
Or staging for the public show left space 
That still Pompilia needs must find herself
Launching her looks forth letting looks reply
As arrows to a challenge on all sides
Ever new contribution to her lap
Till one day what is it knocks at my clenched teeth
But the cup full curse-collected all for me
And I must needs drink drink this gallant praise
That minion prayer the other fop reproach
And come at the dregs to Caponsacchi Sirs
I chin deep in a marsh of misery
Struggling to extricate my name and fame
And fortune from the marsh would drown them all
My face the sole unstrangled part of me 
I must have this new gad-fly in that face
Must free me from the attacking lover too
Men say I battled ungracefully enough 
Was harsh uncouth and ludicrous beyond
The proper part o' the husband have it so
Your lordships are considerate at least 
You order me to speak in my defence
Plainly expect no quavering tuneful trills
As when you bid a singer solace you 
Nor look that I shall give it for a grace
Stans pede in uno you remember well
In the one case 'tis a plainsong too severe
This story of my wrongs and that I ache
And need a chair in the other Ask you me
Why when I felt this trouble flap my face
Already pricked with every shame could perch 
When with her parents my wife plagued me too 
Why I enforced not exhortation mild
To leave whore's-tricks and let my brows alone
With mulct of comfits promise of perfume
Far from that No you took the opposite course
Breathed threatenings rage and slaughter What you will
And the end has come the doom is verily here
Unhindered by the threatening See fate flare
Full on each face of the dead guilty three
Look at them well and now lords look at this
Tell me if on that day when I found first
That Caponsacchi thought the nearest way
To his church was some half-mile round by my door
And that he so admired shall I suppose
The manner of the swallows' come-and-go
Between the props o' the window overhead 
That window happening to be my wife 
As to stand gazing by the hour on high
Of May-eves while she sat and let him smile 
If I instead of threatening talking big
Showing hair-powder a prodigious pinch
For poison in a bottle making believe
At desperate doings with a bauble-sword
And other bugaboo-and-baby-work 
Had with the vulgarest household implement
Calmly and quietly cut off clean through bone
But one joint of one finger of my wife
Saying For listening to the serenade
Here your ring-finger shorter a full third
Be certain I will slice away next joint
Next time that anybody underneath
Seems somehow to be sauntering as he hoped
A flower would eddy out of your hand to his
While you please fidget with the branch above
O' the rose-tree in the terrace had I done so
Why there had followed a quick sharp scream some pain
Much calling for plaister damage to the dress
A somewhat sulky countenance next day
Perhaps reproaches but reflections too
I don't hear much of harm that Malchus did
After the incident of the ear my lords
Saint Peter took the efficacious way
Malchus was sore but silenced for his life
He did not hang himself i' the Potter Field
Like Judas who was trusted with the bag
And treated to sops after he proved a thief
So by this time my true and obedient wife
Might have been telling beads with a gloved hand
Awkward a little at pricking hearts and darts
On sampler possibly but well otherwise
Not where Rome shudders now to see her lie
I give that for the course a wise man takes
I took the other however tried the fool's
The lighter remedy brandished rapier dread
With cork-ball at the tip boxed Malchus' ear
Instead of severing the cartilage
Called her a terrible nickname and the like
And there an end and what was the end of that
What was the good effect o' the gentle course
Why one night I went drowsily to bed
Dropped asleep suddenly not suddenly woke
But did wake with rough rousing and loud cry
To find noon in my face a crowd in my room
Fumes in my brain fire in my throat my wife
Gone God knows whither rifled vesture-chest
And ransacked money-coffer What does it mean
The servants had been drugged too stared and yawned
It must be that our lady has eloped
Imperishable tracery devils should foot
And frolic it on around my broken gods
Over my desecrated hearth So much
For the terrible effect of threatening Sirs
Well this way I was shaken wide awake
Doctored and drenched somewhat unpoisoned so
Then set on horseback and bid seek the lost
I started alone head of me heart of me
Fire and each limb as languid ah sweet lords
Bethink you poison-torture try persuade
The next refractory Molinist with that
Floundered through day and night another day
And yet another night and so at last
As Lucifer kept falling to find hell
Tumbled into the court-yard of an inn
At the end and fell on whom I thought to find
Even Caponsacchi what part once was priest
Cast to the winds now with the cassock-rags
In cape and sword a cavalier confessed
There stood he chiding dilatory grooms
Chafing that only horseflesh and no team
Of eagles would supply the last relay
Whirl him along the league the one post more
Between the couple and Rome and liberty
'T was dawn the couple were rested in a sort
And though the lady tired the tenderer sex 
Still lingered in her chamber to adjust
 Oh but we did not write a single word
Somebody forged the letters in our name 
Both in a breath protested presently
Aha Sacchetti again Dame quoth the Duke
What meaneth this epistle counsel me
I pick from out thy placket and peruse
Wherein my page averreth thou art white
And warm and wonderful 'twixt pap and pap
Sir laughed the Lady 't is a counterfeit
Thy page did never stroke but Dian breast
The pretty hound I nurture for thy sake
To lie were losel by my fay no more
And no more say I too and spare the Court
Ah the Court yes I come to the Court self
Such the case so complete in fact and proof
I laid at the feet of law there sat my lords
Here sit they now so may they ever sit
In easier attitude than suits my haunch
In this same chamber did I bare my sores
O' the soul and not the body shun no shame
Shrink from no probing of the ulcerous part
Since confident in Nature which is God 
That she who for wise ends concocts a plague
Curbs at the right time the plague virulence too
Law renovates even Lazarus cures me
Caesar thou seekest To Caesar thou shalt go
Caesar  at Rome to Rome accordingly
Against thy teachings I will ope thee out
My life past present as unlivable
First I was born of this man who had slain
His mother aged sire and sullied so
Married Alkmene she who gave me birth
Now when the basis of a family
Is not laid right what follows needs must fall
And Zeus whoever Zeus is formed me foe
To Here take not thou offence old man
Since father in Zeus' stead account I thee
And while I was at suck yet frightful snakes
She introduced among my swaddling-clothes 
That bedfellow of Zeus to end me so
But when I gained the youthful garb of flesh
The labors I endured what need to tell
What lions ever or three-bodied brutes
Tuphons or giants or the four-legg'd swarms
Of Kentaur-battle did not I end out
And that hound headed all about with heads
Which cropped up twice the Hudra having slain 
I both went through a myriad other toils
In full drove and arrived among the dead
To convoy as Eurustheus bade to light
Haides' three-headed dog and doorkeeper
But then I wretch dared this last labor see
Slew my sons keystone-coped my house with ills
To such a strait I come nor my dear Thebes
Dare I inhabit and suppose I stay
Into what fane or festival of friends
Am I to go My curse scarce courts accost
Shall I seek Argos How if fled from home
But say I hurry to some other town
And there they eye me as notorious now 
Kept by sharp tongue-taunts under lock and key 
Is not this he Zeus' son who murdered once
Children and wife Let him go rot elsewhere
To any man renowned as happy once
Reverses are a grave thing but to whom
Evil is old acquaintance there  no hurt
To speak of he and misery are twins
To this degree of woe I think to come
For earth will utter voice forbidding me
To touch the ground and sea to pierce the wave
The river-springs to drink and I shall play
Ixion part quite out the chained and wheeled
And best of all will be if so I 'scape
Sight from one man of those Hellenes once
I lived among felicitous and rich
Why ought I then to live What gain accrues
From good-for-nothing wicked life I lead
In fine let Zeus' brave consort dance and sing
Stamp foot the Olumpian Zeus' own sandal-trick
What she has willed that brings her will to pass 
The foremost man of Hellas pedestalled
Up over and down whirling Who would pray
To such a goddess that begrudging Zeus
Because he loved a woman ruins me 
Lover of Hellas faultless of the wrong
This strife is from no other of the gods
Than Zeus' wife rightly apprehend as well
Why to no death thou meditatest now 
I would persuade thee but to bear thy woes
None none of mortals boasts a fate unmixed
Nor gods if poets' teaching be not false
Have not they joined in wedlock against law
With one another not for sake of rule
Branded their sires in bondage Yet they house
All the same in Olumpos carry heads
High there notorious sinners though they be
What wilt thou say then if thou mortal-born
Bearest outrageously fate gods endure
Leave Thebes now pay obedience to the law
And follow me to Pallas' citadel
There when thy hands are purified from stain
House will I give thee and goods shared alike
What gifts I hold too from the citizens
For saving twice seven children when I slew
The Knosian bull these also give I thee
And everywhere about the land are plots
Apportioned me these named by thine own name
Shall be henceforward styled by all men thine
Thy life-long but at death when Haides-bound
All Athens shall uphold the honored one
With sacrifices and huge marble heaps
For that a fair crown our Hellenes grant
Their people glory should they help the brave
And I repay thee back this grace for thine
That saved me now that thou art lorn of friends 
Since when the gods give honor friends may flit
For a god help suffices if he please
Ah me these words are foreign to my woes
I neither fancy gods love lawless beds
Nor that with chains they bind each other hands
Have I judged worthy faith at any time
Nor shall I be persuaded one is born
His fellows' master since God stands in need 
If he is really God of naught at all
These are the poets' pitiful conceits
But this it was I pondered though woe-whelmed 
Take heed lest thou be taxed with cowardice
Somehow in leaving thus the light of day
For whoso cannot make a stand against
These same misfortunes neither could withstand
A mere man dart oppose death strength to strength
Therefore unto thy city I will go
And have the grace of thy ten thousand gifts
There I have tasted of ten thousand toils
As truly never waived a single one
Nor let these runnings drop from out my eyes
Nor ever thought it would have come to this 
That I from out my eyes do drop tears Well
At present as it seems one bows to fate
So be it Old man thou seest my exile 
Seest too me my children murderer
These give thou to the tomb and deck the dead
Doing them honor with thy tears since me
Law does not sanction Propping on her breast
And giving them into their mother arms
 Reinstitute the sad community
Which I unhappy brought to nothingness 
Not by my will And when earth hides the dead
Live in this city sad but all the same
Force thy soul to bear woe along with me
O children who begat and gave you birth 
Your father has destroyed you naught you gain
By those fair deeds of mine I laid you up
As by main-force I labored glory out
To give you that fine gift of fatherhood
And thee too O my poor one I destroyed
Not rendering like for like as when thou kept'st
My marriage-bed inviolate those long
Household-seclusions draining to the dregs
Inside my house O me my wife my boys 
And O myself how miserably moved
Am I disyoked now from both boys and wife
Oh bitter those delights of kisses now 
And bitter these my weapons' fellowship
For I am doubtful whether shall I keep
Or cast away these arrows which will clang
Ever such words out as they knock my side 
Us thou didst murder wife and children with
Us child destroyers still thou keepest thine
Ha shall I bear them in my arms then What
Say for excuse Yet naked of my darts
Wherewith I did my bravest Hellas through
Throwing myself beneath foot to my foes
Shall I die basely No relinquishment
Of these must never be companions once
We sorrowfully must observe the pact
In just one thing co-operate with me
Thy sad friend Theseus Go along with him
To Argos and in concert get arranged
The price my due for bringing there the Hound
O land of Kadmos Theban people all
Shear off your locks lament one wide lament
Go to my children grave and in one strain
Lament the whole of us my dead and me 
Since all together are foredone and lost
Smitten by Herd single stroke of fate

I live to please myself I recognize
Power passing mine immeasurable God 
Above me whom he made as heaven beyond
Earth to use figures which assist our sense
I know that he is there as I am here
By the same proof which seems no proof at all
It so exceeds familiar forms of proof
Why there not here Because when I say there
I treat the feeling with distincter shape
That space exists between us I not he 
Live think do human work here no machine
His will moves but a being by myself
His and not he who made me for a work
Watches my working judges its effect
But does not interpose He did so once
And probably will again some time not now
Life being the minute of mankind not God's
In a certain sense like time before and time
After man earthly life so far as man
Needs apprehend the matter Am I clear
Suppose I bid a courier take to-night 
 Once for all let me talk as if I smoked
Yet in the Residenz a personage
I must still represent the thing I was
Galvanically make dead muscle play
Or how shall I illustrate muscle use
I could then last July bid courier take
Message for me post-haste a thousand miles
I bid him since I have the right to bid
And my part done so far his part begins
He starts with due equipment will and power
Means he may use misuse not use at all
At his discretion at his peril too
I leave him to himself but journey done
I count the minutes call for the result
In quickness and the courier quality
Weigh its worth and then punish or reward
According to proved service not before
Meantime he sleeps through noontide rides till dawn
Sticks to the straight road tries the crooked path
Measures and manages resource trusts doubts
Advisers by the wayside does his best
At his discretion lags or launches forth
He knows and I know at his peril too
You see Exactly thus men stand to God
I with my courier God with me Just so
I have his bidding to perform but mind
And body all of me though made and meant
For that sole service must consult concert
With my own self and nobody beside
How to effect the same God helps not else
'T is I who with my stock of craft and strength
Choose the directer cut across the hedge
Or keep the foot-track that respects a crop
Lie down and rest rise up and ran live spare
Feed free all that  my business but arrive
Deliver message bring the answer back
And make my bow I must then God will speak
Praise me or haply blame as service proves
To other men to each and every one
Another law what likelier God perchance
Grants each new man by some as new a mode
Intercommunication with himself
Wreaking on finiteness infinitude
By such a series of effects gives each
Last his own imprint old yet ever new
The process 't is the way of Deity
How it succeeds he knows I only know
That varied modes of creatureship abound
Implying just as varied intercourse
For each with the creator of them all
Each has his own mind and no other mode
What mode may yours be I shall sympathize
No doubt you good young lady that you are
Despite a natural naughtiness or two
Turn eyes up like a Pradier Magdalen
And see an outspread providential hand
Above the owl's-wing aigrette guard and guide 
Visibly o'er your path about your bed
Through all your practisings with London-town
It points you go it stays fixed and you stop
You quicken its procedure by a word
Spoken a thought in silence prayer and praise
Well I believe that such a hand may stoop
And such appeals to it may stave off harm
Pacify the grim guardian of this Square
And stand you in good stead on quarter-day
Quite possible in your case not in mine
Ah but I choose to make the difference
Find the emancipation No I hope
If I deceive myself take noon for night
Please to become determinedly blind
To the true ordinance of human life
Through mere presumption that is my affair
And truly a grave one but as grave I think
Your affair yours the specially observed 
Each favored person that perceives his path
Pointed him inch by inch and looks above
For guidance through the mazes of this world
In what we call its meanest life-career
 Not how to manage Europe properly
But how keep open shop and yet pay rent
Rear household and make both ends meet the same
I say such man is no less tasked than I
To duly take the path appointed him
By whatsoever sign he recognize
Our insincerity on both our heads
No matter what the object of a life
Small work or large the making thrive a shop
Or seeing that an empire take no harm 
There are known fruits to judge obedience by
You 've read a ton weight now of newspaper 
Lives of me gabble about the kind of prince 
You know my work i' the rough I ask you then
Do I appear subordinated less
To hand-impulsion one prime push for all
Than little lives of men the multitude
That cried out every quarter of an hour
For fresh instructions did or did not work
And praised in the odd minutes Eh my dear
Such is the reason why I acquiesced
In doing what seemed best for me to do
So as to please myself on the great scale
Having regard to immortality
No less than life did that which head and heart
Prescribed my hand in measure with its means
Of doing used my special stock of power 
Not from the aforesaid head and heart alone
But every sort of helpful circumstance
Some problematic and some nondescript
All regulated by the single care
I' the last resort that I made thoroughly serve
The when and how toiled where was need reposed
As resolutely at the proper point
Braved sorrow courted joy to just one end
Namely that just the creature I was bound
To be I should become nor thwart at all
God purpose in creation I conceive
No other duty possible to man 
Highest mind lowest mind no other law
By which to judge life failure or success
What folk call being saved or cast away
Such was my rule of life I worked my best
Subject to ultimate judgment God not man's
Well then this settled take your tea I beg
And meditate the fact 'twixt sip and sip 
This settled why I pleased myself you saw
By turning blot and blot into a line
O' the little scale we 'll try now as your tongue
Tries the concluding sugar-drop what  meant
To please me most o' the great scale Why just now
With nothing else to do within my reach
Did I prefer making two blots one line
To making yet another separate
Third blot and leaving those I found unlinked
It meant I like to use the thing I find
Rather than strive at unfound novelty
I make the best of the old nor try for new
Such will to act such choice of action way
Constitute when at work on the great scale
Driven to their farthest natural consequence
By all the help from all the means my own
Particular faculty of serving God
Instinct for putting power to exercise
Upon some wish and want o' the time I prove
Possible to mankind as best I may
This constitutes my mission grant the phrase 
Namely to rule men men within my reach
To order influence and dispose them so
As render solid and stabilify
Mankind in particles the light and loose
For their good and my pleasure in the act
Such good accomplished proves twice good to me 
Good for its own sake as the just and right
And in the effecting also good again
To me its agent tasked as suits my taste
Is this much easy to be understood
At first glance Now begin the steady gaze
My rank if I must tell you simple truth 
Telling were else not worth the whiff o' the weed
I lose for the tale sake dear my rank i' the world
Is hard to know and name precisely err
I may but scarcely overestimate
My style and title Do I class with men
Most useful to their fellows Possibly 
Therefore in some sort best but greatest mind
And rarest nature Evidently no
A conservator call me if you please
Not a creator nor destroyer one
Who keeps the world safe I profess to trace
The broken circle of society
Dim actual order I can redescribe
Not only where some segment silver-true
Stays clear but where the breaks of black commence
Baffling you all who want the eye to probe 
As I make out yon problematic thin
White paring of your thumb-nail outside there
Above the plaster-monarch on his steed 
See an inch name an ell and prophesy
O' the rest that ought to follow the round moon
Now hiding in the night of things that round
I labor to demonstrate moon enough
For the month purpose that society
Render efficient for the age need
Preserving you in either case the old
Nor aiming at a new and greater thing
A sun for moon a future to be made
By first abolishing the present law
No such proud task for me by any means
History shows you men whose master-touch
Not so much modifies as makes anew
Minds that transmute nor need restore at all
A breath of God made manifest in flesh
Subjects the world to change from time to time
Alters the whole conditions of our race
Abruptly not by unperceived degrees
Nor play of elements already there
But quite new leaven leavening the lump
And liker so the natural process See
Where winter reigned for ages by a turn
I' the time some star-change ask geologists
The ice-tracts split clash splinter and disperse
And there  an end of immobility
Silence and all that tinted pageant base
To pinnacle one flush from fairy-land
Dead-asleep and deserted somewhere see 
As a fresh sun wave spring and joy outburst
Or else the earth it is time starts from trance
Her mountains tremble into fire her plains
Heave blinded by confusion what result
New teeming growth surprises of strange life
Impossible before a world broke up
And re-made order gained by law destroyed
Not otherwise in our society
Follow like portents all as absolute
Regenerations they have birth at rare
Uncertain unexpected intervals
O' the world by ministry impossible
Before and after fulness of the days
Some dervish desert-spectre swordsman saint
Lawgiver lyrist oh we know the names
Quite other these than I Our time requires
No such strange potentate who else would dawn 
No fresh force till the old have spent itself
Such seems the natural economy
To shoot a beam into the dark assists
To make that beam do fuller service spread
And utilize such bounty to the height
That assists also and that work is mine
I recognize contemplate and approve
The general compact of society
Not simply as I see effected good
But good i' the germ each chance that  possible
I' the plan traced so far all results in short
For better or worse of the operation due
To those exceptional natures unlike mine
Who helping thwarting conscious unaware
Did somehow manage to so far describe
This diagram left ready to my hand
Waiting my turn of trial I see success
See failure see what makes or mars throughout
How shall I else but help complete this plan
Of which I know the purpose and approve
By letting stay therein what seems to stand
And adding good thereto of easier reach
To-day than yesterday So much no more
Whereon No more than that inquire aggrieved
Half of my critics nothing new at all
The old plan saved instead of a sponged slate
And fresh-drawn figure while So much as that
Object their fellows of the other faith
Leave uneffaced the crazy labyrinth
Of alteration and amendment lines
Which every dabster felt in duty bound
To signalize his power of pen and ink
By adding to a plan once plain enough
Why keep each fool bequeathment scratch and blur
Which overscrawl and underscore the piece 
Nay strengthen them by touches of your own
Well that  my mission so I serve the world
Figure as man o' the moment in default
Of somebody inspired to strike such change
Into society from round to square
The ellipsis to the rhomboid how you please
As suits the size and shape o' the world he finds
But this I can and nobody my peer 
Do the best with the least change possible
Carry the incompleteness on a stage
Make what was crooked straight and roughness smooth
And weakness strong wherein if I succeed
It will not prove the worst achievement sure
In the eyes at least of one man one I look
Nowise to catch in critic company
To wit the man inspired the genius' self
Destined to come and change things thoroughly
He at least finds his business simplified
Distinguishes the done from undone reads
Plainly what meant and did not mean this time
We live in and I work on and transmit
To such successor he will operate
On good hard substance not mere shade and shine
Let all my critics born to idleness
And impotency get their good and have
Their hooting at the giver I am deaf 
Who find great good in this society
Great gain the purchase of great labor Touch
The work I may and must but reverent
In every fall o' the finger-tip no doubt
Perhaps I find all good there  warrant for
I' the world as yet nay to the end of time 
Since evil never means part company
With mankind only shift side and change shape
I find advance i' the main and notably
The Present an improvement on the Past
And promise for the Future which shall prove
Only the Present with its rough made smooth
Its indistinctness emphasized I hope
No better nothing newer for mankind
But something equably smoothed everywhere
Good reconciled with hardly-quite-as-good
Instead of good and bad each jostling each
And that  all Ay and quite enough for me
We have toiled so long to gain what gain I find
I' the Present let us keep it We shall toil
So long before we gain if gain God grant 
A Future with one touch of difference
I' the heart of things and not their outside face 
Let us not risk the whiff of my cigar
For Fourier Comte and all that ends in smoke
This I see clearest probably of men
With power to act and influence now alive
Juster than they to the true state of things
In consequence more tolerant that side
By side shall co-exist and thrive alike
In the age the various sorts of happiness
Moral mark not material moods o' the mind
Suited to man and man his opposite
Say minor modes of movement hence to there
Or thence to here or simply round about 
So long as each toe spares its neighbor kibe
Nor spoils the major march and main advance
The love of peace care for the family
Contentment with what  bad but might be worse 
Good movements these and good too discontent
So long as that spurs good which might be best
Into becoming better anyhow
Good pride of country putting hearth and home
I' the background out of undue prominence
Good yearning after change strife victory
And triumph Each shall have its orbit marked
But no more none impede the other path
In this wide world though each and all alike
Save for me fain would spread itself through space
And leave its fellow not an inch of way
I rule and regulate the course excite
Restrain because the whole machine should march
Impelled by those diversely-moving parts
Each blind to aught beside its little bent
Out of the turnings round and round inside
Comes that straightforward world-advance I want
And none of them supposes God wants too
And gets through just their hindrance and my help
I think that to have held the balance straight
For twenty years say weighing claim and claim
And giving each its due no less no more
This was good service to humanity
Right usage of my power in head and heart
And reasonable piety beside
Keep those three points in mind while judging me
You stand perhaps for some one man not men 
Represent this or the other interest
Nor mind the general welfare so impugn
My practice and dispute my value why
You man of faith I did not tread the world
Into a paste and thereof make a smooth
Uniform mound whereon to plant your flag
The lily-white above the blood and brains
Nor yet did I you man of faithlessness
So roll things to the level which you love
That you could stand at ease there and survey
The universal Nothing undisgraced
By pert obtrusion of some old church-spire
I' the distance Neither friend would I content
Nor as the world were simply meant for him
Thrust out his fellow and mend God mistake
Why you two fools my dear friends all the same 
Is it some change o' the world and nothing else
Contents you Should whatever was not be
How thanklessly you view things There  the root
Of the evil source of the entire mistake
You see no worth i' the world nature and life
Unless we change what is to what may be
Which means may be i' the brain of one of you
Reject what is all capabilities 
Nay you may style them chances if you choose 
All chances then of happiness that lie
Open to anybody that is born
Tumbles into this life and out again 
All that may happen good and evil too
I' the space between to each adventurer
Upon this 'sixty Anno Domini
A life to live and such a life a world
To learn one lifetime in and such a world
How did the foolish ever pass for wise
By calling life a burden man a fly
Or worm or what  most insignificant
O littleness of man deplores the bard
And then for fear the Powers should punish him
O grandeur of the visible universe
Our human littleness contrasts withal
O sun O moon ye mountains and thou sea
Thou emblem of immensity thou this
That and the other what impertinence
In man to eat and drink and walk about
And have his little notions of his own
The while some wave sheds foam upon the shore
First of all 't is a lie some three-times thick
The bard this sort of speech being poetry 
The bard puts mankind well outside himself
And then begins instructing them This way
I and my friend the sea conceive of you
What would you give to think such thoughts as ours
Of you and the sea together Down they go
On the humbled knees of them at once they draw
Distinction recognize no mate of theirs
In one despite his mock humility
So plain a match for what he plays with Next
The turn of the great ocean-playfellow
When the bard leaving Bond Street very far
From ear-shot cares not to ventriloquize
But tells the sea its home-truths You my match
You all this terror and immensity
And what not Shall I tell you what you are
Just fit to hitch into a stanza so
Wake up and set in motion who  asleep
O' the other side of you in England else
Unaware as folk pace their Bond Street now
Somebody here despises them so much
Between us they are the ultimate to them
And their perception go these lordly thoughts
Since what were ocean mane and tail to boot 
Mused I not here how make thoughts thinkable
Start forth my stanza and astound the world
Back billows to your insignificance
Deep you are done with Learn my gifted friend
Anyhow fact or fancy such its birth
I was exploring some huge house had gone
Through room and room complacently no dearth
Anywhere of the signs of decent taste
Adequate culture wealth had run to waste
Nowise nor penury was proved by stint
All showed the Golden Mean without a hint
Of brave extravagance that breaks the rule
The master of the mansion was no fool
Assuredly no genius just as sure
Safe mediocrity had scorned the lure
Of now too much and now too little cost
And satisfied me sight was never lost
Of moderate design accomplishment
In calm completeness On and on I went
With no more hope than fear of what came next
Till lo I push a door sudden uplift
A hanging enter chance upon a shift
Indeed of scene So thus it is thou deck'st
High heaven our low earth brick-and-mortar work
It was the Chapel That a star from murk
Which hid should flashingly emerge at last
Were small surprise but from broad day I passed
Into a presence that turned shine to shade
There fronted me the Rafael Mother-Maid
Never to whom knelt votarist in shrine
By Nature bounty helped by Art divine
More varied beauty with magnificence 
Than this from floor to roof one evidence
Of how far earth may rival heaven No niche
Where glory was not prisoned to enrich
Man gaze with gold and gems no space but glowed
With color gleamed with carving hues which owed
Their outburst to a brush the painter fed
With rainbow-substance rare shapes never wed
To actual flesh and blood which brain-born once
Became the sculptor dowry Art response
To earth despair And all seemed old yet new
Youth in the marble curve the canvas' hue
Apparent wanted not the crowning thrill
Of age the consecrator Hands long still
Had worked here could it be what lent them skill
Retained a power to supervise protect
Enforce new lessons with the old connect
Our life with theirs No merely modern touch
Told me that here the artist doing much
Elsewhere did more perchance does better lives 
So needs must learn Well these provocatives
Having fulfilled their office forth I went
Big with anticipation well-nigh fear 
Of what next room and next for startled eyes
Might have in store surprise beyond surprise
Next room and next and next what followed here
Why nothing not one object to arrest
My passage everywhere too manifest
The previous decent null and void of best
And worst mere ordinary right and fit
Calm commonplace which neither missed nor hit
Inch-high inch-low the placid mark proposed
Armed with this instance have I diagnosed
Your case my Christopher The man was sound
And sane at starting all at once the ground
Gave way beneath his step a certain smoke
Curled up and caught him or perhaps down broke
A fireball wrapping flesh and spirit both
In conflagration Then as heaven were loth
To linger let earth understand too well
How heaven at need can operate off fell
The flame-robe and the untransfigured man
Resumed sobriety as he began
So did he end nor alter pace not he
Now what I fain would know is could it be
That he whoe'er he was that furnished forth
The Chapel making thus from South to North
Rafael touch Leighton Michelagnolo
Join Watts was found but once combining so
The elder and the younger taking stand
On Art supreme or that yourself who sang
A Song where flute-breath silvers trumpet-clang
And stations you for once on either hand
With Milton and with Keats empowered to claim
Affinity on just one point or blame
Or praise my judgment thus it fronts you full 
How came it you resume the void and null
Subside to insignificance live die
 Proved plainly two mere mortals who drew nigh
One moment that to Art best hierarchy
This to the superhuman poet-pair
What if in one point only then and there
The otherwise all-unapproachable
Allowed impingement Does the sphere pretend
To span the cube breadth cover end to end
The plane with its embrace No surely Still
Contact is contact sphere touch no whit less
Than cube superimposure Such success
Befell Smart only out of throngs between
Milton and Keats that donned the singing-dress 
Smart solely of such songmen pierced the screen
'Twixt thing and word lit language straight from soul 
Left no fine film-flake on the naked coal
Live from the censer shapely or uncouth
Fire-suffused through and through one blaze of truth
Undeadened by a lie you have my mind 
For think this blaze outleapt with black behind
And blank before when Hayley and the rest 
But let the dead successors worst and best
Bury their dead with life be my concern 
Yours with the fire-flame what I fain would learn
Is just suppose me haply ignorant
Down to the common knowledge doctors vaunt
Just this why only once the fire-flame was
No matter if the marvel came to pass
The way folk judged if power too long suppressed
Broke loose and maddened as the vulgar guessed
Or simply brain-disorder doctors said
A turmoil of the particles disturbed
Brain workaday performance in your head
Spurred spirit to wild action health had curbed
And so verse issued in a cataract
Whence prose before and after unperturbed
Was wont to wend its way Concede the fact
That here a poet was who always could 
Never before did never after would 
Achieve the feat how were such fact explained
Was it that when by rarest chance there fell
Disguise from Nature so that Truth remained
Naked and whoso saw for once could tell
Us others of her majesty and might
In large her lovelinesses infinite
In little straight you used the power wherewith
Sense penetrating as through rind to pith
Each object thoroughly revealed might view
And comprehend the old things thus made new
So that while eye saw soul to tongue could trust
Thing which struck word out and once more adjust
Real vision to right language till heaven vault
Pompous with sunset storm-stirred sea assault
On the swilled rock-ridge earth embosomed brood
Of tree and flower and weed with all the life
That flies or swims or crawls in peace or strife
Above below each had its note and name
For Man to know by Man who now the same
As erst in Eden needs that all he sees
Be named him ere he note by what degrees
Of strength and beauty to its end Design
Ever thus operates your thought and mine
No matter for the many dissident 
So did you sing your Song so truth found vent
In words for once with you Then back was furled
The robe thus thrown aside and straight the world
Darkened into the old oft-catalogued
Repository of things that sky wave land
Or show or hide clear late accretion-clogged
Now just as long ago by tellings and
Re-tellings to satiety which strike
Muffled upon the ear drum Very like
None was so startled as yourself when friends
Came hailed your fast-returning wits Health mends
Importantly for to be plain with you 
This scribble on the wall was done in lieu
Of pen and paper with ha ha your key
Denting it on the wainscot Do you see
How wise our caution was Thus much we stopped
Of babble that had else grown print and lopped
From your trim bay-tree this unsightly bough 
Smart who translated Horace Write us now 
Why what Smart did write never afterward
One line to show that he who paced the sward
Had reached the zenith from his madhouse cell
Was it because you judged I know full well
You never had the fancy judged as some 
That who makes poetry must reproduce
Thus ever and thus only as they come
Each strength each beauty everywhere diffuse
Throughout creation so that eye and ear
Seeing and hearing straight shall recognize
At touch of just a trait the strength appear 
Suggested by a line lapse see arise
All evident the beauty fresh surprise
Startling at fresh achievement So indeed
Wallows the whale bulk in the waste of brine
Nor otherwise its feather-tufts make fine
Wild Virgin Bower when stars faint off to seed
My prose your poetry I dare not give
Purpling too much my mere gray argument
 Was it because you judged when fugitive
Was glory found and wholly gone and spent
Such power of startling up deaf ear blind eye
At truth appearance that you humbly bent
The head and bidding vivid work good-by
Doffed lyric dress and trod the world once more
A drab-clothed decent proseman as before
Strengths beauties by one word flash thus laid bare
 That was effectual service made aware
Of strengths and beauties Man but hears the text
Awaits your teaching Nature What comes next
Why all the strength and beauty to be shown
Thus in one word flash thenceforth let alone
By Man who needs must deal with aught that  known
Never so lately and so little Friend
First give us knowledge then appoint its use
Strength beauty are the means ignore their end
As well you stopped at proving how profuse
Stones sticks nay stubble lie to left and right
Ready to help the builder careless quite
If he should take or leave the same to strew
Earth idly as by word flash bring in view
Strength beauty then bid who beholds the same
Go on beholding Why gains unemployed
Nature was made to be by Man enjoyed
First followed duly by enjoyment fruit
Instruction haply leaving joy behind
And you the instructor would you slack pursuit
Of the main prize as poet help mankind
Just to enjoy there leave them Play the fool
Abjuring a superior privilege
Please simply when your function is to rule 
By thought incite to deed From edge to edge
Of earth round strength and beauty everywhere
Pullulate and must you particularize
All each and every apparition Spare
Yourself and us the trouble Ears and eyes
Want so much strength and beauty and no less
Nor more to learn life lesson by Oh yes 
The other method  favored in our day
The end ere the beginning as you may
Master the heavens before you study earth
Make you familiar with the meteor birth
Ere you descend to scrutinize the rose
I say o'erstep no least one of the rows
That lead man from the bottom where he plants
Foot first of all to life last ladder-top
Arrived there vain enough will seem the vaunts
Of those who say We scale the skies then drop
To earth to find how all things there are loth
To answer heavenly law we understand
The meteor course and lo the rose growth 
How other than should be by law command
Would not you tell such Friends beware lest fume
Offuscate sense learn earth first ere presume
To teach heaven legislation Law must be
Active in earth or nowhere earth you see 
Or there or not at all Will Power and Love
Admit discovery as below above
Seek next law confirmation But reverse
The order where  the wonder things grow worse
Than by the law your fancy formulates
They should be Cease from anger at the fates
Which thwart themselves so madly Live and learn
Not first learn and then live is our concern
Ah George Bubb Dodington Lord Melcombe no
Yours was the wrong way always understand
Supposing that permissibly you planned
How statesmanship your trade in outward show
Might figure as inspired by simple zeal
For serving country king and commonweal
Though service tire to death the body tease
The soul from out an o'ertasked patriot-drudge
And yet should prove zeal outward show agrees
In all respects right reason being judge 
With inward care that while the statesman spends
Body and soul thus freely for the sake
Of public good his private welfare take
No harm by such devotedness Intends
Scripture aught else let captious folk inquire 
Which teaches Laborers deserve their hire
And who neglects his household bears the bell
Away of sinning from an infidel
Wiselier would fools that carp bestow a thought
How birds build nests at outside roughly wrought
Twig knots with twig loam plasters up each chink
Leaving the inmate rudely lodged you think
Peep but inside That specious rude-and-rough
Covers a domicile where downy fluff
Embeds the ease-deserving architect
Who toiled and moiled not merely to effect
'Twixt sprig and spray a stop-gap in the teeth
Of wind and weather guard what swung beneath
From upset only but contrived himself
A snug interior warm and soft and sleek
Of what material Oh for that you seek
How nature prompts each volatile Thus pelf
Smoothens the human mudlark lodging power
Demands some hardier wrappage to embrace
Robuster heart-beats rock not tree nor tower
Contents the building eagle rook shoves close
To brother rook on branch while crow morose
Apart keeps balance perched on topmost bough
No sort of bird but suits his taste somehow
Nay Darwin tells of such as love the bower 
His bower-birds opportunely yield us yet
The lacking instance when at loss to get
A feathered parallel to what we find
The secret motor of some mighty mind
That worked such wonders all for vanity
Worked them to haply figure in the eye
Of intimates as first of doers' kind
Actors' that work in earnest sportively
Paid by a sourish smile How says the Sage
Birds born to strut prepare a platform-stage
With sparkling stones and speckled shells all sorts
Of slimy rubbish odds and ends and orts
Whereon to pose and posture and engage
The priceless female simper I have gone
Thus into detail George Bubb Dodington
Lest when I take you presently to task
For the wrong way of working you should ask
What fool conjectures that profession means
Performance that who goes behind the scenes
Finds acting over still the soot-stuff screens
Othello visage still the self-same cloak's
Bugle-bright-blackness half reveals half chokes
Hamlet emotion as ten minutes since
No each resumes his garb stands Moor or prince 
Decently draped just so with statesmanship
All outside show in short is sham why wince
Concede me while our parley lasts You trip
Afterwards lay but this to heart there lurks
Somewhere in all of us a lump which irks
Somewhat the spriteliest-scheming brain that  bent
On brave adventure would but heart consent
 Here trip you that your aim allowed as right 
Your means thereto were wrong Come we this night
Profess one purpose hold one principle
Are at odds only as to not the will
But way of winning solace for ourselves
 No matter if the ore for which zeal delves
Be gold or coprolite while zeal pretence
Is we do good to men at whose expense
But ours who tire the body tease the soul
Simply that running we may reach fame goal
And wreathe at last our brows with bay the State's
Disinterested slaves nay please the Fates 
Saviors and nothing less such lot has been
Statesmanship triumphs pedestalled serene 
O happy consummation brought about
By managing with skill the rabble-rout
For which we labor never mind the name 
People or populace for praise or blame
Making them understand their heaven their hell
Their every hope and fear is ours as well
Man cause what other can we have at heart
Whence follows that the necessary part
High o'er Man head we play and freelier breathe
Just that the multitude which gasps beneath
May reach the level where unstifled stand
Ourselves at vantage to put forth a hand
Assist the prostrate public 'T is by right
Merely of such pretence we reach the height
Where storms abound to brave nay court their stress
Though all too well aware of pomp the less
Of peace the more But who are we to spurn
For peace' sake duty pointing Up then earn
Albeit no prize we may but martyrdom
Now such fit height to launch salvation from
How get and gain Since help must needs be craved
By would-be saviours of the else-unsaved
How coax them to co-operate lend a lift
Kneel down and let us mount You say Make shift
By sham the harsh word preach and teach persuade
Somehow the Public not despising aid
Of salutary artifice we seek
Solely their good our strength would raise the weak
Our cultivated knowledge supplement
Their rudeness rawness why to us were lent
Ability except to come in use
Who loves his kind must by all means induce
That kind to let his love play freely press
In Man behalf to full performance Yes 
Yes George we know whereat they hear believe
And bend the knee and on the neck receive
Who fawned and cringed to purpose Not so George
Try simple falsehood on shrewd folk who forge
Lies of superior fashion day by day
And hour by hour With craftsmen versed as they
What chance of competition when the tools
Only a novice wields Are knaves such fools
Disinterested patriots spare your tongue
The tones thrice-silvery cheek save smiles it flung
Pearl-like profuse to swine a herd whereof
No unit needs be taught his neighbor trough
Scarce holds for who but grunts and whines the husks
Due to a wrinkled snout that shows sharp tusks
No animal much less our lordly Man 
Obeys its like with strength all rule began
The stoutest awes the pasture Soon succeeds
Discrimination nicer power Man needs
To rule him than is bred of bone and thew
Intelligence must move strength self This too
Lasts but its time the multitude at length
Looks inside for intelligence and strength
And finds them here and there to pick and choose
All at your service mine see Ay but who's
My George at this late day to make his boast
In strength intelligence I rule the roast
Beat all and some the ungraced who crowd your ranks
Oh but I love would lead you gain your thanks
By unexampled yearning for Man sake 
Passion that solely waits your help to take
Effect in action George which one of us
But holds with his own heart communion thus
I am if not of men the first and best
Still to receive enjoyment properest
Which since by force I cannot nor by wit
Most likely craft must serve in place of it
Flatter cajole If so I bring within
My net the gains which wit and force should win
What hinders 'T is a trick we know of old
Try George some other of tricks manifold
The multitude means mass and mixture right
Are mixtures simple pray or composite
Dive into Man your medley see the waste
Sloth-stifled genius energy disgraced
By ignorance high aims with sorry skill
Will without means and means in want of will
 Sure we might fish from out the mothers' sons
That welter thus a dozen Dodingtons
Why call up Dodington and none beside
To take his seat upon our backs and ride
As statesman conquering and to conquer Well
The last expedient which must needs excel
Those old ones this it is at any rate
To-day conception thus I formulate
As simple force has been replaced just so
Must simple wit be men have got to know
Such wit as what you boast is nowise held
The wonder once it was but paralleled
Too plentifully counts not puts to shame
Modest possessors like yourself who claim
By virtue of it merely power and place
 Which means the sweets of office Since our race
Teems with the like of you some special gift
Your very own must coax our hands to lift
And backs to bear you is it just and right
To privilege your nature State things quite
Other than so make answer I pretend
No such community with men Perpend
My key to domination Who would use
Man for his pleasure needs must introduce
The element that awes Man Once for all
His nature owns a Supernatural
In fact as well as phrase which found must he
 Where in this doubting age Old mystery
Has served its turn seen through and sent adrift
To nothingness new wizard-craft makes shift
Nowadays shorn of help by robe and book 
Otherwise elsewhere for success must look
Than chalked-ring incantation-gibberish
Somebody comes to conjure that  he Pish
He  like the roomful of rapt gazers there's
No sort of difference in the garb he wears
From ordinary dressing gesture speech
Deportment just like those of all and each
That eye their master of the minute Stay
What of the something call it how you may 
Uncanny in the quack That  easy said
Notice how the Professor turns no head
And yet takes cognizance of who accepts
Denies is puzzled as to the adept's
Supremacy yields up or lies in wait
To trap the trickster Doubtless out of date
Are dealings with the devil yet the stir
Of mouth its smile half smug half sinister
Mock-modest boldness masked in diffidence 
What if the man have who knows how or whence 
Confederate potency unguessed by us 
Prove no such cheat as he pretends Ay thus
Had but my George played statesmanship new card
That carries all Since we avers the Bard 
All of us have one human heart as good
As say by all of us is understood
Right and wrong true and false in rough at least
We own a common conscience God man beast 
How should we qualify the statesman-shape
I fancy standing with our world agape
Disguise flee fight against with tooth and nail
The outrageous designation Quack men quail
Before You see a little year ago
They heard him thunder at the thing which lo
To-day he vaunts for unscathed while what erst
Heaven-high he lauded lies hell-low accursed
And yet where  change Who awe-struck cares to point
Critical finger at a dubious joint
In armor true aes triplex breast and back
Binding about defiant of attack
An imperturbability that  well
Or innocence or impudence how tell
One from the other Could ourselves broach lies
Yet brave mankind with those unaltered eyes
Those lips that keep the quietude of truth
Dare we attempt the like What quick uncouth
Disturbance of thy smug economy
O coward visage Straight would all descry
Back on the man brow the boy blush once more
No he goes deeper could our sense explore 
Finds conscience beneath conscience such as ours
Genius is not so rare prodigious powers 
Well others boast such but a power like this
Mendacious intrepidity quid vis
Besides imposture plays another game
Admits of no diversion from its aim
Of captivating hearts sets zeal aflare
In every shape at every turn nowhere
Allows subsidence into ash By stress
Of what does guile succeed but earnestness
Earnest word look and gesture Touched with aught
But earnestness the levity were fraught
With ruin to guile film-work Grave is guile
Here no act wants its qualifying smile
Its covert pleasantry to neutralize
The outward ardor Can our chief despise
Even while most he seems to adulate
As who should say What though it be my fate
To deal with fools Among the crowd must lurk
Some few with faculty to judge my work
Spite of its way which suits they understand
The crass majority the Sacred Band
No duping them forsooth So tells a touch
Of subintelligential nod and wink 
Turning foes friends Coarse flattery moves the gorge
Mine were the mode to awe the many George
They guess you half despise them while most bent
On demonstrating that your sole intent
Strives for their service Sneer at them Yourself
'T is you disparage tricksy as an elf
Scorning what most you strain to bring to pass
Laughingly careless triply cased in brass 
While pushing strenuous to the end in view
What follows Why you formulate within
The vulgar headpiece this conception Win
A master-mind to serve us needs we must
One who from motives we but take on trust
Acts strangelier haply wiselier than we know
Stronglier for certain Did he say 'I throw
Aside my good for yours in all I do
Care nothing for myself and all for you' 
We should both understand and disbelieve
Said he 'Your good I laugh at in my sleeve
My own it is I solely labor at
Pretending yours the while' that even that
We understanding well give credence to
And so will none of it But here 't is through
Our recognition of his service wage
Well earned by work he mounts to such a stage
Above competitors as all save Bubb
Would agonize to keep Yet here  the rub 
So slightly does he hold by our esteem
Which solely fixed him fast there that we seem
Mocked every minute to our face by gibe
And jest scorn insuppressive what ascribe
The rashness to Our pay and praise to boot 
Do these avail him to tread under foot
Something inside us all and each that stands
Somehow instead of somewhat which commands
'Lie not' Folk fear to jeopardize their soul
Stumble at times walk straight upon the whole 
That  nature simple instinct what may be
The portent here the influence such as we
Are strangers to Exact the thing I call
Man despot just the Supernatural
Which George was wholly out of far beyond
Your theory and practice You had conned
But to reject the precept To succeed
In gratifying selfishness and greed
Asseverate such qualities exist
Nowise within yourself then make acquist
By all means with no sort of fear Alack
That well-worn lie is obsolete Fall back
On still a working pretext Hearth and Home
The Altar love of England hate of Rome 
That  serviceable lying that perchance
Had screened you decently but 'ware advance
By one step more in perspicacity
Of these our dupes At length they get to see
As through the earlier this the latter plea 
And find the greed and selfishness at source
Ventum est ad triarios last resource
Should be to what but exquisite disguise
Disguise-abjuring truth that looks like lies
Frankness so sure to meet with unbelief
Say you hold in contempt not them in chief 
But first and foremost your own self No use
In men but to make sport for you induce
The puppets now to dance now stand stock-still
Now knock their heads together at your will
For will sake only while each plays his part
Submissive why through terror at the heart
Can it be this bold man whose hand we saw
Openly pull the wires obeys some law
Quite above Man nay God On face fall they
This was the secret missed again I say
Out of your power to grasp conception of
Much less employ to purpose Hence the scoff
That greets your very name folk see but one
Fool more as well as knave in Dodington
